0,"Oct 18, 2020 12:46PM EDT","On Wednesday, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) will report its third-quarter results. After announcing record third-quarter deliveries, expectations for the electric-car maker's financial performance during the period are high. Even more, a soaring stock price over the past year has raised the stakes for Tesla to keep growing its business rapidly.Will the automaker be able to live up to the hype?Ahead of the earnings report on Wednesday, some investors may be wondering whether or not they should buy shares of the growth stock before the update. After all, if Tesla announces better-than-expected revenue and earnings per share, the stock could jump.To better understand whether the electric-car company's shares are attractive today, here's a quick earnings preview and an analysis of the stock's current valuation.Model X. Image source: The Motley Fool.Earlier this month, Tesla said it delivered a record 139,300 vehicles during its third quarter. This was a huge jump from Q2 -- when the automaker's main vehicle factory temporarily forced to shut down because of the coronavirus. Vehicle deliveries surged 53% sequentially in Q3. However, growth was also impressive when compared to the year-ago quarter -- a period Tesla's operations were at full capacity. Deliveries soared 43% year over year.In 2020, Tesla's business is benefiting from the launch of its new Model Y SUV earlier this year. As the company's most affordable vehicle yet, management expects Model Y sales to eventually rival sales of is Model 3 -- Tesla's best-selling vehicle.Model Y. Image source: Tesla.Analysts expect Tesla's strong sales growth to lead to impressive top- and bottom-line growth, too. On average, analysts expect revenue to rise 31% year over year to $8.26 billion and non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share to jump 51% to $0.56.With Tesla's business firing on all cylinders, is Tesla stock a buy ahead of earnings?The automaker's earnings report could, indeed, send the stock soaring following the report. But shares could just as easily crater if Tesla misses the mark in some area. It's simply too difficult to predict which direction the stock will move in the wake of the report.Even more, an investment in the stock should be based on an investors' view of the company's long-term potential anyway -- not based on the results of a single quarter.Zooming out beyond the current quarter, investors should note that Tesla stock's valuation already prices in massive growth over the next decade. The company has a market capitalization of more than $400 billion despite trailing-12-month revenue coming in at just $26 billion. Free cash flow, or excess cash flow left over after both regular operations and capital expenditures are taken care of, was just $800 million over this same period.The market has arguably already priced in both continued leadership in electric cars and significant market share gains in the overall global auto market. Because so much optimism is already priced into the stock, I'd prefer a better entry point than $445 per share. Perhaps if investors get lucky and the stock falls below $400 following the earnings report then the stock might begin to look attractive.For now, however, I'd rate Tesla stock a ""hold"" going into its earnings report on Wednesday. Of course, there's no guarantee Tesla stock will ever retreat to this level again. But I don't mind waiting on the sidelines, hoping for a more reasonable valuation.Tesla's third-quarter earnings will be posted after market close on Oct. 21.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

1,"Oct 18, 2020 10:51AM EDT","Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has set its sights on building an affordable car with a $25,000 starting price -- again. At the company's Battery Day last month, Tesla announced a slew of innovations designed to reduce battery production costs by up to 56% while also increasing range and power. As my Foolish colleague Daniel Sparks noted at the time, a new ""tabless"" cell design was the biggest breakthrough, but Tesla also discussed changes to the cells' form factor, battery chemistry, and manufacturing process, among other things.Working to bring down prices is the right strategic focus for Tesla. However, its stated goal of offering a $25,000 car within three years seems far-fetched. Additionally, with better, cheaper batteries on the way, it will be increasingly difficult for Tesla to meet its volume growth goals over the next few years.There are two facets to the first major challenge Tesla faces. The first relates to whether it will be able to reduce costs enough to earn a reasonable profit on a $25,000 car. After all, when Tesla ramped up deliveries of the cheaper (sub-$40,000) Model 3 variants last spring, its gross margin plunged to 18.9% in Q2 2019 -- and closer to 17% excluding regulatory credits -- down from around 25% in the second half of 2018. It quickly made the $35,000 standard-range Model 3 an ""off-menu"" option to push buyers to pricier versions that it could produce profitably.The cheapest version of the Model 3 available on Tesla's website is the ""standard range plus"" option, which has a starting price of $37,990. This variant has a 54-kWh battery. Third-party sources have put Tesla's 2019 battery costs between $127 per kWh and $158 per kWh. Even at the high end of that range, the battery for a standard range plus Tesla 3 would cost less than $9,000.Image source: Tesla.Thus, even if Tesla succeeds in all of its cost-reduction objectives related to batteries, the savings might be on the order of $5,000. That alone wouldn't get Tesla close to being able to make a $25,000 car profitably.The second issue relates to timing. Tesla did not bring a prototype of its new battery design to the Battery Day event. This raises questions about how far along it is in the development process, which requires solving some tricky problems. Moreover, Musk has frequently talked about how difficult it is to scale up manufacturing of new technologies, relative to just building a prototype.This makes it unlikely that a $25,000 vehicle could be available in as little as three years. Another reason to take this projection with a grain of salt? CEO Elon Musk said more than two years ago that a $25,000 Tesla could come to market in about three years (i.e. 2021). That obviously isn't happening.Another big challenge for Tesla is driving sales of its current products before the new battery technology becomes available. Musk has previously talked about targeting 50% annual growth in vehicle deliveries. At that pace, Tesla would deliver over 1.2 million vehicles in 2022 and more than 1.8 million vehicles in 2023.Image source: Tesla.Achieving that level of growth would be difficult under any circumstances. It requires moving well beyond the early adopters and enthusiasts. Additionally, there appears to be only one high-volume product on the way to help Tesla reach these numbers (the Cybertruck).This task will be complicated if people believe that Tesla will soon have vehicles on the market offering 50% or more additional range at significantly lower prices. Whereas early Model 3 buyers have seen their cars depreciate very little over the past few years, future buyers won't be so lucky if Tesla puts new products that are better and cheaper on the market by 2025.Of course, this isn't to say that Tesla shouldn't pursue advancements that will eventually reduce battery costs and improve performance. It is much better to disrupt your existing products than to wait for a competitor to do so. But investors shouldn't ignore the impact of this coming disruption to Tesla's products and pricing, either.All in all, Tesla's Battery Day presentation showed that the company is focused on the right goal: driving down costs to make its vehicles more affordable. Tesla wouldn't be able to meet its long-term growth goals or fulfill its mission ""to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy"" with its current product portfolio.Furthermore, while Tesla has plenty of work to do to achieve the specific target of a $25,000 car, it has a more credible game plan for reducing costs than it did when Musk talked about this goal back in 2018.However, while Tesla appears to be on the right track, it's not clear how far down the track -- and thus, how far ahead of competitors -- the electric vehicle pioneer is right now. As a result, I would be wary of investing in Tesla at its premium valuation of more than $400 billion.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

2,"Oct 18, 2020 9:00AM EDT","By John McCrankNEW YORK, Oct 16 (Reuters) - As a technology-driven rally brings U.S. stock indexes within striking distance of fresh records, concerns that big names are over-extended and thatnew regulation might be coming have some investors diversifying beyond the rally leaders.The S&P 500's five biggest companies, Apple Inc AAPL.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O and Facebook Inc FB.O now account for 28% of the index's weighting and have been responsible for 25% of its earnings, Goldman Sachs said earlier this month.On average, these tech and internet-driven stocks have gained 49.23% this year, compared to a 7% gain for the S&P 500 - and are up 9.6% on average since Sept. 21, versus 6.6% for the S&P 500. They are expected to report strong third-quarter earnings in coming weeks, proving their mettle in a year when the coronavirus pandemic fueled a work-from-home economy while devastating companies linked to sectors like travel, restaurants, and fossil fuels.(Graphic: S&P 500's big tech boost https://tmsnrt.rs/2SUGbw3)Still, some worry that mega-cap tech companies are exposed to factors that may cut their allure in the months ahead. Being long technology is the most crowded trade of all time, according to a recent Bank of America fund manager survey. ""It's all about trying not to have all your eggs in one basket,"" said Laura Kane, head of Americas thematic investing at UBS Global Wealth Management. ""It's about trimming certain exposures and rotating into something else.""UBS analysts have recommended diversifying out of mega-cap tech stocks on signs of an economic recovery and climbing valuations. They urge rebalancing into U.S. semiconductors, which are more sensitive to economic recovery, as well as emerging market value stocks and United Kingdom-based equities.Societe Generale analysts also recently cited a challenging regulatory environment as one reason to diversify out of U.S. tech shares and into Asian ones and European stocks.Regulatory concerns have heightened following a scathing report detailing market power abuses by Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook issued earlier this month by the U.S. House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel. The report has raised concerns that tough new rules and stricter enforcement for big tech companies will follow should Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden win the White House. A potential breakthrough in the search for a COVID-19 vaccine also could also spur bets on shares of economically sensitive value and cyclical stocks that may benefit from a stronger economic recovery, potentially dimming the appeal of tech, Soc Gen analysts said. L1N2H61ZCThe median 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio for the Big 5 tech stocks is 31, while the S&P 500 trades at a 12-month forward PE ratio of 22, according to Refinitiv. Still, they are not as extended as in the dotcom period, with overall profitability, dividends and balance sheet strength in much better shape than 20 years ago. Companies investors will be watching next week as they report third-quarter results include Netflix Inc NFLX.O on Tuesday, Tesla Inc TSLA.O and Verizon Communication Inc VZ.N on Wednesday, and Intel Corp INTC.O on Thursday. Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook report the following week.Many investors still see the big tech names, with their strong balance sheets and financial results, as havens as coronavirus cases continue to climb and the economy struggles with a lack of new fiscal stimulus.""These companies deliver powerful profits,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors. ""People have to keep in mind that the five largest tech companies make more in earnings than the entire Russell 2000 combined, so this isn't the internet bubble.""It might be a good idea to trim some tech exposure if the position has gotten too overweighted, but the sector's gains are largely being driven by fundamentals, said Michael Farr, president of Farr, Miller & Washington LLC.To rotate out of tech because of big gains and some recent volatility would be ""a suckers' trade,"" he added.

3,"Oct 18, 2020 8:12AM EDT","The stock market’s strong rally from the March lows has indisputably been driven by Big Tech. But how much higher can we go, particularly amid the pandemic?We are certain to get answers to this question (and others) this week as the third quarter earnings season kicks into high gear with results expected from technology heavyweights Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX) — two FAANG components that have seen their stock prices rise within striking distance of all-time high levels. We will also get results from Microsoft (MSFT), Intel (INTC) and Tesla (TSLA) - each of which have something to prove. Among the three, Tesla will likely be the biggest story.The electric vehicle maker has promised to deliver 500,000 vehicles for the current fiscal year and analysts (and the bears) will be eager to see if Tesla, which has future plans of producing a fully autonomous electric car for $25,000, will double down on those projections. It will certainly be a drama-filled week that delivers many answers. On the investment front, we will know whether the recent rotation out of “growth” and into “value"" has lasting power.On average, analysts forecast Q3 earnings to rise 5% sequentially. And over the past three earnings earnings revisions have trended higher, rising by about 4.5%. You would have to go all the way back to the first quarter of 2018 to find the last time upward earnings revisions were this high. While that’s an encouraging figure, it has to be noted that it would still mark a 20% earnings decline year over year. Beyond the tech sector, analysts are encouraged by the recent strength in sectors such the consumer discretionary and cyclical sectors like industrials.Friday’s strong consumer sentiment data, combined with more optimism about additional fiscal stimulus, creates the perfect setup for a market rally this week. Conversely, the market is known to punish companies for falling short of expectations and issuing weak guidance. Here are this week's earnings names to keep an eye on:Netflix (NFLX) - Reports after the close, Tuesday, Oct. 20Wall Street expects Netflix to earn $2.13 per share on revenue of $6.38 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings were $1.47 per share on $5.24 billion in revenue.What to watch: Despite year-to-date gains of 67%, it still seems as if Netflix has moved under the radar so far in 2020. While the company didn’t excite investors with its second quarter miss on customer subscription totals, the 10 million it did deliver was 3 million more than its own guidance. What’s more, Q2 revenue rose 25% year over year to $6.15 billion, topping consensus estimates of $6.08 billion. In other words, there is still a lot to like with this story. The stock has risen about 9% over the past month as Covid cases continue to rise, suggesting more shelter-in-place restrictions could be underway. The streaming giant guided for only 2.5 million new subscribers in the just-ended quarter, which is 50% below consensus estimates. This tells me that Netflix put itself in a position for a strong beat on Tuesday.Microsoft (MSFT) - Reports after the close, Wednesday, Oct. 21Wall Street expects Microsoft to earn $1.54 per share on revenue of $35.72 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earning were $1.38 per share on $33.05 billion in revenue.What to watch: Work and learn-from-home trends continue to power increased demands for Microsoft services, evidenced by the strong Q4 demands in its Productivity and Business and Intelligent Cloud segments. But the strength of Microsoft’s Commercial Cloud business has been, and will continue to be, the catalyst for the stock’s strong year-to-date return of 40%. Last quarter Azure revenue was up 50% year over year — a slight deceleration from the 61% growth in Q3. Wall Street remains broadly positive about the company’s prospects to achieve double-digit revenue growth in fiscal 2021, driven by Azure's momentum. On Wednesday investors will want some evidence that Azure and Microsoft’s Teams (a Zoom (ZM) competitor) can continue to propel the company higher.Tesla (TSLA) - Reports after the close, Wednesday, Oct. 21Wall Street expects Tesla to earn 56 cents per share on revenue of $8.26 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to 37 cents per share on revenue of $6.3 billion.What to watch: With year-to-date gains of 430%, shares of Tesla have run over every bear standing in its way. While skeptics continue to scoff at the stock’s high valuation compared to the rest of the auto industry, the bears insist on relegating the company to just an auto-manufacturer. But when assessing the company’s growth trajectory and its diverse product portfolio, which — aside from electric vehicles — includes batteries, software, solar roof/panels, Tesla is more than a one-trick pony. It is a sustainable energy company. The question is, can the stock continue to drive higher Wednesday? That all depends on whether the company can deliver a GAAP profit for Q2 which would mark not only its fifth straight profitable quarter. In Q2 Tesla’s automotive margins fell to 18.7% in amid plant shutdowns.Amazon (AMZN) - Reports after the close, Thursday, Oct. 22Wall Street expects Amazon to earn $7.25 per share on revenue of $92.48 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to $4.23 per share on revenue of $69.98 billion.What to watch: Shares of Amazon have moved 5% higher this week as investors anticipate not only strong numbers from Prime Day, but also better-than-expected results for the Q3. The e-commerce giant is executing at near perfection evidenced by the 40% rise in total net revenue in the second quarter. The company is benefiting from a combination of factors. Aside from the strong demand acceleration caused by the pandemic, Amazon continues to be effective in its strategy not only to grow its Prime members, but also getting them to spend more during each transaction. And there is tons of evidence to suggests that its market share gains are here to stay, beyond the pandemic. As such, while some investors might be concerned about near-term margin pressure, it would be a mistake to part with this long-term winner.Intel (INTC) - Reports after the close, Thursday, Oct. 22Wall Street expects Intel to earn $1.11 per share on revenue of $18.22 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings were $1.42 per share on revenue of $19.19 billion.What to watch: What can Intel do to redeem itself? Its shares were clobbered by 12% following its second quarter announcement, during which the company said it would delay its 7nm-based chip by 18 months to two years. This seemingly gave Intel’s rivals, namely Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), a strong lead which would be hard for Intel to regain. The news overshadowed what was otherwise a great quarter as Data Center Group revenue soared 43%, driven by 47% increase in cloud service provider revenue. With the stock still down 10% year to date, Intel looks like a bargain. But the company on Thursday must show better execution and market share gains from improving demand in personal computer sales due to the work-from-home environment.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/weekly-preview%3A-stocks-to-watch-amzn-intc-msft-nflx-tsla-2020-10-18

4,"Oct 17, 2020 10:30AM EDT","It might seem odd that connected car specialist Cerence (NASDAQ: CRNC) has seen its shares jump by more than 150% so far this year, considering that the economy has entered a recession and the cyclical auto market is often the first to get hit under those macroeconomic circumstances, but the company has been scoring numerous design wins throughout 2020.That includes prominent deals like powering the voice control system in Volkswagen's new ID.3 electric vehicle, as well as collaborating with NIO, often billed as the ""Tesla of China."" With that momentum, can Cerence shares keep climbing?Image source: Cerence.On Friday, Needham initiated coverage on Cerence, starting the stock off with a buy rating alongside a price target of $82, representing 54% upside from Thursday's closing price.Analyst Rajvindra Gill believes that penetration of conversational artificial intelligence (AI) technology will more than double to over 60% in the next three to five years as cars continue to get smarter. Cerence, which was spun out of voice recognition specialist Nuance Communications last year, is the clear leader in the space, with a current installed base of 325 million cars that integrate its offerings. Half of all new cars shipped in 2019 featured Cerence technology.There are numerous factors that will drive that adoption, in Gill's view. Vehicles are increasingly needing access to real-time data like mapping and weather information, drivers are using more voice-controlled virtual assistants than ever before, and automakers keep looking for new ways to address the problem of distracted drivers. The rise of ride-sharing and shared mobility will also boost demand, as will autonomous driving and increasing adoption of electric vehicles that generally tend to be more technologically advanced.Cerence enjoys differentiation from its competitors by leveraging AI and deep learning to ""form the building blocks for the company's voice engine,"" according to Gill. The company's currently sources of revenue include licensing, connected revenue, and professional services, but Cerence is working to build a software-as-a-service (SaaS) business to generate recurring revenue. That initiative is still nascent, but it holds considerable potential to monetize the existing installed base of vehicles.The company's total addressable market is large and continues to grow. Additionally, Cerence has strong visibility into its future revenue pipeline since it currently has a backlog of approximately $1.4 billion. While the company warns that its backlog isn't a perfect proxy for future revenue because there are fixed and variable factors, CFO Mark Gallenberger expects half of the backlog to be recognized within the next three years, with the rest hitting the top line thereafter.Gill's price target is based on a hybrid model that leans on a multiples-based analysis and a discounted cash flow (DCF) model.10 stocks we like better than Cerence Inc.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

5,"Oct 17, 2020 7:20AM EDT","It's been an incredible year for special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, which in 2020 have become a preferred vehicle for early-stage companies wanting access to public markets.A SPAC, also known as a blank-check company, is a shell that goes public and then merges with an existing business. The alternative to a more traditional initial public offering has been used by a range of companies this year including DraftKings and Nikola.Investors were initially enamored, with shares of DraftKings and Nikola both more than doubling after their SPAC mergers closed. But recent issues at Nikola have tempered the enthusiasm for these stocks, and reminded investors of the risks that can be associated with young companies.It now appears the markets got ahead of themselves, and the SPACs were in a bubble. But that doesn't mean there aren't good companies with bright futures coming out of the excitement. Here is why we believe Kensington Capital Acquisition (NYSE: KCAC), Hyliion Holdings (NYSE: HYLN), and Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE: SPCE) are SPAC stocks that have what it takes to be long-term survivors.Image source: Getty Images.Lou Whiteman (Kensington Capital): On paper, Kensington Capital appears to be just the sort of company investors should treat with caution following the Nikola debacle. The SPAC has a deal in place to merge with QuantumScape, a pre-revenue start-up developing a better battery for electric vehicles.QuantumScape is working on a solid-state lithium-metal battery that in theory has a lot of advantages over the lithium-ion batteries currently in use. On paper the solid-state battery should be more stable and offer greater energy density than current generation of batteries. That means they should be safer and offer more miles per charge.The higher energy density should also lead to a need for fewer batteries, reducing the weight of a vehicle and over time hopefully bringing down the cost.There's a lot of ""should"" and ""hope"" written into that description, and indeed many have tried to push solid-state batteries forward without much success. QuantumScape's attractiveness comes from those who are backing it.Bill Gates is an investor, as is one-time Tesla Chief Technology Officer J.B. Straubel. Straubel, who is on QuantumScape's board, called the design ""the most elegant architecture I've seen for a lithium-based battery system,"" saying ""the company has an opportunity to redefine the battery landscape.""QuantumScape also counts Volkswagen as an investor and customer. Volkswagen is positioning itself to be a leader in electric vehicles, creating a huge potential market for QuantumScape batteries. And post-merger QuantumScape will have more than $1 billion in cash and funding commitments, giving it significant runway to get up and running.On the Kensington side, I'm encouraged that CEO Justin Mirro was involved in the due diligence leading up to the merger. Mirro is a longtime industry investment banker and one-time General Motors engineer who knows the auto business as well as anyone, and has a list full of contacts that can help QuantumScape go to market.Mirro is expected to remain on the board following the deal's close.John Rosevear (Hyliion): The fall of Nikola didn't just turn many investors away from SPACs, it also (to some extent) tarnished the idea of electric trucks as a potential growth industry.That's too bad, because Hyliion has a smart approach to the problem of cleaning up diesel-powered big rigs. Yep, it's a SPAC company -- it went public via a merger with SPAC Tortoise Acquisition last month -- but it's a real company, with a smart business plan and strong management. What makes Hyliion so smart is that it's not out to disrupt the heavy-truck business. Instead, it has neatly inserted itself into the heavy-truck supply chain with a solution that can clean up existing trucks, right now.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/spacs-are-in-a-bubble-but-these-3-stocks-will-make-it-through-2020-10-17

6,"Oct 16, 2020 4:35PM EDT","One of the more innovative and unusual customer-service policies in the auto industry might be coming to an abrupt end. Next-generation transportation and energy website Electrek reported on Friday that Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has decided to cancel its seven-calendar-day, no-questions-asked, full-refund return policy.Citing ""sources familiar with the matter,"" the article stated that Tesla pulled the plug on the policy Thursday night. The company web page that formerly spelled it out is now a redirect to a general support page (although a Google search for ""Tesla return policy"" yields a blurb of the old promise as its first result).The Electrek article's sources said that customers having issues with new cars and who desire a refund will instead be directed to Tesla's service department.Image source: Tesla.Under the old policy, owners of new cars could return their vehicles as long as the cars showed no damage and had fewer than 1,000 miles on the odometer. Tesla has not yet made any formal announcement about the status of the policy, nor has it responded to the article.The company has featured prominently in headlines over the past week. On Monday, it cut the price of its premium Model S sedan by $3,000. This was not the first reduction it made in 2020 (an earlier one was enacted in May), and it wasn't the last. A mere two days later, CEO Elon Musk announced in a tweet that the price would be lowered by another $2,570.Although abrupt changes in Tesla's business are the rule rather than the exception, investors might not be too happy with the elimination of that very confident return policy.

7,"Oct 16, 2020 4:02PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGeneral Electric (NYSE:GE) stock has had quite the saga — the company has been in turnaround mode for over three years now.GE has installed two different CEOs, sold off countless divisions, and made all sorts of strategic changes. It has also been through a variety of crises, both external and self-inflicted. Of course, this has made GE stock volatile, with plenty of ups and downs.So, the latest blow probably didn’t come as much of a surprise to shareholders.Last month, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) took an additional step toward disciplinary action against General Electric. While the company has faced plenty of heat from short sellers and credit ratings agencies, government regulators are a newer hazard.Still, GE stock has been able to come out relatively unscathed so far. Shares only fell for a few days, then quickly rebounded. And even in the wake of this added uncertainty, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) came to GE’s side, giving the stock a favorable rating.I’m inclined to agree. Despite GE’s many unresolved concerns, there is still a viable comeback story here.Two weeks ago, the SEC made its regulatory plans regarding GE known. As a result, General Electric issued the following disclosure:“On September 30, 2020, the SEC staff issued a “Wells notice” advising GE that it is considering recommending to the SEC that it bring a civil injunctive action against GE for possible violations of the securities laws. GE has been informed that the issues the SEC staff may recommend that the SEC pursue relate to the historical premium deficiency testing for GE Capital’s run-off insurance operations, as well as GE’s disclosures relating to such run-off insurance operations.”I’ve seen people overreacting to this, so let’s put it in context. A Wells notice doesn’t necessarily mean that the SEC has decided to bring enforcement actions against the company — instead it notifies them of the possibility. As GE notes in its press release, this is not a formal notice of wrongdoing or allegations of such. Further, GE will have a chance to present its case to the SEC before it brings official action against the company.That noted, this is still unequivocally bad news for GE stock. The SEC runs tons of background investigations on companies. It rarely gets to this step — particularly on a company as large and important as GE. This is even the case in the wake of controversies. For example, the SEC took a fairly light touch with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) — Elon Musk got to keep his position as CEO, and a $40 million fine is little more than a slap on the wrist in this context.Meanwhile, GE appears like it may get raked over the coals for events that happened back in 2018 and earlier.It’s not all bad news for General Electric though, despite the government investigation. Goldman Sachs has re-entered the playing field on GE.The famed investment bank had previously stopped coverage of General Electric in 2019, as it was advising that company on potential mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity. In 2019, when it dropped coverage, it merely held a “neutral” rating on GE stock.Now, however, GE’s analyst Joe Ritchie has issued a “buy” rating on GE stock. What’s more, he set an ambitious $10 price target, which represents a little over 25% upside from current share price. Ritchie wrote that the new GE is a “leaner, structurally more productive company with better capital discipline.” As the pandemic ends, Ritchie expects GE to improve its free cash flow generation dramatically.I’ve long made the bull argument for GE stock. There are some great assets at the company — and that hasn’t changed. With Larry Culp running General Electric, the firm now has a capable leader who can unlock the value of GE’s crown jewels.However, this process has been anything but easy. Even now, as 2020 winds down, GE is still paying the price for errors made by previous leadership. The SEC Wells notice — and any subsequent fines or penalties — is not the fault of current management.Still, these problems are painful. It seems every time GE stock is about to turn the corner, some new bad luck hits.But the fundamentals still point to GE’s eventual success. Goldman Sachs agrees, despite critics, skeptics and government scrutiny. As always, it’s not a fun or pleasant experience owning GE stock. However, its resilience in the wake of this latest setback should reassure shareholders.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Ian Bezek has written more than 1,000 articles for InvestorPlace.com and Seeking Alpha.

8,"Oct 16, 2020 1:21PM EDT","By John McCrankNEW YORK, Oct 16 (Reuters) - As a technology-driven rally brings U.S. stock indexes within striking distance of fresh records, concerns that big names are over-extended and thatnew regulation might be coming have some investors diversifying beyond the rally leaders.The S&P 500's five biggest companies, Apple Inc AAPL.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O and Facebook Inc FB.O now account for 28% of the index's weighting and have been responsible for 25% of its earnings, Goldman Sachs said earlier this month.On average, these tech and internet-driven stocks have gained 49.23% this year, compared to a 7% gain for the S&P 500 - and are up 9.6% on average since Sept. 21, versus 6.6% for the S&P 500. They are expected to report strong third-quarter earnings in coming weeks, proving their mettle in a year when the coronavirus pandemic fueled a work-from-home economy while devastating companies linked to sectors like travel, restaurants, and fossil fuels.(Graphic: S&P 500's big tech boost https://tmsnrt.rs/2SUGbw3)Still, some worry that mega-cap tech companies are exposed to factors that may cut their allure in the months ahead. Being long technology is the most crowded trade of all time, according to a recent Bank of America fund manager survey. ""It's all about trying not to have all your eggs in one basket,"" said Laura Kane, head of Americas thematic investing at UBS Global Wealth Management. ""It's about trimming certain exposures and rotating into something else.""UBS analysts have recommended diversifying out of mega-cap tech stocks on signs of an economic recovery and climbing valuations. They urge rebalancing into U.S. semiconductors, which are more sensitive to economic recovery, as well as emerging market value stocks and United Kingdom-based equities.Societe Generale analysts also recently cited a challenging regulatory environment as one reason to diversify out of U.S. tech shares and into Asian ones and European stocks.Regulatory concerns have heightened following a scathing report detailing market power abuses by Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook issued earlier this month by the U.S. House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel. The report has raised concerns that tough new rules and stricter enforcement for big tech companies will follow should Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden win the White House. A potential breakthrough in the search for a COVID-19 vaccine also could also spur bets on shares of economically sensitive value and cyclical stocks that may benefit from a stronger economic recovery, potentially dimming the appeal of tech, Soc Gen analysts said. L1N2H61ZCThe median 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio for the Big 5 tech stocks is 31, while the S&P 500 trades at a 12-month forward PE ratio of 22, according to Refinitiv. Still, they are not as extended as in the dotcom period, with overall profitability, dividends and balance sheet strength in much better shape than 20 years ago. Companies investors will be watching next week as they report third-quarter results include Netflix Inc NFLX.O on Tuesday, Tesla Inc TSLA.O and Verizon Communication Inc VZ.N on Wednesday, and Intel Corp INTC.O on Thursday. Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook report the following week.Many investors still see the big tech names, with their strong balance sheets and financial results, as havens as coronavirus cases continue to climb and the economy struggles with a lack of new fiscal stimulus.""These companies deliver powerful profits,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors. ""People have to keep in mind that the five largest tech companies make more in earnings than the entire Russell 2000 combined, so this isn't the internet bubble.""It might be a good idea to trim some tech exposure if the position has gotten too overweighted, but the sector's gains are largely being driven by fundamentals, said Michael Farr, president of Farr, Miller & Washington LLC.To rotate out of tech because of big gains and some recent volatility would be ""a suckers' trade,"" he added. ""Reports of their demise have been greatly exaggerated,"" he said of the big tech stocks.Graphic: S&P 500's big tech boosthttps://tmsnrt.rs/2SUGbw3(Reporting by John McCrank; Additional reporting by Saqib Ahmed and Ira Iosebashvili; Editing by Richard Chang)((john.mccrank@thomsonreuters.com Twitter @jmccrank; 1 646 223-6643; Reuters Messaging: john.mccrank.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/wall-st-week-ahead-big-tech-nervousness-prompts-calls-to-diversify-2020-10-16
