      "Haber:  Electric vehicle pioneer Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is attempting to revolutionize the automobile industry, and with visionary CEO Elon Musk at the helm, it looks to have a bright future in a fast-growing market. Knowing this, investors have bid up Tesla's shares to the tune of 787% in the past year. The S&P 500 has risen by a comparatively meager 18% in the same period. The downside to Tesla's stellar gains, though, is that its stock now looks overvalued. The company is trading at 1,130 times past and 232 times future earnings, and boasts a market cap of about $405 billion. At those levels, many years of success are already factored into Tesla's share price. As such, investors today might be better served to look elsewhere for growth stocks. One in particular that is worth your attention is Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG). Here's why the healthcare giant is a better growth buy than Tesla right now. TSLA data by YChartsIntuitive is best known for its da Vinci surgical system, the leading robotic-assisted surgery device. It enables surgeons to conduct minimally invasive surgeries, performed through small incisions using laparoscopic cameras and smaller instruments. Such surgeries offer several advantages over traditional operations, including less bleeding, less pain, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery times. Those benefits explain the da Vinci's popularity, and why it looks to have a long growth path ahead.  Further, medical device giant Medtronic estimates that only 2% of surgeries worldwide are performed using robotic-assisted devices. Because of these factors (and others), we can expect the market for such systems will grow rapidly in the coming years. Research firm Grand View Research thinks it will be worth $8.24 billion in revenue by 2025, up from $2.9 billion in 2020.It's worth noting that robotic-assisted surgical devices aren't cheap -- Intuitive Surgical's da Vincis cost between half a million dollars and $2.5 million.Image source: Getty Images.Not all healthcare facilities can afford that price tag, but the company does offer leasing arrangements, so hospitals can acquire the device without laying out the entire cost up front. Intuitive Surgical will be able to attract more customers thanks to this option. At the end of the second quarter, 5,764 da Vinci systems were installed worldwide, up 9% year over year. Expect the number of da Vincis in use to keep growing at a good clip. Even if its industry is on an upward trajectory, investors may question whether Intuitive Surgical will be able to remain the dominant player. One major reason to think it will is that the company has carved out a competitive advantage for itself, which will help it stay ahead of the competition. Launching robotic-assisted surgical devices on the market is no easy task. Just building these complex machines is daunting, and that's only the first step.Companies then have to earn clearance from regulators (the da Vinci system was cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration back in 2000). Following regulatory clearance, companies have to build accompanying instruments, market their products to healthcare facilities, and properly train medical staff to use the machines.Intuitive Surgical has already jumped through these hoops. Competitors hoping to knock the healthcare company off its pedestal will have to do the same before they can catch up. And while its peers fight this uphill battle to make a dent in the industry, Intuitive Surgical will continue to look for ways to strengthen its position in this market. For those reasons, investors can expect this company to remain one of the biggest players in its market for many years to come. Intuitive Surgical isn't a cheap stock either. The company's price-to-earnings ratio is 78, while its forward P/E is 82. But both of those metrics compare favorably to Tesla's. Further, Intuitive Surgical's $86.4 billion market cap is also less than 20% that of the electric-car maker. While both of these companies are leaders in high-growth industries -- and both are worth adding to your portfolio -- at current levels, Intuitive Surgical looks like a much better buy. 10 stocks we like better than Intuitive SurgicalWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It also trimmed the starting price of Model S by 3% in China.

The German firm also plans to make vehicles with Shanghai-based automaker SAIC Motor 600104.SS.Audi said it would produce models based on the Premium Platform Electric (PPE), a base developed with Porsche.

It sold 512,081 vehicles in China in the first nine months of 2020 and about 690,000 vehicles last year.Audi and Porsche's representatives in China said there was no plan for Porsche production at the new venture.EV makers such as home-grown Nio Inc NIO.N and Xpeng Inc XPEV.N as well as foreign firms like U.S. leader Tesla Inc TSLA.O are expanding manufacturing capacity in China where the government promotes greener vehicles to reduce air pollution.(Reporting by Yilei Sun and Brenda Goh; Editing by Louise Heavens and Edmund Blair)((Y.Sun@thomsonreuters.com; +86 10 66271262; Reuters Messaging: y.sun.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\n",

      "Haber:  Tesla’s stock has rallied by about 5x this year, with its current market cap standing at about $400 billion. Can the stock continue to outperform, joining the rarefied group of companies with a $1 trillion market capitalization? It’s possible. Although Tesla stock looks pricey at current levels, if the company executes well and the markets continue to view its prospects favorably, a $1 trillion valuation remains within reach by 2025.Our interactive analysis on Tesla Upside: How Tesla Gets To A $1 Trillion Market Cap provides a detailed breakdown of how Tesla’s value could grow 2.5x by 2025. You can modify key assumptions to arrive at your own valuation for Tesla for the 2025 and 2030 period.Tesla’s Revenue GrowthTesla’s Revenues can grow by 3.7x to levels of about $112 billion in 2025, from an estimated $30 billion in 2020, representing a growth rate of roughly 30% per year. While deliveries are likely to grow to close to 500k units this year, they could possibly stand at about 2.1 million cars by 2025 – a growth rate of about 35% (versus about 56% growth for the 2015 to 2020E period). This is possible considering three trends 1) Tesla is quickly scaling up manufacturing capacity with new factories (Shanghai, upcoming Berlin and Texas) and new models (Model Y, upcoming Cybertruck, and planned lower-end models) 2) Large size of the auto market, favorable regulations, and a lack of a real direct competitor (thus far) in the electric vehicles (EV) and autonomous driving space 3) The Covid-19 led disruption in the auto market could also slow down mainstream automakers’ shift to EVs, giving Tesla an edge. That said, Tesla’s average selling prices could continue to trend lower, to about $48k per vehicle as Tesla produces more mass-market vehicles. This would translate to Automotive Revenue of roughly $102 billion. We also expect Tesla’s Other Revenues (which include Service and Energy) to rise to about $10 billion by 2025, for a total of about $112 billion in Revenue by 2025. Tesla’s Margins & ProfitsCombine revenue growth with the fact that Tesla’s Net Margins (net income, or profits after all expenses and taxes, calculated as a percent of revenues) are on an improving trajectory. They grew from -22% in 2015 to about -1% in 2019 and it’s likely that they will improve to about 6% in 2020, with Net Profits standing at $1.8 billion.  Tesla’s margins could possibly expand to about 17.5% by 2025 (for about $20 billion in Net Profits). How is this possible? As Tesla scales up deliveries and further automates its manufacturing process, fixed cost absorption should improve. Tesla also expects battery costs to decline by over 50% in about 3 years, and this should also help margins considerably. (Tesla Can Post Apple-Like Margins. Here’s How) Thirdly, improving self-driving capabilities should drive software sales further, helping margins. (How Do Tesla’s Software Sales Impact Its Gross Margins?) So is 11x growth in earnings possible in the next five years? Yes. This appears possible when you combine 3.7x revenue growth with the 3x growth that’s possible in Tesla’s margins.Tesla’s ValuationNow if earnings grow 11x, will Tesla’s P/E multiple shrink to 1/11th its current level, keeping its stock price at current levels? Probably not.  If earnings really expand 11x over the next few years, instead of the P/E shrinking from around 220x now to about 20x, a scenario where the P/E metric falls more modestly to about 50x is likely if the markets expect Tesla to continue to post above-average growth rates, with reduced risk. For context, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a P/E of 35x, despite averaging Revenue growth of about 5% over the last 5 years, although its margins stand at over 20%. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) , on the other hand, trades at a P/E based on 2020 earnings of roughly 100x, with Revenue growth averaging 25% and Net Margins of about 4%. With a 50x multiple on a Net Income of about $20 billion in 2025, Tesla could be valued at $1 trillion.What if you’re looking for a more balanced portfolio instead? Here’s a high-quality portfolio to beat the market, with over 100% return since 2016, versus 50% for the S&P 500. Comprised of companies with strong revenue growth, healthy profits, lots of cash, and low risk, it has outperformed the broader market year after year, consistently.See all Trefis Price Estimates and Download Trefis Data hereWhat’s behind Trefis?

Yet in many ways, when the market climbs precipitously -- as we've seen over the past several days -- it can be even harder for investors to handle. That might not seem to make sense, and it wouldn't if everyone followed one simple principle. But market melt-ups reveal the shortcomings of one of the biggest mistakes that many investors make.We've seen huge ups and huge downs throughout 2020, and even though there hasn't been a market crash the size of what we saw in February and March, it's still been staggering to see the pace at which market sentiment can turn. Throughout much of the summer, markets gained ground, with many indexes punching through old highs at the beginning of September.^DJI data by YCharts.That was followed by an abrupt downturn that took most of September. Yet after that correction, markets have moved higher quickly and furiously, with major benchmarks seeing gains of as much as 12% from their lows just a couple of weeks ago. Volatile stocks such as Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) have seen even more dramatic moves in their share prices.The emotional response to a market crash is obvious: fear. It's easy to understand why investors can lose their perspective when they're afraid.Image source: Getty Images.The last thing that you'd think investors would have to deal with during a market melt-up is fear. But fear does play a role here:What's more, investors who make mistakes during big bull moves feel especially exposed. In a market crash, everyone's losing money, so it doesn't feel as bad. But the thought that everyone's making money except for you -- well, that's a tough one for most people to swallow.Just as market crashes teach investors not to take on more risk than they're comfortable with, market melt-ups teach investors not to take on less risk than they're capable of handling. Moreover, just as crashes show the defensive benefits of diversification, melt-ups can reveal that your portfolio doesn't have enough exposure to the parts of the stock market that are performing the best.Handling emotions in investing is always a difficult experience. You won't always get it right. But it's always worth the effort, because there's so much at stake that you can't afford simply to ignore the danger and hope you never fall into the traps that bull market melt-ups pose.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "Haber:  \"Tesla hasn't responded to a press inquiry in months.\" Tuesday's column by professional Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) watcher Electrek opened with what sounded like a complaint -- but was really more of an observation. Citing sources from \"the highest level\" who \"can confirm\" this fact, Electrek proceeded to report that Tesla has officially \"dissolved its PR department,\" and now literally has nobody on staff responding to inquiries from the press.Image source: Getty Images.In part, Tesla's move appears to have happened by accident, but in part, it happened by design. As Electrek notes, former Tesla PR head Keely Sulprizio left Tesla to join the staff at Impossible Foods in December 2019, and senior global communications manager Danielle Meister departed for WhatsApp in April.Other folks who previously handled press inquiries have shifted into new roles within Tesla itself. Senior manager Gina Antonini, for example, is now Tesla's director of external relations and employee experience. Former communications manager Alexander Ingram now works for Tesla's design studio, and PR staffer Rich Otto has become a product manager. Another communications alumnus, Alan Cooper, first switched departments in February -- then left the company entirely.Still, you'd think that if Tesla were interested in talking to the press, it would have little difficulty finding replacements -- but apparently, Tesla is in fact not interested. Electrek notes that Tesla CEO Elon Musk complains often about Tesla's treatment in the press. Now, it appears he's decided to simply cut off contact with the media entirely.So how people supposed to ask Tesla questions when they have them nowadays? Well, according to the website at least, Tesla still has an email address for press inquiries: Press@Tesla.com, and a separate address for investor queries: IR@Tesla.com.If you've ever got questions for Tesla, drop them a line. And cross your fingers.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "Haber:  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips2020 is the year of the special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs). And another new entrant to the field, SwitchBack Energy Acquisition (NYSE:SBE), is garnering attention. It makes perfect sense why. Unlike so many SPACs, SwitchBack is buying a company, ChargePoint, which has an already-proven product and more than $100 million in annual revenues.ChargePoint seeks to revolutionize the electric vehicle (EV) industry by making vehicle charging a painless, hassle-free experience. So far, its plan seems to be working.Traders are buying into the story as well; SwitchBack’s shares have surged 32% over the past month. However, it’s worth looking at the fine print before placing a buy order.What is ChargePoint’s value proposition? Simply put, the company wants to build the hardware that can replace gas stations. Large dedicated charging stations for electric vehicles haven’t necessarily been a great market fit.So ChargePoint is trying things a different way. It sells little charging units that you can set up next to each parking space (like parking meters, only for energy). ChargePoint doesn’t buy or sell electricity or deal with grid management or that stuff. It simply provides the charging unit and the software to operate it. The host — such as an employer who puts these units in their parking lot for employees — is then responsible for the electricity and choosing whether end users pay for it or not.ChargePoint intends to build a large recurring revenue business. By getting its units installed in parking lots and side streets around the nation, it can get a big base. Then it gets to charge a monthly fee for keeping them operating. Needless to say, this could be a huge business if EV adoption is anywhere close to projections.It’s easy to make a breezy bull case for this sort of stock. Electric vehicles are the wave of the future. Thus, isn’t charging technology an inevitable way to play the trend? A stock like this practically sells itself just listening to the story.Once you dig in deeper, however, there are a number of glaring issues that emerge. For one, the company is barely getting started. It shipped 32,000 units last year, and generated $147 million of revenues in 2019. Both figures are actually set to decline in 2020 because of the pandemic. The company projects 60% growth annually indefinitely after this bump, but based on the company’s past modest results, this seems excessive.The valuation, in light of the above figures, is shocking. At the $10 SPAC deal price, SBE was trading for a $3 billion valuation once the deal closes. With shares at $15, this figure has gone up even more. I know we’re in a market where valuation doesn’t matter, but $3 billion+ for $147 million of annual revenues at fairly modest gross margins is still something else.That’s far from the only issue. In fact, if you turn to page 37 of their Sept. 23 slide deck, you find a true stunner.ChargePoint lays out a comparable analysis deck of companies it perceives as similar to itself. Some of these comparables, like solar power companies, make sense. Some are a stretch — Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is quite a different beast than ChargePoint, and it’s pretty bold to claim Musk’s empire as a peer business.However, the real shocker is Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON). In what universe is ChargePoint a comparable company to Peloton? How can you possibly say a fitness company and a car-charging start-up are peers? Needless to say, if you use that much latitude to select your comparable companies, you can flatter yourself in the ensuing analysis.Even after those carefully-selected peers, there’s more. That’s because — get this — ChargePoint uses 2021 earnings for Tesla, Peloton and other peers and compares them to 2026 project results for Chargepoint. 2026! Of course your stock is going to look cheap if you pencil in five years of incredible growth for yourself while your peers are busy using today’s numbers while fending off a pandemic.A company running a traditional initial public offering (IPO) would not use this brazen of marketing tactics. The Securities and Exchange Commission regulates forward guidance on IPOs pretty heavily, and besides, investment banks don’t want to be the butt of jokes if their underwritten companies fail to perform.SPACs, however, are the wild west. Regulation hardly exists, and the companies going public can use just about any old trick to make the numbers sparkle. If that includes a nonsensical line-up of “peers” and imagined numbers from the year 2026, why not? With SPACs, it’s all fine.As such, it’s caveat emptor; buyer beware with all SPACs, especially this one. I don’t hate the business model, but the valuation is stretched and the marketing is overly aggressive. There are also competitive risks. ChargePoint is far from the only charging company out there. And future innovations, such as wireless charging, could make this line of business obsolete in the years to come.This is a promising company. However, the valuation now is totally detached from anything realistic. Furthermore, management is really putting the best possible spin on its numbers and competitive market position. Once the shine wears off, expect share to trade at a more reasonable price.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Ian Bezek has written more than 1,000 articles for InvestorPlace.com and Seeking Alpha.

      "Haber:  Value traps are companies that may seem cheap at first glance, but get progressively cheaper and cheaper until their stock destroys all the wealth investors can put into them. Such phenomena are quite common for companies that enduring considerable declines in their core operations, or are cooking their books to make their business look more attractive. From a company that fabricated its financials, to another that's embroiled in insider trading controversy, to another that faces allegations that its technology is non-existent, the stocks all have one thing in common: having fallen from great heights and appearing deceptively undervalued. Let's look at why these companies are value traps and why investors should avoid them. Image source: Getty Images.Luckin Coffee (OTC: LKNC.Y) had high hopes of disrupting the Chinese coffee industry. Founded in 2017, the company began on a journey of rapid expansion across China, opening nearly 5,000 stores across the country by the end of 2019, eclipsing Starbucks' goal of opening 6,000 stores in the Middle Kingdom by the end of 2022. However, that dream came crashing down in April as an internal review of its financials found its COO had fabricated at least $310 million of its $732 million in revenue last year. In addition, short-seller Muddy Waters conducted an independent investigation of the company that found it relied on mass distribution of free coffee coupons for the sake of growth. At one point in time, Luckin Coffee allegedly gave nearly half of its coffee for free to solicit new customers, while its core members received no such perks for their loyalty. The Nasdaq stock exchange has delisted the stock for failing to file its financial statements since the third quarter of 2019. Since its all-time high in April, the stock is now down over 90%. For investors who find it tempting to buy the dip, however, there are many reasons to stay away from the stock. Most crucially, it is simply not the cultural norm for people to drink coffee in China, where the average Chinese person only drinks 0.014 cups of coffee per day. That's astonishingly low compared to the 1.1 cups of coffee the average American drinks on a daily basis. Keep in mind, the reason behind the company fabricating its financials was to \"demonstrate\" that it had the potential to outcompete Starbucks. Now that the house of cards has come crumbling down, it is difficult to see how Luckin coffee can generate genuine consumer traffic at thousands of its stores. With so many players in a hypercompetitive market, the worst is probably yet to come for Luckin coffee. In late July, shares of digital camera company Eastman Kodak (NYSE: KODK) looked like they were finally about to turn around seven years of underperformance, with the announcement that the Department of Defense (DoD) will be awarding the company a $765 million loan for it to manufacture generic drug ingredients. Fast forward three months later, and Kodak stock is once again going through tough times, after allegations of rampant insider trading in anticipation of the deal announcement and questionable tax avoidance tactics by one of its board members forced the DoD to halt the deal. In September, a law firm hired by Kodak cleared the company of any wrongdoing, which ironically brings up a new problem of conflict of interest rather than inspire confidence. The company is still pending outcomes of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Even if the company miraculously gets the loan back, take note that it's still a loan as opposed to an equity investment. The generic drug sector is already highly saturated as it is. Suppose Kodak invests hundreds of millions in new manufacturing facilities and sees little return on investment. In that case, it has little chance of paying back the DoD, as a $765 million debt is almost 64 times the size of Kodak's annual cash flow. Unfortunately, the advent of smartphones is rapidly rendering digital cameras archaic, as well as squeezing out traditional photo printing services. During the second quarter of 2020, Eastman Kodak's revenue decreased from $307 million in second quarter 2019 to $213 million, while its non-cash operating loss (EBITDA) increased from $1 million to $7 million over the same time period. The stock is now down nearly 85% from its high of $60 per share in July. At one point in time, electric car company Nikola's (NASDAQ: NKLA) market cap soared to as much as $34 billion after it disclosed that it discovered a breakthrough in vehicle battery technology. Unlike its competitor Tesla Motors, however, Nikola did not disclose the chemical composition of its supposed battery, nor any information about which university it partnered with to develop the technology. With the help of short-selling firm Hindenburg Research digging through some financials in September, it turned out that Nikola made its breakthrough claim days before it signed a letter-of-intent to acquire car battery start-up ZapGo, who in turn boasted that they had developed a groundbreaking carbon-ion battery that is significantly more energy efficient than commercially available variants. Before the acquisition could go through, ZapGo's President of U.S. Operations resigned over prostitution and tax fraud allegations. The two companies are now embroiled in a lawsuit with Nikola alleging ZapGo made false or misleading statements regarding its technology. ZapGo took the initial steps to declaring insolvency in July, which is highly uncanny for a company possessing a major technological advancement. We will not know for sure until after the fact whether or not Nikola actually has the capacity to deliver its promise on a revolutionary battery. The odds, however, are not good. According to General Motors employees who have witnessed Nikola's operations, the company's battery and fuel technology were inferior to that of General Motors'. Both the SEC and the Department of Justice are investing allegations of misconduct against Nikola. If drowning in controversy isn't enough, Nikola's financials are also nothing to be excited about. In the second quarter of 2020, the company generated just $36k in revenue, compared to a stunning net loss of $100 million. That's mind-boggling for a company with a market cap of $9 billion. In just four months, shares are down over 70% from its high in June. 10 stocks we like better than Eastman KodakWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "Haber:  After both Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) split their stocks last month, investors rightly wondered whether another high-flying stock, Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN), would also split its shares.After all, with its shares at over $3,100 apiece, now would seem an opportune time to jump on the bandwagon. But I don't think Amazon will. Despite having split its shares three times in the past, the situation today is much different, and it appears Amazon is happy to remain a high-priced stock.Image source: Amazon.com.It's been more than 20 years since Amazon divvied its shares to make them more attractive to investors, and the e-commerce giant was still relatively new to the public markets back then.Amazon's initial public offering was in May 1997. A year later, the company split its stock 2-for-1, when it was trading at only $85 per share and it had a market cap of less than $5 billion. Just seven months later, it split again 3-for-1, after the shares had rocketed to $355 a piece. Eight months after that, in September 1999, it split for the third and last time, 2-for-1, when the stock was trading under $120 each.Since then, Amazon has been on an astronomical tear. In the 21 years that followed, the stock has risen by more than 5,200%, compared with a 158% gain for the S&P 500. And its market cap has increased from $20 billion to almost $1.6 trillion, a 7,800% expansion, for a compounded annual growth rate of 23%.AMZN data by YChartsAn investor would be hard put to find a better performing stock, yet over the past two decades as Amazon's business has both grown and improved, and its stock continued to climb into the stratosphere, the e-commerce giant has chosen not to split its stock again.Amazon was a much different company the last time it split its stock. Still primarily the \"world's biggest bookseller,\" in 1999 Amazon had only recently expanded into selling music CDs, and it was just adding a few more categories to its selection, including, toys, electronics, and tools. By December of that year, the e-commerce company had shipped a total of 20 million items,  and it generated total revenue of just over $1.6 billion.To put that into perspective, during its annual Prime Day shopping extravaganza event last year, Amazon sold over 175 million products. For the full year, Amazon had $280.5 billion in sales, meaning it took just the first two days of 2019 for its revenue to match the entire year's worth of sales in 1999. Of course, the Amazon of today is more than just books, toys, electronics, or tools, and you can find just about anything you want to buy on the website.But it's also just more than about e-commerce. While shipping its products keeps the U.S. Postal Service operational, Amazon Web Services (AWS) generated $35 billion in sales, or about 12% of the total, yet represented 63% of Amazon's $14.5 billion in operating profit.AWS has become the backbone for the online platforms of numerous other retailers and businesses, including the U.S. government. It controls a market-leading 31% share of cloud services, followed by Microsoft Azure at 20%, Alphabet's Google Cloud with 6%, and Alibaba at 5%.Amazon also has its own fleet of delivery cars and vans, its own fleet of airplanes and trucks, even container ships. It also operates more than 175 operating fulfillment centers and more than 150 million square feet of space to ship products.Because Amazon encompasses far more than simply a consumer-facing business, even if that's what it's most recognized as, it doesn't need to make itself accessible to retail investors anymore.In 1999, Amazon was trying to make its mark against Barnes & Noble, but today it's involved in almost every segment of the economy. Its products and services are literally almost too numerous to mention, which means it can be complacent about being available only to most retail investors as a fractional investment through services like Robinhood and WeBull.A split doesn't really matter to an investor anyway, as that investor's stake in the company remains the same. It all depends upon whether you like your pizza cut into eight slices or 16 -- it doesn't change the size of your pie.Still, after 20 years and thousands of percentage-point increases later, it's safe to say Amazon.com won't be splitting its stock anytime soon -- though that doesn't mean its stock isn't still a buy.10 stocks we like better than AmazonWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "Haber:  Tuesday brought a pause to the stock market's recent advance, as investors tried to determine how to balance all the conflicting dynamics affecting the financial markets. Rising long-term interest rates signaled greater belief that the U.S. government would succeed in providing more economic support to Americans, but definitive agreements weren't forthcoming.Just before 11:30 a.m. EDT today, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) was higher by just 9 points to 28,157. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) had lost 7 points to 3,401, and the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) had fallen 68 points to 11,264.Even with the upward momentum in the broader market starting to wane, there are still pockets of strength. One remains technology, with Alteryx (NYSE: AYX) leading the charge higher Tuesday. Elsewhere, the mining space has perked up, especially with smaller companies like Piedmont Lithium (NASDAQ: PLL) seeking to provide valuable minerals for battery technology.Image source: Getty Images.Shares of Alteryx soared 26% on Tuesday morning. The data analytics provider made a major leadership announcement and provided some guidance on its future results.Alteryx announced that it expects revenue for the third quarter to be $126 million to $128 million. That would represent growth of 22% to 24% from year-earlier levels. More importantly, it was far above the initial guidance of $111 million to $115 million that Alteryx had issued previously.The company also said that it has brought on a new executive. Mark Anderson will take over as CEO from co-founder Dean Stoecker, who will stay on as chair of the Alteryx board of directors. Anderson has served on the board for a couple of years now, and Stoecker expressed his confidence in him as \"the ideal candidate to serve as Alteryx's next CEO.\"The stock took a tumble earlier this year as investors called into question whether the data analytics company would be able to sustain its former pace of growth. Today's news suggests that those concerns were unjustified, and new leadership could bring new accomplishments for Alteryx.Elsewhere, Piedmont Lithium climbed 23%, adding to gains from earlier in the week. The lithium mining upstart has gotten a lot of notoriety from a recent supply contract, and forces in the battery materials industry are helping support the share price today.Piedmont was relatively unknown until Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) signed a five-year contract with the company to buy high-grade lithium ore from Piedmont's proposed North Carolina mining and refining project. At that point, the miner came onto investors' radar.Also helping is a recent executive order from the White House identifying other battery-making materials as essential minerals vital to U.S. interests. Although lithium wasn't included in the executive order's list, it stands to benefit from greater attention to other minerals used in battery production.The deal still involves plenty of uncertainty. Piedmont is far from beginning operations, and the agreement will require both parties to figure out more specifics about a start date between mid-2022 and mid-2023. If Piedmont can't get everything up and running by then, Tesla would have the right to undo the agreement -- and presumably all of the mining stock's gains would be for naught.10 stocks we like better than AlteryxWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Somehow, I suspected that the company would remain in hyper-growth mode for a while longer.Amazingly, on Oct. 2, the Nio stock price closed at an eye-popping $21.18. While I projected some share-price growth, I won’t claim to have known in June that the stock would catapult above by early October.The available data certainly paints a picture of a fast-developing electric vehicle manufacturer. As a result, I wouldn’t recommend attempting to short-sell Nio stock. That would just be foolhardy as the share price could keep on moving higher based on market hype and enthusiasm.As for prospective long-side investors, there’s no going back now. We can’t turn back the clock and buy Nio stock at $5 or even $10. All we can do is assess whether the risk-versus-reward profile is favorable at this point. This, then, will require some technical analysis.Even though Nio stock shed 2.67% on Oct. 2, the share price still remained up a heart-pounding 427% on a year-to-date basis. This makes the share-price surge I wrote about in June seem quaint in comparison.With that, Nio stock didn’t only achieve its 52-week high in October. It reached its all-time high, far exceeding any price point in the stock’s history.That might be exciting for traders who prefer to focus on momentum. On the other hand, the melt-up in the Nio stock price may cause concern among contrarians and investors who prefer value over exuberance.And indeed, it’s difficult to find deep value in Nio stock at the moment. If you can believe it, the stock’s trailing 12-month earnings per share is -$44.10. That’s on a stock which trades at $21 and change. It’s probably not a good sign.On the other side of the coin is Nio’s recent performance, not as a stock but as a company. Viewing things from that angle, the argument turns decidedly bullish.The company’s improvement can best be expressed through Nio’s freshly released automobile delivery figures. In particular, for the month of September, Nio delivered 4,708 vehicles. That signifies a 133.2% increase on a year-over-year basis.Moreover, Nio delivered 12,206 vehicles during the third quarter of 2020. That represents a 154.3% year-over-year improvement. It’s also above the higher end of Nio’s guidance for the third quarter.The impressive growth in Nio’s vehicle deliveries was likely a factor in Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu’s decision to reiterate his “buy” rating on Nio stock. Along with that, Yu maintained his upbeat price target of $24.Even with the optimistic rating and price target on Nio stock, Yu seems to concede that the company continues to face stiff competition from its peers.“The main push back we received on our bullish view is NIO’s brand does not create the same level of excitement and loyalty in China that Tesla or the German luxury auto makers command,” commented Yu.He’s making an important point there. As noteworthy as Nio’s improvement has been, the company simply doesn’t have the scale, the capital or the name recognition of electric vehicle behemoth Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).Indeed, I would suspect that the Nio stock price has gotten ahead of itself because some shareholders are wagering that Nio will be the next Tesla. Yet, this might or might not happen.Nio is still a tiny company. Compared to the performance of some other automakers, 12,206 vehicle deliveries during a full quarter is small potatoes. Nonetheless, long-side traders have bid the share price up to the high heavens based on the assumption that Nio’s growth will continue on its current trajectory.As an automaker in hyper-growth mode, Nio might live up to traders’ expectations and continue to deliver more record-setting quarters.However, that assumption of success has, I believe, largely been priced into Nio stock already. I’m still rooting for the company to succeed, but value-focused investors should wait for the share price to come back down to earth before jumping into the trade.On the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.The post Now That Everybody Loves Nio, It’s Time to Start Taking Profits appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\n",

His tweets about new features or future technology are reshared widely on other Twitter accounts and websites.Tesla also employs a sales strategy through which it bypasses dealerships and sells directly to consumers.The company's media relations teams for its European and Asian markets remain in place, the Electrek report said.

      "Haber:  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInterested investors have undoubtedly heard of SPAC offerings. This investment vehicle has hit Wall Street and garnered big-time attention among investors. As a result, Spartan Energy Acquisition (NYSE:SPAQ) has also caught investors’ attention. Shares of Spartan Energy Acquisition erupted higher in June. Of course, that was around when shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Nio (NYSE:NIO), Workhorse (NASDAQ:WKHS) and Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) were ripping higher, too. I mean, Tesla garnered a market capitalization of $475 billion at one point in the run. Of course, there’s the consideration of how others have succeeded in going public via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). In the same electric vehicle (EV) space is Nikola and Workhorse, which both came public via a SPAC offering. While Nikola has had plenty of drama lately, its success in making it to the public markets is noteworthy. Then there are other successful plays like Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) and DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG), which both went public via SPAC offerings. So what exactly is Spartan Energy Acquisition?As Tezcan Gecgil wrote in August, “Spartan had initially agreed with Fisker, a relatively recent addition to the world of electric vehicle (EV) makers, on a reverse merger. The initial date was set for Aug. 14. However, that date has now been delayed to Feb. 14, 2021.”In short, what is Spartan Energy Acquisition? It is essentially Fisker. The EV space has been red-hot in 2020 with investors pouring resources into these names. Personally, I don’t get it. Short of Nio and Tesla, many of these businesses don’t even have revenues. It was absurd to me that Nikola had achieved a higher market cap than Ford (NYSE:F) at one point, without any sales. Heck, the company hasn’t even completed its production facility yet. How can it be worth more than a well-established automaker? As a result, there is both opportunity and risk with Spartan Energy Acquisition. On the one hand, there is the possibility that investors stick with the EV enthusiasm. Again, I don’t get it, but my opinion doesn’t matter. I love Tesla’s cars, but I do not think the company is worth $400 billion at this point. But that doesn’t mean investors won’t bid it up to a $500 billion valuation and take its peers higher, too. On the flip side, Spartan Energy Acquisition faces multiple risks. First, there has been a flood of SPAC offerings. It’s very possible the market gets “SPAC-ed out” and these names struggle in the future. It’s also possible that investors start paying attention to the fundamentals. Nikola and Workhorse have generous valuations despite lacking fundamentals. If that’s the case, newcomers to the space may struggle. At least Tesla is the global EV leader and at least Nio has momentum on its side. Finally, there’s the whole Nikola debacle. After being called a fraud, the company is under the microscope. The SEC is investigating it, the stock is getting hit, and despite the recent good news on a partnership with General Motors (NYSE:GM), GM is seemingly second-guessing the company it saddled up with. Will this cause traditional automakers to be leery of Spartan Energy Acquisition? It’s certainly possible. Early in this article, I referenced the “explosion” higher in the share price. Shares of Spartan Energy Acquisition almost doubled in just a couple of days in June. However, that rally soon fizzled out. In mid-September, shares again caught a whiff of momentum. However, Spartan Energy Acquisition wasn’t able to take out its June highs, securing a lower high in the process. Near the end of the month, the stock repeated the pattern, allowing a downtrend resistance line to form (purple line). At the same time, the 50-day moving average and uptrend support (blue line) continue to hold. The stock is sending mixed signals, but we can use levels to help guide us. On the upside, a close above $15 puts shares back above the 20-day moving average and downtrend resistance. That opens the door to a rally back toward $17.50 and the September high up at $18.24.On the downside, a close below the 50-day moving average and uptrend support puts the September low in play at $12.52. In fact, this was a double-bottom low, hit on Sept. 4 and Sept. 24. A close below this mark likely puts the 200-day moving average on the table. On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.The post What Is Spartan Energy Acquisition and Is It a Buy? appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\n",

      "Haber:  By Jeff LewisTORONTO, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Brazilian miner Vale SA VALE3.SA is in talks with Tesla TSLA.O and others in the electric vehicle (EV) supply chain about securing nickel from its Canadian operations, the head of the miner's base metals unit said on Friday.Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Tesla CEO Elon Musk in July urged miners to produce more nickel, a key ingredient in the batteries that power the company's electric cars. Musk offered a \"giant contract\" if supplies could be produced in an environmentally sensitive way. While EVs are expected to help reduce global carbon emission, environmentalists are concerned that production of EV parts and increased mining may damage the environment.Analysts have also warned of a supply deficit for nickel, which makes batteries energy dense so cars can run further on a single charge.Tesla and other automakers need to ensure there is sufficient nickel available to produce the number of batteries required for EVs over the next five to eight years, Mark Travers, Vale's executive director of base metals, told Reuters.\"So that is the nature of the discussions I’m sure that is occurring across the industry right now and, without specifically commenting on Tesla, those are the conversations we are having right now,” he said.Asked whether Vale and Tesla have held discussions, Travers said: \"Yes, absolutely.\"Vale, whose Canadian operations span three provinces, is in the midst of expanding its Voisey's Bay site to an underground operation that will produce about 40,000 tonnes of nickel-in-concentrate per year.The miner has dedicated about $2 billion to low-carbon projects across its base metals unit, including electrification of underground vehicles, fuel switching and heat recovery, Travers said.In Canada it is also studying potential to store carbon in tailings at its operations in Thompson, Manitoba, he said.Such considerations are \"a key focal point\" in discussions with automakers and other EV participants, he said.\"The discussions around environmentally friendly nickel are front and center,” he said.(Reporting by Jeff Lewis; editing by Grant McCool)((Jeff.Lewis@thomsonreuters.com; +1 647 200 7236))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\n",

      "Haber:  Just three months ago, car manufacturer Nikola Motors (NASDAQ: NKLA) was being lauded for pushing the limits of the auto industry, and its stock soared following its IPO. Then came the bad news. And more bad news. And more. Today, the troubles have hit like a hurricane, and with every day that passes, the bricks come tumbling down faster. What caused Nikola's fall from grace? And how did it happen so fast?Nikola's current misery traces back to a September fraud allegation, in which Hindenburg Research asserted that the electric semi Nikola One truck was, in fact, an \"elaborate ruse.\"Â Further, the research firm described Nikola's proprietary battery technology -- which some predicted would revolutionize the industry -- as \"vaporware.\" Image source: NikolaHindenburg Research was short  Nikola stock prior to the release of the report, and Nikola claims that Hindenburg timed the release to benefit from the stock price surge after its General Motors partnership announcement.Â How valid are the accusations in the Hindenburg report? Can investors  trust the short-seller's research?Hindenburg has already benefited from the more than 30% plunge in Nikola's stock price, but investors do not have to take Hindenburg for its word along. Nikola itself issued a statement commenting on the report, and in it, the company fails to deny many of the allegations lodged against it.Â The big red flag: Nikola released a January 2018 promotional video of its 2016 hydrogen-electric powered semi-truck that makes it appear like the truck is cruising down the highway. In fact, the semi was actually rolling down a hill without power. Hindenburg claims the semi-truck was a non-functioning prototype. Nikola, however, sidestepped the issue, explaining that the Nikola One semi was originally designed to run on its own. Then, the company scrapped the project to design a second generation of its prototype vehicle.Nikola's non-answer sounds like a very weak excuse to investors who once saw it as the next Tesla.Â Instead of attempting to debunk the claims, Nikola claimed that Hindenburg Research had misconstrued the truth. The company's \"refutation\" of the short-seller's claims essentially states that:Nevertheless, nothing in Nikola's press release seems to do much to support the assertion that Hindenburg's claims were false. Even if  electric vehicle company never claimed to have a working prototype built using in-house components, many of its investors seemed to think that way and the company did not appear to be working diligently to correct any misconceptions.  Investors began jumping ship after the allegations came to light.If that wasn't bad enough, Nikola CEO Trevor Milton resigned effective Sept. 20, less than two weeks after the report was published. In addition, a reported deal between energy giant BP and Nikola has fallen apart.Â Image source: Getty ImagesNikola was once applauded as a revolutionary company in the auto industry. Now, there seems to be some confusion about whether it can truthfully make that claim.Â According to a Financial Times report, the Department of Justice has launched a probe into Nikola in response to Hindenburg's claims, and the Securities and Exchange Commission has also begun its own investigation. However, at the end of September, the company's management reaffirmed their commitment to producing the 100% electric-battery Nikola Tre truck, slated for customer availability in the fourth quarter of 2021. It also aims to create a hydrogen-fueled prototype of medium- and long-haul trucks that should be ready for testing by the end of 2021. Additionally, Nikola's newly-announced partner General Motors pledged to continue supporting the embattled automotive company. It has stated that it intends to sell its own hydrogen and battery systems to Nikola while engineering and building the company's Badger pick-up truck for the U.S. market. Indeed,  that GM plans to build its own clean-energy vehicle line may prove to be the only boon left to Nikola. Regardless of its previous murky claims, the fact that a well-established car manufacturer intends to produce a Nikola-conceptualized vehicle (albeit using GM systems, engineering, and production lines) means that the upstart could actually manage to sell a working vehicle one day.Â 10 stocks we like better than Nikola CorporationWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "Haber:  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA poor jobs report and news that President Donald Trump has tested positive for Covid-19 weighed on the stock market on Friday. With that in mind, let’s get to some top stock trades in the meantime. Nio (NYSE:NIO) reported solid third-quarter delivery results on Friday, but you wouldn’t know it by the stock’s reaction. Same with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).However, unlike Tesla, Nio stock isn’t wavering as much. In fact, the stock is holding up near its prior breakout level.In late August and early September, Nio stock was rejected by the $21 level. It didn’t help that the company raised additional funds and the stock market took a solid dip (as did Tesla).However, Nio never broke stride, as uptrend support continued to hold (blue line). This week, shares were able to breakout over $21 and hit the 161.8% extension (for the entire range).Let’s see if the stock can continue to hold up over the 10-day moving average. If it can, it will keep bulls looking for a move over $22.59, the current all-time high. Above that could trigger a rally to the two-times range extension all the way up near $26.40.On the downside, a break of the 10-day moving average puts uptrend support and the 50-day moving average in play.Earlier this week, Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) reported a much better-than-expected earnings result. Now, shares are ramping higher on the week, up more than 40%.The stock is reclaiming a vital mark near $17.50, as well as the declining 200-week moving average. I know it’s quite the rally, but as long as shares are over $17.50, I find it hard to be bearish.Plus, this stock had a short interest north of 60%. That puts the potential for a massive short squeeze higher on the table. If BBBY can rally further, look to see if it can extend up to the 138.2% and 161.8% extensions at $22.73 and $26.02, respectively.American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) is trying to get some upside momentum going. Shares are struggling with the 10-day, 20-day and 50-day moving averages.If AAL can gain momentum over these marks, it puts $14 resistance in play. Above $14 could really get the group moving, potentially putting the 200-day moving average on the table.The $14 level was resistance in June. Above that and the 38.2% retracement is possible.On the downside, a break of this week’s low at $12 could put recent range support on the table near $11. If the stock gets there and it holds as support, it’s more wait-and-see trading from AAL as it remains rangebound.A close below $11 support is more bearish, though.Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) has a great-looking chart right here.The stock exploded higher on Monday, rallying about 25%. And all week the stock has been forming this nice-looking bull flag.That action comes as the 50-day moving average continues to hold as support and as the 10-day moving average finally catches up to the stock.Now what?I want to see a rotation over this week’s high at $20.98 and longer-term resistance at $21. Above that could get a quick move to the 38.2% retracement, up at $21.83.From there we’ll need to see how SPCE stock is trading. However, above this level could open the door to the 50% retracement at $25.78. It also puts the $26 to $27.50 area on the table, which came into play near the July highs.On the downside, a break of the 200-day moving average — which was solid support until September — would be very damaging to the bull case in the short term. It could put a gap-fill in play toward $16.50, followed by support at $15.On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.The post 4 Top Stock Trades for Monday: NIO, BBBY, AAL, SPCE appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\n",

      "Haber:  By David RandallNEW YORK, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Investors on Wall Street can add another layer of uncertainty to a market already unnerved by last month's sell-off, stalled fiscal stimulus and President Donald Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis, which weighed on stocks on Friday.     A higher capital gains tax that could accompany a win by Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is also emerging as a potential counterweight to this year's powerful rally in stocks.Biden has proposed taxing capital gains and dividends as ordinary income, which would increase the tax rate from 20% to 39.6% for individuals and couples earning over $1 million, the highest tax bracket.That policy - which would likely be easier to enact if Democrats also win the Senate and retain control of the House - may push some investors to lock in gains ahead of December if Biden emerges the winner in the Nov. 3 vote, fund managers said.Tax-motivated selling would likely be most pronounced in technology and other momentum stocks and could push the broad S&P 500 index lower between November and the end of the year, said Eddie Perkin, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance.\"If you have enough people looking to harvest gains, that has an impact on the stocks that have led the market, and the big tech stocks could be where people choose to sell at the end of the year,\" he said.On Friday, President Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis triggered a sell-off in stocks and oil as investors moved away from risk assets.  But many tech and momentum stocks are sporting healthy gains for the year despite a sell-off that pushed the S&P 500 down 3.9% in September, its first monthly loss since March.Tesla Inc TSLA.O, for instance, is up 436% for the year through Friday, while Zoom Video Communications Inc ZM.O is up 610% and Amazon.com Inc is up 74%. The S&P 500 index as a whole is up 3.8% over the same time.That kind of momentum may be difficult to slow, especially if it is aided by seasonal trends. November and December tend to be among the best months for stock performance, boasting an average gain of 1.34% and 1.57%, respectively, for the S&P 500, according to research firm CFRA.\"The third quarter is usually weak, but when it is really strong, like it was in 2020, this says the rally isn’t over yet,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.Still, some believe a Biden victory would provide a strong incentive for profit-taking. SELLING 'AHEAD OF SCHEDULE'Chris Cordaro, chief investment officer of RegentAtlantic, believes a broad Democratic victory will likely lead to more stock market volatility as soon as the results of the election are known as investors start selling winners.He has been counseling some clients to generate more income this year as opposed to in 2021, by taking money out of retirement accounts, which would add another layer of selling, he said.\"You're going to see people selling things that they would be selling anyway, but ahead of schedule,\" he said.Investors in the coming week will be keeping an eye on minutes from the Federal Reserve's most recent monetary policy meeting, due out Wednesday, for insight on how the central bank views the nascent recovery in the United States. Higher taxes do not always lead to increased selling. Overall, the capital gains tax rate could go as high as 40% before having widespread effects on investor behavior and discouraging investment, according to a paper by Princeton University economics professors Owen Zidar and Ole Agersnap.Personal income tax rates are more likely to affect the market's winners this year, Cordaro said, while increased corporate taxes would most likely lower valuations across the stock market over the next year.By 2024, however, enactment of Biden's proposed tax measures and other policies would cut just 4% off of estimated earnings for the S&P 500 compared with baseline estimates, according to Goldman Sachs.Increasing corporate taxes while the global economy is still trying to recover from the coronavirus pandemic could dent the rally in the stock market and cut into company plans to hire or invest in new projects by eating into after-tax net income, saidhedge fund manager J. Daniel Plants, who runs Voce Capital Management.\"History teaches us that this is the worst possible moment to subject the economy to the type of massive tax increases that Biden is proposing, especially the changes that would impede capital formation and make domestic job creation less attractive,\" he said.(Reporting by David Randall.

      "Haber:  The stock market had a tough day on Friday, and the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) suffered the brunt of the downdraft. Concerns about news that President Trump and other prominent officials in the administration have tested positive for COVID-19 were enough to take the air out of the rally earlier this week. The Nasdaq ended up losing more than 2% on the day.The most prominent stocks in the Nasdaq have been among the best performers recently, and both Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) have made solid contributions to the bull market. On Friday, though, both finished sharply lower. Here's why.Tesla shares finished down more than 7% on Friday, giving up all their gains from earlier in the week. The automaker released its much-anticipated delivery numbers for the third quarter, and given how good they were, it's somewhat surprising to see the stock fall in response.Tesla's Semi. Image source: Tesla.Tesla reported that it delivered 139,300 vehicles during the third quarter. That included 124,100 Model 3 and Y units, along with 15,200 Model S and X vehicles. Production figures were slightly higher, with Tesla making more than 128,000 Model 3s and Ys and almost 17,000 Model S and X units for a total of 145,036.The delivery numbers were the best in Tesla's history, and they were also better than what most of those following the stock had anticipated. Nevertheless, the company has done a good job in the past of wildly surpassing expectations, and it's possible that its failure to do so this time around was enough to pull down the high-flying auto stock.Yet to keep some perspective, Tesla's value is still double what it was as recently as late June. For long-term investors, it's hard to treat small one-day drops like this as a big deal.Elsewhere, Netflix shares lost almost 5% of their value on Friday. Having faced some pushback on a controversial new release, the streaming video giant might have seen more customers leave than normal.Analysts at Bank of America's securities division didn't make any changes to their overall views on Netflix stock, keeping their buy rating and maintaining the $575 per share price target they've put on the video entertainment provider. However, BofA did note that industry data shows a slightly higher churn rate for September than Netflix had earlier in the summer. It attributed part of that churn to Cuties, which has gotten criticism for its initial promotional poster and the trailer's depiction of the content of the series.In addition, downloads of Netflix software have dropped lately. Competition from other streaming services has only increased recently, and the return of some popular forms of content, including sports, is also putting pressure on Netflix.It was always going to be hard for Netflix to sustain the pace of growth it enjoyed at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. What remains to be seen, though, is whether the company can maintain a good balance between making the most it can from its pioneering video streaming service and ensuring that customers get the content they want at a price they're willing to pay.10 stocks we like better than NetflixWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "Haber:  Penny stocks are stocks that trade below $5 a share. They're much riskier investments for a number of reasons, including the fact that most companies with such cheap shares are untested and make limited public information available.Unfortunately, they used to be the only option for investors without big pocketbooks. That's because brokers charged commissions to buy stocks and limited you to buying full shares. Things have changed now though, and big-name companies such as Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are penny stocks now. And that's not because these two innovative industry leaders recently split their stocks -- even though the splits did lower the prices.Â Instead, it's because of something called fractional shares.Â Â Image source: Getty Images.Fractional shares are, not surprisingly, fractions of stock shares. They've existed for a while, and investors could end up with them in limited circumstances, such as when a company merged or split its stock or when an investor participated in a dividend reinvestment program. But you couldn't buy them before, as brokers simply didn't allow it.However, a growing number of brokers now let any investor purchase fractional shares simply by specifying the dollar amount to invest. Depending on the broker, buyers may be able to buy a fraction as small as .001 of a share. With Tesla trading at around $407, that literally makes it a penny stock, since you could buy a very tiny stake in the company for as little as $0.41. And since brokers have largely eliminated commission fees, you wouldn't need extra money to buy or sell your shares, either.Â Of course, not every broker has such a low minimum -- Charles Schwab (NYSE: SCHW), for example, allows fractional share trading in the form of \"stock slices,\" but these cost at least $5. But the bottom line is that fractional shares from any broker do make buying shares of stockÂ much more affordable.Â And while you may be wondering if it's worth buying just $0.41 or $5 worth of Tesla stock, the fact is that there's no real reason not to make the purchase as long as you have a sound investment strategy and are investing in the electric car maker because you believe in its business model. You'll make the same gains, percentage-wise, as you would if you had full shares, so your money will grow if Tesla performs well. And since you can buy more partial shares any time without paying commission, you can build a larger stake over time.There's just one word of caution to keep in mind, though: While Tesla and other companies with high share prices are less risky than penny stocks because they have a track record of performance that's convinced investors their stocks have value, no investment is risk-free. You can't assume that just because Tesla's cost per share is above $400 that the stock is worth that much or is a good buy for you. And you don't want to make any investment without a strong investment thesis, even if you're putting as little as $0.41 at stake.Â  Tesla may well be the right stock for you, but take your time and put in the work to find out.Â 10 stocks we like better thanÂ WalmartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

      "Haber:  BENGALURU, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O chief executive Elon Musk indicated on Friday that the U.S. electric carmaker will make a foray into India in 2021.\"Next year for sure,\" Musk said on Twitter in reply to a post with a photograph of a T-shirt with the message: \"India wants Tesla\".\"Thanks for waiting,\" Musk said.Tesla's entry could come at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is increasingly becoming focussed on promoting the use and manufacture of electric vehicles. India's auto sector, already reeling from a slowdown in demand last year, has been further hit by the novel coronavirus pandemic and carmakers are seeking government support to push sales.Musk commented last year about coming to India, in response to someone on Twitter who asked \"What about India sir?\".\"Would love to be there this year. If not, definitely next!\" he said in March 2019.(Reporting by Nallur Sethuraman in Bengaluru; Editing by Aditya Kalra Editing by Robert Birsel)((Sethuraman.NR@thomsonreuters.com; (+91 8061822737); Reuters Messaging: nallur.sethuraman.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\n",

      "Haber:  Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) rose 4.5% on Thursday after the electric vehicle maker dropped the price of its Model 3 sedan in China.Â Tesla cut the base price of the battery-powered Model 3 by 8% to 249,900 yuan (approximately $36,800), after factoring in Chinese government subsidies. That puts it slightly below the price of a similar version of the vehicle in the U.S., prompting speculation that Tesla could also move to reduce prices in its home market.Â Tesla's stock rallied on Thursday on optimism that lower prices will help to fuel vehicle sales in China. Image source: Getty Images.A new type of battery may have made the price cuts possible. Tesla's standard-range Model 3 sedans will feature less expensive lithium-iron-phosphate batteries, rather than nickel-manganese-cobalt batteries, according to Reuters.Â Â Investors are looking ahead to Tesla's upcoming third-quarter vehicle deliveries report, which is expected to be released in the coming days. The consensus forecast calls for Tesla to report deliveries of 140,000 vehicles, representing growth of 54% compared to the second quarter.Â Some industry watchers say strong vehicle sales in China could help Tesla top Wall Street's estimates. And price cuts might help to drive sales even higher in the quarters ahead.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "Haber:  Investors in the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) were flying high again on Thursday. The index of stocks on the Nasdaq Stock Market once again dramatically outpaced the rest of the market, rising almost 1.5% compared to just a 0.1% gain for the Dow Jones Industrials.From day to day, of course, anything can happen. But this has been a consistent theme throughout 2020. So far this year, the Nasdaq is up a stunning 26%. The Dow's actually down 2% on the year.So what is it that's lifting the Nasdaq to such unprecedented heights? There's a combination of factors at play to give the Nasdaq its day in the sun.Image source: Getty Images.One key element of the Nasdaq's success has been how well some of its biggest components have done. Like most market benchmarks, the Nasdaq Composite is weighted by market capitalization. That gives the top stocks far greater influence over the overall index than their smaller peers.Ordinarily, when companies get big, they stop growing as fast. That's because most big businesses have already tapped into their most obvious growth opportunities, and their addressable markets have started to mature.Yet on Thursday, investors once again saw huge outperformance from some of the biggest companies on the exchange. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) weighed in with a 5% rise, while Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) picked up 4%.That's been the case all year long. Tesla's up a whopping 434% on the year. Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) has added 74%, while Netflix is higher by 63%, and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is up 59%.What those big stocks do has a huge effect on the overall Nasdaq. But there's a greater paradigm shift going on that's making even those giant tech companies look up and pay attention.Even if big stocks have the most mathematical impact on the Nasdaq, small companies arguably have more of a positive psychological effect. In particular, the way in which high-growth tech start-ups not only defied the coronavirus bear market but thrived during it shows the value of resilient business models.Consider how these upstarts have done:Moreover, the performance of these companies is restoring investor confidence in the overall stock market. Even as big-name businesses have had trouble during the coronavirus crisis, these aggressive players in fast-growing industries have shown that you can find individual companies with strong prospects. Moreover, their share prices can and will go up as they find success.The Nasdaq has become the focal point of attention for growth investors looking for great stocks. That's not to say you can't find good investments elsewhere, but at least in 2020, the Nasdaq's been the place to be.Find out why Zoom Video Communications is one of the 10 best stocks to buy nowMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

      "Haber:  Taking advantage of new battery options and big government subsidies, TeslaÂ (NASDAQ: TSLA) has slashed its Model 3 prices in China. The company's Chinese website is now advertising a base price for the popular battery-electric sedan of 249,900 yuan, or roughly $36,800.While this is big news for the company in its efforts to remain dominant in the Chinese market, U.S. consumers won't be affected...at least, not yet.Â Image source: Tesla.The new price of the Shanghai-made Model 3 Standard Range Plus represents an 8% discount to the previously listed price of 271,550 yuan, or about $40,000. Tesla factors in Chinese government subsidies for electric vehicles (EVs) when it calculates the base price.Â In the U.S., the base price for the Model 3 Standard Range Plus is $37,990, making the Chinese Model 3 slightly cheaper than the U.S. version. That's largely due to superior government incentives. U.S. federal tax credits for Tesla's EVs were phased out at the beginning of this year. However, Tesla's website claims that \"potential incentives\" could reduce the U.S. price even further.Tesla was also able to cut the price by using a different kind of battery.Â The automaker received approval from the Chinese government in June for the authority to build Model 3s at its Shanghai Gigafactory using lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries. LFP batteries are cheaper than Tesla's preferred nickel cobalt aluminum (NCA) batteries because they don't use cobalt, a rare and expensive -- not to mention controversial -- metal.LFPs, though, are less energy-dense than NCAs, which can affect performance. However, along with the price cut, Tesla bumped the Chinese model's range from 445 km to 468 km, about 290 miles. The U.S. version's range is still listed as 250 miles.Â 10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "Haber:  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOne thing I don’t like to do is chase trends. It is a pet peeve of mine to buy what the masses are buying. I found that more often than not we’d be doomed to trail. At best the results would be mediocre. The best outcomes usually come from diligent homework and looking ahead where others are not yet focusing. Ideally, we’d want to set a trend not follow it. Today, we discuss trading three stocks for 2021.The point is to find opportunities now that are still hidden from the others. That gives us a head start because we would be ahead of the chase. Ideally we’d want the herd to catch on later and follow us into it. At which time the profits will materialize in droves. Taking such chances also may result in big whiffs so proper risk management is important.I consider today’s three theses somewhat speculative. Therefore, conviction should be moderate. While the logic is viable, there is no immediate tangible trigger to go long here. Besides, logical or not, nobody accused Wall Street of being perfectly wise. They are an unpredictable bunch, especially in 2020. Since I’d rather be safe than sorry, I have to temper my enthusiasm and leave room for error. A good first step is to keep the size at levels that don’t break my bank or my heart.The three stocks for 2021 are in the news now and I bet they will continue to be so for months. They are:Nikola was a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) that burst onto the scene with massive fanfare. The rally was immense and violent. In a manner of days, the stock rallied 500%. Investors bought it with panic and FOMO, leaving a trail of bloodied bears. When I first saw the company spokesperson Trevor Milton in an interview I disliked him a bunch. My first impression was that he was more proud of his stock than his company. Then I thought I was the odd man out, so I overcame my skepticism.I guess I should have stuck to my initial gut. He has now left the company and with a potential misconduct case against him too boot. Needless to say the stock experienced excessive hate and plummeted 70% in under two weeks. Today, my contention is that this is an opportunity to get long NKLA stock into next year.It goes against the grain of what the so-called experts are opining in the media. Hate has hit extreme levels, so the theory here is that we have run out of incremental sellers. If that’s true, then the upside potential becomes the more likely outcome. General Motors (NYSE:GM) has recently announced an alliance with Nikola. The new CEO kept the hopes alive about that deal and others. Confirmation or updates on those fronts, especially the GM one, are potential catalysts.From near $20 per share the target could be a double within six months. Where it bounced this week was a level that was the absolute perfect top in March. It again served as the perfect base for the mega-breakout in May. This was not a coincidence. Machines are doing most of the trading and they know which pivot levels matter most. As long as the stock is above $16 per share, then my thesis is alive. The options market allows for cheap ways of putting this strategy in action with limited risk. This is definitely a “buy and hope” trade, and every portfolio needs some of those.Although Tesla is closely related to Nikola, it is most definitely not in the same boat. Elon Musk has turned his ship around beyond most expectations. My bet today is that it will continue to raise eyebrows next year and in a good way. The situation there went from life support last year to extreme success now. The crazy part is that TSLA stock powered through the novel coronavirus pandemic. Somehow Tesla went from inches from collapse to having one of the best balance sheets on Wall Street.The basis of the bullish thesis is that Tesla is not a car company. The fans argue that it’s either an energy or a technology company. If that’s true, then the company is overdue in starting to talk up the other points. So far all the headlines are almost entirely about car production, targets or deadlines. Therein lies the bulk of the opportunity I want to capture.There is a real possibility that by early next year they start broaching topics on their other income streams. When that happens, the bear case takes a beating. Because finally there would be proof of the concept that it’s not just a car company. I bet that a large number of skeptics would opt to cover their positions. This year, TSLA stock has astonished investors and I expect this to continue into next year. If I am wrong, then it continues to plunk along the status quo. Being up 780% in 12 months is a good place to be. That’s an investment worth holding regardless of my thesis.A few years ago, pot stocks were all the rage, not EVs. Canopy Growth was the face of that bunch much like Tesla is to EVs now. Mainstream investors gobbled up the cannabis stocks like there was no tomorrow. Now it’s a different story as CGC stock is down 40% in a year and it’s a sector-wide scenario. After having extreme hopium in the beginning stages in 2018, sentiment swung to the other extreme. Pot stocks hardly get any attention in the news unless it’s disasters.It’s almost the same thesis as NKLA … CGC stock is so bad that it’s good. But there are also technical reasons to think that. CGC has become the proxy trade on cannabis stocks. It has the best balance sheet, so it is fit to navigate the many extra hurdles that the industry has. This is still an illegal activity in many U.S. states. Yet the stocks are still trying to rally. It recently fell hard on a sympathy move with Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB). If left alone, Canopy Growth will find footing and recover.Technically, $15 per share was important to hold, so now it’s a challenge on the way back up. Regardless, the evidence on the chart suggests that CGC stock has held reasonably well through the pandemic. It has had two bounces since the lows, so I bet it holds one more time. If I’m correct, then the bulls have the opportunity to swing higher into year end. My thesis today is not only to capture that move, but also to speculate on next year’s headlines. The election might open the door for the legalization talks at the Federal level. That rhetoric alone would be a massive catalyst for the whole sector. Sometimes a little bit of hopium is what a stock needs.In addition to our arguments today, we have to pay attention to the macroeconomic conditions. Reports show that we are in a recovery from the pandemic crash. Everything points in the right direction, but then there are the uncertainties that the U.S. elections brings. The first presidential debate this week demonstrated it will not be a quiet one. In fact, we probably won’t know the outcome of the contest until weeks after the fact. Equity investors do not like such potential trepidation, so they will be quick to sell on headlines. Luckily the companies I picked today as being among the best stocks for 2021 are speculative; therefore, they will not necessarily follow the market-wide direction.On the date of publication, Nicolas Chahine did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.The post 3 of the Best Stocks to Trade for 2021 appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\n",

Nine of the 11 major S&P sectors were trading higher after the Trump administration proposed a new stimulus bill to House Democrats worth more than $1.5 trillion, which includes a $20 billion extension in aid for the battered airline industry.

Gains on Thursday were led by tech-related heavyweights including Apple Inc AAPL.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, Tesla Inc TSLA.O and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O, which investors perceive as relatively safe at a time of heightened economic uncertainty.On the other hand, energy stocks .SPNY tumbled another 2.7% after a 20% decline in the third quarter.With the presidential election now less than five weeks away, analysts have warned of higher volatility over the next few weeks.\"Volatility is going to come back in a big way, as opposed to the second quarter, when we were able to just forget everything and pile money into the market,\" said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh.At 11:49 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 102.33 points, or 0.37%, at 27,884.03, the S&P 500 .SPX was up 18.85 points, or 0.56%, at 3,381.85, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 116.10 points, or 1.04%, at 11,283.60.Boeing Co BA.N rose 1.8% a day after Federal Aviation Administration Chief Steve Dickson conducted a 737 MAX test flight, a milestone for the jet to win approval to resume flying after two fatal crashes.

As of 12:15 p.m. EDT, the stock was up 3.2%.The growth stock's gain comes as the automaker signed an agreement with Piedmont LithiumÂ (NASDAQ: PLL) for lithium supply. In addition, Tesla may be looking to acquire a stake in LG Energy Solution, a battery business that will soon divest from LG Chem, according to a separate report.Image source: Getty Images.The news of Tesla's five-year lithium supply agreement with Piedmont puts some action behind some of the bold vision the electric-car company laid out for its battery ambitions at its Battery Day event last week.\"We are excited to be working with Tesla, which represents the start of the first US domestic lithium supply chain and a disruption to the current value chain,\" said Piedmont CEO Keith Phillips in a press release Monday morning.A stake in LG Energy Solution would similarly bolster Tesla's competitive positioning in the battery industry. \"Tesla is looking to acquire a stake in LG Energy Solution. Specifically, Tesla is said to be exploring taking up to a 10 percent stake in LG Energy Solution,\" an anonymous source reportedly told The Korea Times.Â At Tesla's Battery Day event last week, CEO Elon Musk unveiled plans to vertically integrate some of its battery production.

      "Haber:  By Marc JonesLONDON, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Financial markets roared into the second half of the year in full-throttle comeback mode. The only problem was that the coronavirus came back too.The pandemic never really went away of course, but as the charts below show, up until a few weeks ago investors seemed happy to ride the rebound without too much worry about second waves of infection.Fuelled by over $20 trillion of global stimulus and super-charged tech stocks, MSCI's world stocks index .MIWD00000PUS piled on 14% over July and August to reclaim the record highs it surrendered in February when COVID first spiralled.Oil LCOc1 gained a further 10%, August saw sustained moves out of government bond and gold XAU= bolt holes US10YT=RR, DE10YT=RR, video app Zoom ZM.O kept zooming and even the world's poorest countries were on a tear in debt markets.Then September came!Renewed lockdowns from Melbourne to Madrid compounded concerns that the marauding rally had overshot as rallies often do. World stocks shuddered, giving back over 8% in three weeks, and led down for once by the big tech titans.\"People just got a bit complacent in August watching all the tech stocks march higher without too much of a thought,\" said IG's chief market analyst, Chris Beauchamp. \"It just needed a decent correction, and that is exactly what we got.\"Apple AAPL.O and Amazon AMZN.O, Google GOOG, Facebook FB.O, Netflix NFLX.O and Tesla TSLA.O all took double-digit dunkings that wobbled the rest of the \"risk\" complex from corporate debt to EM currencies.Europe's bank stocks slumped back to an all time low, while Argentina's freshly-restructured government bonds lost a quarter of their value to score the worst relaunch into markets since Greece in 2012. The quarter as a whole still looks broadly positive though. World stocks are up roughly 6%, the FANGS 28%, oil 2%, Italy's bonds nearly 8% despite 160% debt-to-GDP, and stocks in the least developed 'frontier' countries have jumped 9%.A seesawing of major currencies has also happened. The safe-haven dollar =USD was down 10% from March up until the September wobble. It is still down over 3% for Q3, which will be its worst since mid 2017, but this month it is up 3%.\"You had such a big fall in the dollar, 5% (in July) in just a few weeks..So this rebound is people stepping back a bit,\" said Francois Savary, Chief Investment Officer of Prime Partners. \"But I think it is purely a short-term phenomenon.\"For now though it has meant more pain in emerging markets.Brazil's real BRL= is down nearly 30% for the year. Russia's rouble RUB= - one of last year's top performers - is down 16% and 9% in Q3 despite a near bullet-proof balance sheet. Turkey's record low lira TRY= has fallen a further 12% this quarter while Mexico's peso MXN= and South Africa's rand ZAR= are down 14% and 20% for the year despite calmer Q3s.With global central banks hoovering up bonds at a rate of $1.5 billion per hour according to BofA analysts, life has remained good in debt markets.Italy's 10% bond returns have been helped by a super-sized COVID rescue plan, Suriname's bonds have made 33.5% as its fears of default have eased, while even hyperinflation-hit Venezuela has jumped 19%, albeit still only to 12 cents on the dollar.A breakdown of the best- and worst-performing stocks also tells the story of the coronavirus pandemic, which has now claimed nearly a million lives and sent unemployment soaring.Malaysian rubber glove maker Supermax SUPM.KL and Korean pharmaceutical firm Shin Poong 019170.KS have both rocketed more than 1,000%.The boom in video chat has lifted Zoom ZM.O 630%, Moderna MRNA.O, one of the drug firms in the race for a vaccine, is up over 250%, while sit-on-your-sofa stocks like Netflix NFLX.O and Amazon AMZN.O have jumped 49% and 67% respectively.At the other end, cruise ship company Carnival CCL.N has sunk 70%, scores of airlines, travel firms and retailers have been battered while aero engine maker Rolls Royce RR.L has been pummelled 45% this quarter and nearly 80% for the year.And there is still the fourth quarter to navigate with its race for a COVID-19 vaccine, the race for the White House, and the race to avoid a no-deal Brexit that would end a 3-1/2 year long Britain-Brussels standoff with an explosive bang.Ashmore's Jan Dehn is bracing for another wild few months.\"Data are not getting any stronger and are beginning to roll over and you have all the political noise ahead of the U.S. elections which is starting to get a little frayed.\"On top of that we have markets which are very expensive because they have rallied like mad since March,\" he said.Global financial markets in 2020https://tmsnrt.rs/2S4NUHpStocks: biggest winners and losers of 2020https://tmsnrt.rs/3cEZnXrCurrencies vs the dollar in 2020https://tmsnrt.rs/3cCFnVoWorld's main stock indexes in 2020https://tmsnrt.rs/2S3nWnx(Additional reporting by Thyagaraju Adinarayan in London Editing by Mark Heinrich)((marc.jones@thomsonreuters.com; +44 (0)20 7513 4042; Reuters Messaging: marc.jones.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net  Twitter @marcjonesrtrs))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\n",

      "Haber:  Australian miner Piedmont Lithium (NASDAQ: PLL) has signed a major deal with Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). Piedmont has agreed to supply the electric-vehicle maker with high-grade lithium ore from its deposit in North Carolina for five years, beginning sometime after mid-2022.Piedmont said that it has agreed to supply Tesla's Nevada battery factory with at least 160,000 tons per year of spodumene concentrate (or \"SC6\"), a concentrated lithium ore, for the term of the deal. The deal is expected to generate between 10% and 20% of the total revenue from Piedmont's proposed mining and refining project at its North Carolina site.Â Image source: The Motley Fool.The deal is conditioned on the companies agreeing to a start date sometime between July 2022 and July 2023. The precise date will depend on the development schedules of both parties, Piedmont said.The deal will be extended for a second five-year term if both parties agree. The agreed-on quantity is a minimum; Tesla has the option to order more than 160,000 tons of SC6 per year if needed.Â Piedmont CEO Keith Phillips said in a statement that the deal represents the beginning of a U.S. domestic supply chain for lithium.Â \"We will now accelerate our mine/concentrator development to support Tesla's plans, work to further expand our mineral resources, and potential increase our planned annual spodumene concentrate production capacity,\" Phillips said.Phillips said that Piedmont is continuing to develop its own ability to produce lithium hydroxide from spodumene concentrate at its site in North Carolina. It expects toÂ  produce about 22,700 tons of lithium hydroxide per year once that capacity is online.Â 10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "Haber:  Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) inked a \"five-year fixed-price binding agreement\" to buy lithium from Australian miner Piedmont Lithium (NASDAQ: PLL) this morning, igniting a rally in lithium stocks. Piedmont's own shares are up 210% as of 10 a.m. EDT, while rival producers Lithium Americas (NYSE: LAC) and LiventÂ (NYSE: LTHM) are coming along for the ride, up 17% and 8.4%, respectively. Â According to the terms of the agreement, Piedmont will supply spodumene concentrate (a rock rich in lithium) to Tesla for at least five years, but possibly as long as 10 years, extracting the material from its North Carolina mines. Piedmont will earmark approximately one-third of its planned production of 160,000 tons per year for use by Tesla. Tesla may order more than this if it needs more, \"at Tesla's option.\"There is one condition: Tesla and Piedmont must agree to start deliveries sometime between July 2022 and July 2023.Today's story is much ado about a rock -- a lithium spodumene rock to be precise. Image source: Getty Images.Last week, at its ballyhooed \"Battery Day,\" Tesla laid out plans to use a novel production method to mix table salt with Nevadan clay, add water, and precipitate out lithium for use in producing its own rechargeable vehicle batteries. Tesla was not 100% clear on when this production method would become viable, however, or on how long it might take before Tesla could become independent of lithium suppliers and vertically integrate lithium production into its operations.Today's announcement from Piedmont, centering on a five-to-10-year supply agreement, strongly suggests that Tesla isn't planning to become wholly independent of lithium suppliers for quite some time. That's good news for lithium companies Lithium Americas and Livent -- and great news for Piedmont Lithium.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "Haber:  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFew companies can match up to Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) meteoric rise to fame this year. The electric vehicle company started the year on a low note, when it was forced to shut down its plants at home and abroad in lieu of the pandemic. This dampened production levels and put Tesla stock in jeopardy.Thanks to the resilience of its tenacious CEO, Elon Musk, the company reopened its plants, defying government orders. A triumphant comeback in the months that followed. The company stock rallied at an impressive 437% this year and has a market capitalization of $375 billion.Despite its successes, Tesla stock dipped this week, after Battery Day. The event hosted by Elon Musk on September 22, discussed the new technologies that could potentially drive down the costs of producing electric vehicles.Tesla’s stock fell by 7% in the after-market hours.At Tesla’s socially distanced Battery Day this year, the company made some big announcements about the future of its vehicles. The highlight of the event was Musk’s plan to build an electric vehicle for just $25,000;  with the help of low-cost batteries. A car at this cost could push Tesla into the mainstream market and make it the biggest automaker in the world.But while this should have been great news for shareholders, the company’s share price fell in the after-market hours.The ambitious plan outlined by Musk did not come with a definite timeline or budget, only stating that it would take three years for the company to successfully lower the cost of the batteries.The CEO, known for his grandiose claims left many investors a little skeptical.Tesla also announced that it working on a new battery at its Fremont plant which would make its cars more affordable. This would be a huge win for the company. The current battery, which is made up of millions of cells, is the most expensive part of the car.The newer version will feature a different design and will be manufactured with fewer cells.It will also be six times more powerful than the batteries Tesla currently uses in its cars. Tesla outsources its battery production to Panasonic but the slow pace of production at the supplier’s plant has resulted in delays for Tesla.The new batteries could push Tesla into the mainstream market and create massive gains for investors. But until there is tangible progress on the new technology investors remain wary of the optimistic goals.In line with the new batteries which will lower the cost of producing cars, Musk detailed the company’s production numbers for the upcoming year. Vehicle deliveries are expected to increase by 30-40% from the previous year. The total number of cars produced by Tesla in 2019 amounted to 367,500. The new guidance for the next year is set between 477,750 and 514,500 cars.If Tesla is able to deliver on its promise, the total number of deliveries for the year would amount to 500,000. This is just below its pre-pandemic estimate.In order to accommodate the increase in production capacity, Musk also announced that the company will open its first European car assembly plan in Berlin along with a second plant in Texas. The CEO also believes that Tesla’s production plant in China will eventually reach a production capacity of 1 million.Tesla’s ability to produce a large number of vehicles at scale has been one of the key reasons for the company’s reigning success.Elon Musk’s ambitious plans for Tesla had many investors questioning the credibility of the goals. But if the company is able to keep its promise on the $25,000 electric vehicle and its expected production numbers, it will cement Tesla’s position as the leader of the auto industry.The short-term dip shouldn’t deter investors from buying Tesla stock but use it as an opportunity to invest while prices are slightly lower. It’s also worth noting that in a pandemic economy that has left many companies on the brink of collapse, the automaker’s stock is up more than 400% this year.On the date of publication, Divya Premkumar did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.Divya Premkumar has a finance degree from the University of Houston, Texas.

      "Haber:  Of the many hyper-growth themes emerging today, artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics are among those sure to have the most profound impact on day-to-day life.With that status comes significant investigation implications, making AI and robotics exchange traded funds some of the more compelling and, potentially durable, options in the world of thematic funds. ETFs are practical avenues for investors searching for AI and robotics exposure because this still nascent arena is difficult to stock pick in and many of the names investors initially view as AI or robotics plays aren't yet generating significant portions of revenue from those fields.The Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ) solves those conundrums. BOTZ, which recently turned four years old, has $1.72 billion in assets under management, confirming that there's demand to tap into AI and robotics investing.What makes BOTZ a compelling long-term growth idea is the sheer depth of the markets the fund addresses. Many investors are familiar with the concepts of industrial robots working in Amazon (AMZN) warehouses or efforts by Tesla (TSLA) and others to develop autonomous vehicles. However, there's much more to these universes than just two applications.Advanced robotics are now cornerstones in the surgical field while declining technology costs are giving rise to increased used of automation – a driver for AI – across myriad industries. Those are just two examples of favorable tailwinds behind BOTZ.Thematic DurabilityA critical element to the AI/Robotics thesis is that it's durable. Focusing on automation for a moment, it simply makes good, long-term business sense.“Automation can help companies reshore operations, reduce labor costs, and mitigate potential supply chain disruptions,” said Morningstar analyst Alex Bryan in a recent note. “Machines don’t get sick or tired, they don’t form unions, and they tend to be more consistent than humans, allowing for greater quality control. Simple repetitive tasks are most conducive to automation, but technological advances are allowing machines to handle more-complex tasks, from enabling vehicles to drive themselves to analyzing medical images.”Big data is powering AI growth and that reaches into arenas such as financial services, logistics automation and e-commerce, confirming a widespread opportunity set for many BOTZ components. There are other implications as well. Consider OpenAI’s new GPT-3 software.“At this point, the toolset can pen poetry and text messages, compose music, generate computer code, and seamlessly answer questions. GPT-3 is still in private beta and only a few hundred developers have access to the software,” according to Global X research. “However, those who do are making quick use of it. One developer is using the toolset to automate email responses; another is using it to build characters in text-based computer games.”Growth at a Reasonable PriceMany of the 31 holdings in BOTZ, including Nvidia (NVDA) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), are classified as growth stocks and the ETF reflected as much with an estimated price-to-earnings for 2020 of 47.46x. By no means is that inexpensive. However, that's just one metric and it doesn't paint the entire picture.“Valuations here are high but not extreme. The fund’s holdings look expensive relative to forward earnings, but they look cheaper relative to book value and sales, trading at lower multiples of those metrics than the constituents of the Russell 1000 Growth Index,” notes Morningstar's Bryan. “Consensus long-term earnings growth estimates presented in Morningstar Direct suggest the market has similar growth expectations for the holdings of this fund and the Russell 1000 Growth Index.”Bottom line: BOTZ may not be cheap in the strictest sense of the word, but it's not excessively expensive, either. Its growth could be worth paying for.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\n",

      "Haber:  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe electric-vehicle boom has its foot firmly on the gas. While some of the top EV stocks look at bit toppy {Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Nio Inc. (NYSE:NIO), for example}, they can still climb a great deal further. That’s especially true for Workhorse Group (NASDAQ:WKHS) stock. The last time I weighed in on WKHS stock, I said, “I believe.. {the} stock could double with a good deal of patience for a few reasons, including the EV boom, solid contracts, and an $18 billion last-mile delivery opportunity.”That was on Aug. 26, as WKHS stock traded at a low of $17.03. Shortly afterwards, Workhorse jumped to a high of $30.99 before pulling back with the broader market. However, with patience, I strongly believe the stock could double from its current levels.After all, it has very solid catalysts that should give the shares plenty of horsepower.Global demand for EVs is only expected to grow.According to the International Energy Agency, we could see about 130 million EVs on the road by 2030, a monumental move from 5.1 million in 2018.And, according to The New York Times contributor Jack Ewing, traditional car companies are playing catch up to big-named EV companies like Tesla. “The traditional carmakers’ best hope to avoid oblivion will be to exploit their expertise in supply chains and mass production to churn out economical electrical cars by the millions,” he wrote.“The traditional car industry is still behind,” added Peter Carlsson, who ran Tesla’s supplier network. “But there is a massive amount of resources going into the race to beat Tesla. A number, not all, of the big carmakers are going to catch up.”In short, the EV market is poised to increase significantly and could be a very big part of the future of autos. Just weeks ago, the company announced a contract with Ryder (NYSE:R), which will begin offering Workhorse’s C-Series Workhorse all-electric step vans to its customers.There’s also speculation that Workhorse could win a $6 billion United States Postal Service (USPS) next-generation delivery truck contract. That deal would do incredible things for a stock with a market cap of just $2.55 billion at the moment.USPS is looking to replace an aging fleet of trucks.“The post office now uses about 140,000 Grumman Long Life Vehicles for its main delivery service. Manufactured from 1987 through 1994, they need to be replaced. A 2014 audit from the office of the USPS inspector general found that the current fleet was expected to only meet the delivery needs of the agency through the 2017 fiscal year,” says Trucks.com contributor Jerry Hirsch.There are plenty of catalysts that have the potential to tremendously boost the shares. It already inked a deal with Ryder, and there’s hope that it can win the contract with USPS.In addition, Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne is impressed by  WKHS stock.  “The [second half production] ramp remains on track and management continues to target [making] 300 [to] 400 vehicles by the end of the year. After a tough few quarters, we see greener pastures ahead.”While the shares won’t explode overnight, I strongly believe that they could double. I said the same thing as the stock traded at $17.03 before it ran to nearly $31 a share.Buy it, then forget about it.  Check on it in about a year. The investment should pay off nicely.On the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. Ian Cooper, an InvestorPlace.com contributor, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.

      "Haber:  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIs the correction over? It may not look that way yet in some market indices — and many stocks for that matter. But under the surface, the Nasdaq Composite and many of its most influential tech stocks’ price charts are warning otherwise and advising investors it’s nearly time to buy more smartly.If you’re a superstitious kind of investor, the proposition of the market having bottomed isn’t going to be an easy one to accept. The Nasdaq Composite’s corrective loss does stand at the numerologically unlucky 13%. That low also formed over 13 days. And of course, investors are still faced with the month of October. Boo!Still, there is solid evidence indicating a low has formed.The fact is most corrections don’t grow into full-blown bear markets. And 13% isn’t a run-of-the-mill pullback unworthy of becoming an intermediate low. Also and appreciatively, the VIX — or fear index — has optimistically warned investors that overly confident bulls have been sufficiently spooked.Of course some may see the massive disconnect between a still-struggling Main Street and a Wall Street fueled by the Federal Reserve and a handful of trillion-dollar, hyper-influential growth stocks and believe it has to get uglier first. That’s understandable, but the reality is it doesn’t.In all fairness, what is needed to confirm the Nasdaq’s bottom is a market-based follow-through day. The bullish price and volume indicator has proven a robust one without equal. The fact is no major low in the market has developed without a follow-through day in place.Now and at day four of the follow-through day count for the Nasdaq, an index which led the broader market up from the Covid-19 March low, it’s time to seriously look at the price charts of three tech stocks well-positioned for buying within the framework of a new market rally.\n",
      "Source: Charts by TradingViewThe first of our tech stocks to buy is Tesla. On the daily time frame, the EV heavyweight has put together an unsurprisingly more volatile, but constructive higher-low, double-bottom pattern. Friday’s early action has confirmed the formation’s second pivot low.Tesla’s confirmation is demonstrating technical leadership at this point within the large-cap tech-stock arena. It’s obviously bullish. However, I’d like to see stochastics swing slightly higher to generate a crossover and an extra layer of protection for investors before making a buy decision.Of course, a follow-through day will also be likely critical to the double-bottom’s durability. As such, a tiny bit of patience (in the scheme of things) in TSLA (and possibly buying into a slightly less picture-perfect entry) makes sense.\n",
      "Source: Charts by TradingViewThe next of our tech stocks to buy are shares of Apple. Here, investors may want to look at the weekly timeframe rather than the daily. This massive tech company is less volatile and not exactly in the same category of momentum investing as Tesla.Technically, the weekly chart in Apple shows September’s correction has yielded a test of the 38% retracement level from the stock’s March low. Favorably, stochastics are just entering oversold territory too. Nice, right? Well, some traders will tell you otherwise. With its recent low, a full 25% removed from its all-time-high, shares are in a bear market. Boo! Wrong.The advice today on this tech stock to buy is simply wait for confirmation of a bottom. Reasonably, the expectation is that will happen next week alongside a FTD in the Nasdaq.\n",
      "Source: Charts by TradingViewThe last of today’s tech stocks to buy is Nvidia. Here, I’ve elected to focus on the weekly chart in the semiconductor giant. Shares modestly breached a slightly aggressive trendline formed off NVDA’s Covid-19 bottom formed back in March. But the slight failure has been quickly countered with the stock reversing back above support.What I’m recommending in shares of NVDA is similar to the advice in AAPL. First, a follow-through day is important. That could happen today if a sufficiently strong rally develops into the closing bell. Either way, I’m also advising investors wait until next week to buy Nvidia, and only get in after a pivot low has been confirmed on the weekly chart.Right now, this buying strategy sets up on a rally through this week’s high of $509.08. The entry for this tech stock sacrifices a couple percent from current levels. More importantly, though, investors will have the market acting as a tailwind should it signal and the opportunity for less dicey, big-time profits.On the date of publication, Chris Tyler does not hold, directly or indirectly, positions in any securities mentioned in this article.Chris Tyler is a former floor-based, derivatives market maker on the American and Pacific exchanges.

      "Haber:  By Ben KlaymanDETROIT, Sept 24 (Reuters) - ChargePoint Inc, one of the world's oldest and largest electric vehicle charging networks, said on Thursday it will go public by merging with Switchback Energy Acquisition Corp SBE.N in a deal that values the company at $2.4 billion.The deal is expected to close near the end of the year and the company will be named ChargePoint Holdings Inc. A trading symbol on the New York Stock Exchange has not been identified.Reuters last week reported ChargePoint and Switchback were nearing a deal. Switchback is a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) that raised $300 million in an initial public offering in July 2019. \"The EV charging industry is accelerating and it is expected that charging infrastructure investment will be $190 billion by 2030,\" Switchback Chief Executive Scott McNeill said. \"We believe (ChargePoint) will continue to grow its strong market position as the EV industry evolves.\"The deal will raise about $493 million in proceeds that ChargePoint will use to expand in North America and Europe. It includes $225 million from Baillie Gifford, Neuberger Berman Alternatives Advisors and other institutional investors. Baillie Gifford is one of the largest shareholders in EV segment leader Tesla Inc TSLA.O.\"Being ready to be public means that you're investing in scaling the platforms you already have because this addressable market is very, very large,\" ChargePoint Chief Executive Pasquale Romano, who will continue to lead the company after the deal closes, told Reuters.A SPAC is a shell company that raises money through an initial public offering to buy an operating entity, typically within two years.SPACs have emerged as a quick route to the stock market for companies, particularly auto technology startups, and have proven popular with investors seeking to echo Tesla's high stock valuation. Other EV companies with SPAC deals include Fisker, Lordstown Motors and Canoo. Electric and fuel cell vehicle startup Nikola NKLA.O, which has been called a fraud by a short seller and seen its founder resign, is another. Prior to the SPAC deal, ChargePoint, which operates but does not own its charging network, had raised more than $660 million.The Campbell, California-based company, founded in 2007, has attracted funding from both private venture investors and large strategic investors, including Daimler DAIGn.DE, BMW BMWG.DE, Siemens AG SIEGn.DE and U.S. energy firms Chevron Corp CVX.N and American Electric Power Co Inc. AEP.NChargePoint operates more than 115,000 charging ports  globally, mostly in North America, and previously said it is aiming to increase that to 2.5 million by 2025.ChargePoint's revenue was $147 million last year and it forecasts growth to more than $2 billion in 2026, according to slides presented to investors.

      "Haber:  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAfter sputtering around following its explosive debut, Spartan Energy Acquisition (NYSE:SPAQ), the “filler” name for what will eventually be Fisker Inc. via a special acquisition company, enjoyed a brilliant way to start the week. On Sep. 14, SPAQ stock shot up 14.6%, finally looking like the electric vehicle competitor the underlying company marketed it to be.However, I can understand why many investors remain skeptical about Fisker. First, the enthusiasm toward EVs have reached a manic phase. Seemingly, everyone and their dog is forwarding an EV concept – with institutional backing to match.As Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fans will be quick to remind you, nobody can catch Elon Musk and company. They are too far ahead of the game.Second, SPAQ stock carries baggage, both current and legacy related. As our own Larry Ramer noted, Fisker initially gained credibility regarding its talks with Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VLKAF) for a shared EV platform. However, those talks could fall through, especially because Volkswagen is planning its own EV development.Further, Fisker founder Henrik Fisker years ago attempted to make an EV company but failed. With that blight on his record, SPAQ stock seems even riskier than other EV startups.Fundamentally, I agree with Ramer and other analysts who share his opinion. By no means is SPAQ stock a reliable investment. Certainly, you can lose big in this speculation.But I do take issue on one of Ramer’s criticisms: little to no product differentiation. According to Ramer, while Henrik Fisker is a legendary auto designer, other companies will hire their own top-shelf designers. Thus, outside of pricing – which may only result in a limited impact – Fisker may have an identity crisis.However, I couldn’t disagree more. Differentiation is exactly what Fisker is bringing to the table with its groundbreaking Ocean SUV.You see, we humans are not that different. Rather than viewing SPAQ stock through the lens of technical differentiation, you must view the investment as a consumer. Think about it – when you buy a car, what motivated you to consider it as a purchase/lease option?Yes, you can lie to yourself and talk about a car’s reliability or its connectivity features just like you lie to your significant other when you are caught gawking at another person because they “have a great personality.” Stop it. You’re only deep-diving the pros and cons of a vehicle because its exterior styling initially attracted you.In other words, features don’t sell cars. Hype does. Sex and marketing also play a pivotal role. Otherwise, why would you buy an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) smartphone when so many other competitors provide equivalent or better features? Sure, Apple has a great ecosystem, but let’s get real – Apple has a powerful brand.Of course, Tesla leads when it comes to EV branding. Surely, the Fisker brand will not be able to compete in this arena. Therefore, the company is approaching the space with its best weapon: design.While I get the fact that Tesla hires excellent designers, this is a technology firm that’s building an EV. On the other hand, Fisker is an automotive company first, incorporating technology to complement the design element.And let’s also not forget another fact supporting SPAQ stock: just because Tesla is in the lead today does not mean it will maintain that dominance. Look, people have different tastes. If they didn’t, Ford (NYSE:F) will be No.1  for all eternity.If you recall from your history books, Henry Ford once quipped that, “Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black.” Ford made the comment during the dawn of the assembly line and mass production, so it made sense.It doesn’t make sense right now. Especially, it does not make sense in higher price brackets.As you know, automotive manufacturers are not going to invest money differentiating their products for economy cars. These are for customers that could give two rips – I prefer using another word – about exterior styling. Thus, the extra money invested in differentiation would be wasted.However, that’s not the case for those spending big money on their vehicles. Not only do they want top-notch features, they want to stand out. That’s why you’ll never see Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) build a boring car. Otherwise, the ghost of Enzo Ferrari will condemn the blasphemer to perdition.In a similar vein, Fisker is forging through a difficult path, yes, but it’s the only path. I can imagine a Toyota (NYSE:TM) just bum-rushing Tesla with brute-force production attacks. Obviously, Fisker doesn’t have that capability. Instead, it must rely on its true asset of design inspiration.Finally, just keep in mind that Tesla, no matter who it hires, won’t build universally attractive cars. As the already crowded combustion-engine market demonstrates, there’s more than enough room for several competitors. Fisker is doing what works for them and it may just pan out for SPAQ stock.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in SPAQ and F.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

      "Haber:  By Sagarika JaisinghaniSept 24 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were subdued on Thursday as investors braced for another staggering weekly jobless claims figure, the latest evidence of a slowing economic recovery from a pandemic-led recession.The Labor Department's report, due at 8:30 a.m. ET, is likely to show 840,000 Americans filed for unemployment benefits in the week ended Sept. 19. Although down slightly from 860,000 in the previous week, it would still signal a cooling in the labor market's rebound. Wall Street's main indexes have stumbled this month, with the S&P 500 .SPX hovering just above correction territory on waning hopes of more fiscal stimulus, signs of choppy economic growth and a sell-off in heavyweight technology-related names.The Nasdaq .IXIC entered correction territory earlier this month, but the blue-chip Dow .DJI has outperformed its peers on demand for value-linked stocks .IVX such as industrials .SPLRCI.At 6:55 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were up 47 points, or 0.18%, S&P 500 e-minis EScv1 were up 4.25 points, or 0.13%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were down 11.75 points, or 0.11%Apple Inc AAPL.O, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, Netflix Inc NFLX.O and Google-parent Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O, which have led a Wall Street rally since April, edged lower in premarket trading.A 4% slide put Tesla Inc TSLA.O on course for its third straight day of declines following an underwhelming \"Battery Day\" presentation by Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk.

      "Haber:  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe EV bubble in general may be taking a breather. But, that’s not the case with Workhorse (NASDAQ:WKHS). Shares in the budding electric truck maker have continued to soar, with WKHS stock up more than 75% in the past month. And, that’s no surprise. Between the potential for the company to win a lucrative contract with the U.S. Postal Service (USPS), along with its exposure to Lordstown Motors, it’s clear why investors have continued to bid the stock higher. Yet, following this epic run-up, do shares remain a buy?It depends. On one hand, if both catalysts work out, expect WKHS stock to soar even further. Even as the exuberance sending other EV plays like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) has cooled off. In fact, investors who saw big gains with both these names may be parlaying their profits into this stock.On the other hand, with shares “priced for perfection,” Workhorse could sink back to prior price levels if things fall short. That could either come from the company not securing even a piece of the USPS deal. It could also happen if Lordstown stumbles after it goes public.So, what’s the play here? If you bought in at lower price, you may want to let it ride. But, if you are just considering a position today, it’s best to play it cool for now.The Lordstown catalyst may be getting more attention right now. But, it’s the USPS catalyst that could make or break Workhorse. As I previously discussed, the company is the dark horse contender for the NGDV, or Next Generation Delivery Vehicle contract.What’s that? That’s the Post Office’s large-scale replacement of its aging mail truck fleet. Although not the favorite, even getting a piece of the $6 billion pie would be a massive win for Workhorse.Yet, the potential for WKHS stock goes beyond both of these factors. Earlier this month, Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch initiated coverage, giving shares the equivalent to a “buy” rating.His rationale? Beyond the aforementioned catalysts, Rusch views Workhorse “the leading EV last-mile delivery truck platform,” given its “critical design and operating system advantages.” The analyst is also bullish on the company’s prospects in the drone delivery space.In short, this stock isn’t just a binary bet on the company success with either the USPS contract, or with its interest in Lordstown. But, in the near-term, its stake in the soon-to-be-public electric truck maker will be what moves shares higher (or lower).As InvestorPlace’s Faisal Humayun wrote Sept. 16, while shares have climbed nearly ten-fold in six months, shares may still be cheap due to the company’s 10% stake in Lordstown Motors (LMC).Here’s the situation: privately-held LMC is merging with public SPAC (special purpose acquisition company) DiamondPeak Holdings (NASDAQ:DPHC). And, given the recent run-up in that blank-check company’s shares, Workhorse’s stake could wind up being worth a significant part of its current market capitalization.But, the Lordstown exposure goes beyond just unlocking the value of this “hidden asset.” In exchange for licensing its electric pickup intellectual property, Workhorse received not just an equity stake, but future licensing fees as well.So far, LMC has received more than 27,000 pre-orders for its flagship Endurance EV work truck. Once delivered, these pre-orders could mean over $1.4 billion in revenue. But the potential royalties from these pre-orders is just the start. Given the licensing deal gives Workhorse 1% of Lordstown’s revenue up to the first 200,000 vehicles sold, the company could earn over $100 million.Granted, for a stock with a $2.8 billion market capitalization, $100 million isn’t much of a needle-mover. But, consider these proceeds icing on the cake. It’s $100 million more that Workhorse can but back into growing its EV semi truck business.Put it all together, and WKHS stock looks like a slam-dunk opportunity. Or is it? The stock has plenty in its favor, but its important to note the plenty of concerns at play as well.InvestorPlace’s Thomas Yeung recently detailed the many red flags inherent with both Workhorse and Lordstown. Yet, while these factors could hurt both companies in the long-term, for now the Lordstown “story” will help shares in the near-term.What does that mean for investors? If you bought WKHS stock at lower prices, let it ride, as shares could continue to climb. But, if you have yet to enter a position, it may pay to take a “wait and see” approach.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.Thomas Niel, contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single stock analysis since 2016.The post All Bets Are off for Workhorse Stock Despite This Current Enthusiasm appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\n",

      "Haber:  Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) tumbled on Wednesday. A half hour into the trading day, the stock was down about 7%.The growth stock's downturn follows the electric-car maker's Battery Day event, which included news on the automaker's plans for battery design and manufacturing. The stock's decline suggests investors were largely underwhelmed with the announcements made Tuesday.Image source: Getty Images.While a handful of analysts were encouraged by Tesla's Battery Day update, some seemed disappointed.Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi, for instance, noted that the event included bold aspirations but lacked specifics. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said the event \"largely lived up to the hype, but didn't clearly exceed it.\" Canaccord analyst Jed Dorsheimer actually lowered his 12-month price target on the stock from $442 to $377, noting that the automaker may ultimately let down investors who consider Tesla a tech giant. Finally, Baird analyst Ben Kallo lifted his 12-month price target for the stock from $332 to $360, but he noted that the company lacks near-term catalysts and he's concerned about how demand will fare in the current economic environment.Overall, it seems that the hype going into the event may have been overdone, leading to a sell-the-news decline in the stock after the event concluded.September has been a wild month for Tesla stock, with shares regularly rising and falling sharply. Going forward, it wouldn't be surprising to see even more of this volatility. Following the stock's 1,000% gain between August 2019 and August 2020, a bumpy road ahead is almost inevitable.Investors will now look for Tesla to begin executing on the battery breakthroughs it announced on Tuesday.

Bets of a stable economic rebound from a pandemic-driven recession, combined with historic fiscal and monetary stimulus, had driven a rally in the three main U.S. stock indexes since March.However, doubts over the next coronavirus relief bill as well as a selloff in heavyweight technology-related stocks have weighed on investor sentiment this month, with Wall Street favorites including Facebook Inc FB.O, Apple Inc AAPL.O and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O bearing the brunt of the losses.\"It's just this constant push-and-pull in the face of uncertainty where we're waiting on information about the election, earnings and stimulus,\" said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital LLC in New York.Seven of the 11 major S&P indexes were down in morning trading, with energy .SPNY leading declines.

      "Haber:  SHANGHAI, Sept 22 (Reuters) - China's first exchange-traded funds (ETFs) investing in Shanghai's Nasdaq-style STAR Market attracted around 100 billion yuan ($14.8 billion) on Tuesday, the asset managers behind them said, five times their target.The scramble for the four ETFs tracking the STAR50 index .STAR50 suggest undiminished retail appetite for technology stocks, despite Washington's escalating \"tech war\" with Beijing and bodes well for Ant Group's upcoming listing.The STAR50 ETFs launched by China Asset Management Co (ChinaAMC), E Fund Management Co, Huatai-PineBridge Fund Management Co and ICBC Credit Suisse Asset Management Co, had each aimed to raise as much as 5 billion yuan.\"Over the long-term, STAR Market will likely become China's Nasdaq, breeding a large group of world-leading Chinese technology giants,\" Zhang Hongtao, fund manager at ChinaAMC, said during an online presentation promoting its STAR50 ETF.Although STAR50 trades at 80 times earnings, compared with 36 times for Nasdaq, fund managers promoting the ETFs say such conventional yardsticks miss the point.Citing U.S. electric carmaker Tesla TSLA.O, Liu Jun, fund manager at Huatai-PineBridge, said in a live roadshow that static valuation methods do not reflect the potential \"explosive\" growth of tech firms.ETFs offer retail investors easy access to the STAR Market, where the investment threshold is high, and exposure to China's top technology companies.Ant, which plans to list simultaneously in Hong Kong and on Shanghai's STAR Market, is expected to be included in the STAR50 next March, ChinaAMC fund manager Rong Ying said.ChinaAMC, the country's biggest ETF manager, attracted over 40 billion yuan of subscription money. E Fund drew in nearly 28 billion yuan while Huatai-PineBridge and ICBC Credit Suisse roughly 20 billion and 9 billion yuan respectively, the companies said, adding that the figures were not final.($1 = 6.7736 Chinese yuan renminbi)(Reporting by Samuel Shen and Andrew Galbraith; Editing by Alexander Smith)((samuel.shen@thomsonreuters.com;  +86 21 20830018; Reuters Messaging: samuel.shen.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\n",

      "Haber:  Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk threw some cold water on investor excitement leading up to the automaker's Tuesday evening battery event, warning the company's new technologies will take time to scale.Tesla shares are up 115% over the past three months in part on growing anticipation about what will be announced at the company's battery event. Investors are hoping that new, improved batteries and manufacturing processes can give Tesla a competitive advantage against a slew of new electric vehicle competition from traditional automakers and start-ups.Image source: Tesla.Tesla is also shifting away from individual parts riveted together on an assembly line and to a single component made using the world's largest aluminum casting machine. Musk has long talked of generating cost savings by automating the entire production line, which in years past he referred to as an \"alien dreadnought\" that would help him to reinvent auto manufacturing processes.But on Twitter Monday night, Musk noted how difficult it is to quickly scale up to mass production, saying he does not expect the products to be announced to hit mass production until 2022.Important note about Tesla Battery Day unveil tomorrow. This affects long-term production, especially Semi, Cybertruck & Roadster, but what we announce will not reach serious high-volume production until 2022.\n",
      "\"The extreme difficulty of scaling production of new technology is not well understood. It's 1000% to 10,000% harder than making a few prototypes,\" Musk wrote in a follow-up tweet. \"The machine that makes the machine is vastly harder than the machine itself.\"Though Musk says the challenges Tesla faces are not well understood, his words likely ring true to other automakers. Car companies typically spend years prototyping new designs to work out manufacturing kinks before reaching mass production.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "Haber:  By Marc JonesLONDON, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Europe's stock markets clawed back some ground on Tuesday, a day after rising second waves of the coronavirus epidemic caused the region's biggest wipeout since June and drove investors back to government bonds.Conditions were still choppy with South Korea and China pulling Asia down for a second day and tech-heavy Nasdaq now out of its recent stellar range, so it was a relief for traders to see Europe and U.S. futures stabilise.The pan-European STOXX 600 index .STOXX made back 0.5% of the 3.2% it lost on Monday, helped by respective 1% and 1.3% gains for the tech .SX8P and car sectors .SXAP that offset bumpier rides elsewhere. .EUTravel and leisure stocks saw 0.3% falls to add to Monday's 5.2% plunge and S&P futures were also a touch weaker. As investors stayed close to safety, yields on Germany's government bonds held near six-week lows and the dollar inched up =USD. GVD/EUR\"The market may be taking a breather but I would be surprised if that was it,\" said Rabobank's Head of Macro Strategy, Elwin de Groot, referring to Monday's rout that came as countries had been forced to reintroduce some of the COVID-19 restrictions they removed over the summer.\"The market won't like it. The base case was that the second wave wouldn't be as bad as the first... but the fourth quarter will be now another quarter with stringent restrictions and there are going to be an increasing number of economic victims,\" he said.Concerns had surfaced in the currency market, with both the euro EUR= and Britain's pound falling as much as 0.3% GBP= against the dollar.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson told Britons on Tuesday to go back to working from home, along with new curbs on pubs, bars and restaurants that he said could be in place for as long as six months without some form of COVID vaccine. This came as France saw its seven-day daily rolling case count rise above 10,000 for the first time over the weekend, Madrid had called in the army, Italy introduced more mandatory testing and Germany described the situation as \"worrying\".Beyond the impact of the virus, Hong Kong shares of HSBC 0005.HK and Standard Chartered 2888.HK had weakened a further 2%, after leaked reports showed they were among global lenders that have transferred more than $2 trillion in suspect funds over nearly two decades. \"Markets globally have run hard on the weight of huge liquidity, so it's not surprising to see a pullback in some valuations,\" said James Rosenberg, an EL&C Baillieu adviser in Sydney.\"Add in uncertainty with U.S. elections and another COVID wave in Europe ... it unsettles investors.\"TECH TESTWall Street's premarket gainers included Microsoft MSFT.O, Apple AAPL.O, Amazon AMZN.O and Alphabet GOOGL.O, all of which have dominated the global market rebound from its coronavirus-driven crash in March.Tesla TSLA.O skidded 3.4% though after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk warned about the difficulties of speeding up production.U.S. stocks have tumbled over the past three weeks as investors have pulled back from the tech surge while JPMorgan JPM.N and Bank of New York Mellon BK.N fell 3.1% and 4.0% respectively on Monday too .Concerns are also growing about a delay in U.S. stimulus measures as Congress remains deadlocked for weeks over the size and shape of another coronavirus-response bill, on top of the roughly $3 trillion already enacted into law.The weekend death of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg appeared to make the passage of another package less likely before the Nov. 3 presidential election, sparking large declines in the healthcare sector.Back in Europe, Italy's borrowing costs fell to multi-month lows on Tuesday on a perceived reduction in political risk as right-wing opposition leader Matteo Salvini had failed to make the breakthroughs he had hoped for in regional elections. GVD/EURThe results of the Sept. 20-21 vote, released late on Monday, were a boost to the fragile coalition government which is battling with the economic slump sparked by the coronavirus.In the commodity markets, gold fell against the firmer dollar to trade at $1,908.76 per ounce, while Brent oil LCOc1 gained 0.4% to $41.65 having lost $2 on Monday and U.S. crude CLc1 rose 0.5% to $39.5 per barrel.

      "Haber:  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmid the insane race that is the electric vehicle market, Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) has always been a “dumb money” venture. Simply on the basis of competing – cheekily, I might add – against Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), the upstart was always going to have its detractors. However, a damning report by notorious short-seller Hindenburg Research blunted momentum in Nikola stock.Source: Stephanie L Sanchez / Shutterstock.com\n",
      "\t\n",
      "In the extensive report, Hindenburg accused Nikola founder and executive chairman Trevor Milton with concocting an intricate fraud. One of the most damaging accusations was that management knew its Nikola One electric semi-truck wasn’t functional, yet Milton marketed the innovation as a working prototype.Combined with what Hindenburg perceived as a weak response from Nikola, the short seller is even more convinced about Milton committing securities fraud.Obviously, this isn’t a great look for Nikola stock, which has courted all kinds of accusations regarding deceptive business practices. But what’s curious, though, is that the underlying company was allegedly able to deceive automotive giants like General Motors (NYSE:GM).A few days before Hindenburg’s devastating report, GM took a $2 billion stake in Nikola. Specifically, the deal allows NKLA “to exchange $2 billion in newly issued stock for services and access to GM’s parts and components.” In a statement, GM will “engineer, homologate, validate and manufacture the Nikola Badger battery electric and fuel cell versions.”While this is a credibility boost for Nikola stock, auto experts pointed out that this deal is almost completely one-sided in favor of GM. Basically, the agreement is initially cashless. Should Nikola go down with criminal charges, it will only look bad from an optics perspective.Though an understandable argument, bad optics is exactly what General Motors doesn’t need.It wasn’t that long ago that GM drew the ire of the American public. To quickly recap, a defect in the ignition switch caused GM cars with the structural vulnerability to accidentally shut down. With the engine turned off, the airbag deployment system was essentially useless, leading to severe injuries and fatalities.Sadly, the latter was the case for Brooke Melton. According to AtlantaMagazine.com, Melton’s car was a key piece of evidence that her parents used in a lawsuit against GM. For the once-proud American icon, it was a deeply scandalous event that left a scar on the organization.Definitely, I understand the argument that on paper, General Motors is the biggest winner with its NKLA deal. Basically, Nikola will pay GM to build its EVs. If Nikola stock goes to zero, for instance, it’s not a waste for the automotive giant. Instead, the company would have gleaned valuable research and development in a new-to-them platform.And while NKLA is solvent, the upstart will pay GM to do what it would have done anyways: build EVs to start seriously competing against Tesla. Therefore, from this perspective, it’s all win and no lose for GM. That might explain why GM executives failed to perform due diligence on Trevor Milton and his Nikola unicorn. Also, GM rival Ford (NYSE:F) has aggressively jumped into the EV space, necessitating a response.Frankly, I can’t say for certain one way or the other. But the problem with this argument is that it assumes GM doesn’t care about its reputation. In my opinion, the company has every incentive to due diligence the living snot out of Nikola.After a horrible scandal, the last thing GM needs is another one, especially because its rivals are upping their EV game.Despite the awful accusations against Nikola stock and the underlying business (many will argue a lack thereof), I believe NKLA is still worth a shot with dumb money. While I am concerned about the nearer-term impact, contrarians can take some confidence in two fundamental factors.One, EVs inherently do away with much of the mechanical complexities of combustion-engine cars. Mainly, a traditional “analog” car has about 30,000 components. On the other hand, an EV needs just 11,000 parts. This sidestepping of automotive mechanics has allowed companies like Nio (NYSE:NIO) to flourish.Two, the EV market, once fully fleshed out, will be more than big enough to accommodate multiple competitors. Of course, a key distinguisher in this arena is automotive design. In my opinion, Nikola’s flagship Badger has the right mix of familiarity and futuristic elements. And if it accelerates according to its marketed specifications, it should convert many gearheads.Again, none of this is to suggest that Nikola stock is a blue-chip investment. But as part of a speculation portfolio, I think NKLA has the potential to positively surprise.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in NKLA and F.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

      "Haber:  Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) jumped on Friday, rising about 6% at market open. As of 10:00 a.m. EDT, the stock was up about 4%.The growth stock's gain followed an analyst's upgrade. In addition, shares are gaining back some of the losses from a sharp downturn in yesterday's stock price.A look inside Tesla's Megapack energy storage system. Image source: Tesla.Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter boosted his 12-month price target on Tesla stock from $480 to $515.The heightened view for Tesla comes after an analysis of the company's energy business and Elon Musk's compensation package -- factors that are generally \"poorly understood\" but are also becoming increasingly material for the company, explains Potter. Regarding Tesla's energy business, which includes energy storage and solar power product, \"We anticipate sharply higher demand for these products,\" Potter said. Shares have recovered some lost ground from yesterday, when the stock fell along with a broader market sell-off of many technology growth stocks.Tesla saw a nice 26% sequential uptick in energy generation and storage revenue in Q2, with segment sales coming in at $370 million. Notably, Tesla said in its quarterly update that demand was robust enough for its commercial-scale energy storage product Megapack, that the company remains production-constrained with the product.While this business is only a fraction of Tesla's $6 billion of total revenue during the quarter, CEO Elon Musk thinks Tesla Energy will eventually become as big as its automotive business. 10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "Haber:  You're feeling pretty good as a Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ: PTON) bull these days. The stock has nearly tripled in 2020, moving higher again on Thursday when most of the market went the other way. Bears aren't buying it. They argue Peloton is overvalued, its product overhyped, and that competition will eat them alive. The naysayers have been saying that all the way up, so let's poke some holes in some of the more common bearish missives. Image source: Peloton Interactive.One of the more intriguing moves by Peloton this month is that it lowered its entry-level price points. Its flagship $2,245 stationary bike got marked down to $1,895 on Sept. 9. Peloton also unveiled that its $4,295 treadmill will be joined a cheaper $2,495 model. Lowering prices isn't typically an encouraging sign. It results in lower margins and the sense that a company's hearing footsteps or facing waning demand. Thankfully for Peloton that's not the case at all. Even before announcing the new pricing strategy -- and it bears pointing out that Peloton did also introduce a more expensive $2,495 Bike+ -- the fast-pedaling at-home fitness specialist was telling new buyers they would have to wait several weeks for their purchases. The backlog is real. Peloton closed out its latest quarter with customer deposits and deferred revenue quadrupling to $363.6 million over the past year. Peloton introducing a cheaper treadmill and lowering the price of its signature bike is part of a brilliant barbell pricing strategy with its hardware. Was Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) desperate when it began introducing more affordable electric vehicles? Is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) a chump for keeping lower-priced iOS gadgetry around? You know the answer. You know what Peloton is doing here. It's making a play for the broader market. There are 3.1 million members on Peloton's platform, and with its nearly $22.6 billion in enterprise value that translates into investors paying more than $7,000 per Peloton member, a sky-high number -- and it gets worse. That figure includes the 316,800 members without Peloton hardware on cheaper digital workout subscriptions, and other additional members. Peloton's bread-and-butter connected fitness subscription platform is at 1.09 million, and using that as a measuring stick we're at a market cap of roughly $21,000 per subscriber.This is certainly a difficult multiple to justify without coloring out the entire page, but it's an easy target for skeptics. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) commands an enterprise value that translates to just a little more than $1,160 per paying streaming account. The New York Times (NYSE: NYT) with its 6.5 million -- largely digital -- total subscribers and its modest $6.3 billion enterprise value clocks in slightly less than Netflix at just below $1,000 per subscriber.Is a Peloton subscriber really worth about about 20 times a Netflix or New York Times subscriber? Hold off on shaking your head until you play this out. How many subscribers would Netflix or The New York Times have if they had to make a four-figure initial outlay for access to the platform -- in Peloton's case one of its bikes or treads? How many Netflix or New York Times digital subscribers would there be if they matched Peloton at $39 a month? Not every subscriber is the same. Peloton users are far more loyal than those on the Netflix or New York Times platforms. Peloton's 12-month retention rate is a lofty 92%. Its average net monthly connected fitness churn is just 0.75%. Netflix stopped providing its churn eight years ago, back when it was largely a DVDs-by-mail service. It was losing about half of its subscriber base every year. It's a lot easier to cancel Netflix and The New York Times in the digital world. Then we have growth and what that means for the future. Revenue soared 172% in Peloton's latest quarter, compared to an increase of 25% at Netflix and a decline of 8% at The New York Times. To be fair, the slide at The New York Times is about a decline in ad revenue more than offsetting positive gains on the subscription front. Either way, Peloton expects to top 2 million connected fitness subscribers a year from now -- so that lofty multiple will be shaved in half if the stock marches in place. Netflix and The New York Times should be able to post modest subscriber growth in that time, but it won't be anything like what we will see with Peloton.Apple's media event this week included the unveiling of Apple Fitness+, a low-priced platform that some are comparing to Peloton. It's not fair. Apple Fitness+ is a closer match to Peloton's smaller digital subscription platform, and in Apple's case its addressable market is limited to Apple Watch and iPhone owners. Peloton's competitively priced digital memberships are platform agnostic. This is going to be a competitive market with high account turnover for all players without the four-figure tethers of hardware ownership. It's not a threat to Peloton's bread-and-butter connected subscriber business.Some may also argue that Peloton's business won't be as popular or necessary once it's safe to return to the creature comforts of the gym or spinning class boutique. Don't bet on it. Peloton's momentum is fierce, and glowing word of mouth is driving the spike in orders. You don't catch up to Peloton; you just hope that you're not in its way. The same can be said about the now proven growth stock that Peloton has become. Good luck staying bearish. You're probably going to need it.10 stocks we like better than Peloton InteractiveWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

But in fact, the opposite seems to be true.Tesla stock plunged 7.6% in very early trading this morning, and as of 9:55 a.m. EDT, shares remained down 3.9%.Image source: Getty Images.Presumably, the broad-based sell-off in tech stocks this morning (the Nasdaq was down 1.5%) has something to do with it. But the Battery Day preview that analysts at Baird just released may also be giving investors cause for concern.In an exercise in guesswork related by StreetInsider.com this morning, Baird predicts that when Tesla pulls the veil off its Battery Day plans, it might reveal any of (a) a new low-cost cell, (b) a \"significant\" increase in battery production capacity, or (c) deeper moves into stationary energy-storage management for homeowners and utilities.Or perhaps (d) all of the above.Also, a new Tera battery factory in Fremont, California, is reportedly working on a battery twice the diameter of its current automotive battery cells, and Tesla has patent applications for a new, denser battery. You might think that either of these developments, along with Baird's predictions, would excite Tesla investors in the run-up to Battery Day.The problem is, Baird itself does not seem excited by any of the above. After musing publicly on all the things Tesla might reveal to us next week, the analyst concluded by rating the stock only neutral, and with a $332 price target that implies a 23% downside.Killjoy.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "Haber:  By Norihiko ShirouzuSept 16 (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N is set to announce plans on Wednesday to put into production an interchangeable \"family\" of electric vehicle (EV) drive systems and motors, boosting manufacturing  efficiencies as it transitions to a fully electric lineup.The move, which follows earlier GM initiatives on next-generation batteries, comes as the Detroit automaker looks to build a vertically integrated electric car business, comparable to Tesla TSLA.O, inside its ongoing operations. According to a GM media release viewed by Reuters, the automaker is set to announce that it has designed and plans to produce on its own five interchangeable drive units and three motors, which it calls the \"Ultium Drive\" system.GM said its new electric drive systems, sometimes referred to as e-axles in the industry, will have a versatile enough power output to allow them to be used with vehicles ranging from beefy pickup trucks to performance vehicles.GM already has some EV partnerships, such as with truck startup Nikola Corp NKLA.O, but has chosen here to design its own e-drive technology, rather than buy from suppliers that might be able to offer greater scale and lower cost.Adam Kwiatkowski, GM's executive chief engineer for global electrical propulsion, said that by designing its own e-axles, GM could better integrate them with an EV's battery and the rest of the car. E-axles combine gear, motor and power electronics into a single system and help convert the electricity from batteries efficiently to propel the vehicle.GM \"designed these drive units simultaneously with a full gambit of electric vehicles that fill out our portfolio,\" Kwiatkowski told Reuters in an interview last week.\"They become synergistic and make them a really efficient package that's good for the performance of the vehicle, good for driving customer enthusiasm, and most importantly it's good for cost efficiency,\" he said.The new self-designed technology means \"more of the battery energy now goes to the road\", which helps make GM's EVs more economical, Kwiatkowski said.That in turn meant GM could give its EVs greater driving range, or vehicles could have less batteries, he added.Other benefits include size, leading to a smaller drive train and more room for passengers, and also a more spontaneous motor response, Kwiatkowski said.\"There is very very little, totally imperceptible motor lag, so as soon as you touch the accelerator pedal the vehicle responds in a very smooth fashion.\"The new technology highlights GM's effort to transform itself and catch up with Tesla, whose share price has jumped over 400% this year as it has reported improved profitability.GM will still consider purchasing drive units and components from suppliers in some cases, said Detroit-based company spokesman, Phil Lienert.However, it will continue to lead the design, development and manufacturing of Ultium Drive units, he said.(Reporting By Norihiko Shirouzu; editing by Richard Pullin)((Norihiko.Shirouzu@thomsonreuters.com;))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\n",

      "Haber:  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs I write on Workhorse Group (NASDAQ:WKHS), I am reminded of a fiscal year 2016 article on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) that was published in the Time Magazine as it provides salient context for WKHS stock.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n",
      " The article focused on the reason “why investors are being so patient with Elon Musk.” The key reason was that investors were looking for what’s coming few years down the line than the present earnings or cash burn. TSLA stock has paid for investor patience with stellar returns generated in the recent past.Workhorse Group is another name in the electric vehicle business that deserves a closer look and potential exposure. Even after a big rally of 970% in the last six months. The reason: I believe that the growth journey has just started for the company. WKHS stock might correct after a massive rally. However, corrections would be an opportunity for fresh exposure.Investors would still be wary of a stock that has skyrocketed in the recent past. So, let’s look at some valuation insight. WKHS stock currently has a market capitalization of $2.5 billion.Back in June 2020, Formidable Asset Management LLC opined that WKHS stock is undervalued. The hedge fund noted that the company’s 10% stake in Lordstown Motors could be potentially valued at $1.0 billion “even if the market views Lordstown as only half as valuable as Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA).”Therefore, if the stake is as valuable as Nikola, the 10% investment would be valued at $2 billion. Clearly, a current market capitalization of $2.5 billion is not expensive. As the company’s business grows, the stock has significant scope for upside.I believe that Workhorse Group is at an inflection point and top-line growth will accelerate in the coming years.Skeptics will immediately point to the fact that the company signed an agreement with United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) in April 2012. This was an initial agreement to electrify UPS delivery trucks. However, eight years down the line, only six orders have been placed totaling 1,345 vehicles. The scalability of the business can therefore be questioned.The key reason is that there has been a gradual progress in development of charging infrastructure and lowering of charging cost over the years. Finally, the industry is at a point where delivery truck orders are poised to accelerate.A recent article in The New York Times perfectly sums up this view:“Now that battery technology is catching up to ambitions, many companies are making big commitments to electrify the last delivery mile…The rush to electrify, prompted by concern about climate change, a chance to offset growing delivery costs, government regulation and big advances in battery technology, is occurring as the coronavirus pandemic has caused a huge spike in package delivery.”WKHS stock surging in the recent past is because of these potential changes. The company is expecting a $6.3 billion contract from U.S. Postal Service for 165,000 vehicles. Any positive development on this possible contract can send the stock skyrocketing.Workhorse Group also claims of validation from blue-chip customers and partners. Some of the names include United Parcel Service, FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), Ryder System (NYSE:R) and DHL. These partnerships can translate into contracts in the coming years as EV truck adoption gains traction.From a manufacturing perspective, the company already has the ability to produce more than 60,000 vehicles on an annual basis. The company is therefore positioned to execute bigger orders.Coming back to the company’s 10% stake in Lordstown Motors: The management has mentioned in the second quarter 2020 conference call that LMC has already received 27,000 pre-orders for a potential revenue of $1.4 billion.Further, LMC has the capacity to produce 600,000 electric vehicles annually. Therefore, once production commences in FY2021, the stake can itself be a game-changer for the company.In addition, the company’s C-Series trucks can help in increasing the order backlog as companies increasingly adopt electric vehicles for last-mile delivery. The company believes that there is a total addressable market of $18 billion for delivery vehicles in the U.S. With the license to sell vehicles in all 50 states, Workhorse Group is well positioned for growth.Overall, WKHS stock is attractive and the best part of growth is still to come for the company. With the positive catalysts discussed, the stock can be considered for exposure on any potential correction from current levels.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.Faisal Humayun is a senior research analyst with 12 years of industry experience in the field of credit research, equity research and financial modelling.

      "Haber:  Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) rose on Tuesday, bolstered by a competitor's struggles and excitement surrounding its upcoming \"Battery Day\" presentation. As of 11:20 a.m. EDT, Tesla stock was up more than 6%.Reports that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating rival electric-vehicle maker Nikola (NASDAQ: NKLA) for allegations of fraud are likely helping to prop up Tesla's shares. In a scathing report on Thursday, short-seller Hindenburg Research accused Nikola of lying to investors about the true state of its battery technology and vastly overstating its progress toward the development of its electric truck.Tesla's stock rallied on Tuesday on news that a rival is being probed by the SEC. Image source: Getty Images.After Nikola responded to some of Hindenburg's claims on Monday, Hindenburg then argued its response was a \"tacit admission of securities fraud.\" Should the SEC agree with Hindenburg's view, or if its investigation uncovers other instances of wrongdoing, Nikola's ability to compete effectively in the electric vehicle market could be severely weakened.As its competitor wrestles with fraud allegations, Tesla is gearing up for its \"Battery Day\" on Sept. 22. Investors are looking forward to seeing what new technologies CEO Elon Musk unveils during his presentation. Excitement has been rising for Tesla's battery-related growth opportunity, as fears surrounding climate change are bolstering demand for electric vehicles and clean energy storage solutions around the world. Judging by the recent gains, many investors are choosing to buy Tesla's stock ahead of the event in anticipation of Musk's forthcoming announcements.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "Haber:  By Ben KlaymanDETROIT, Sept 15 (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N is exploring options in the aerial taxi market, including whether to build the vehicles known colloquially as \"flying cars,\" as part of a push by the U.S. automaker to look for growth in related transportation markets, two people familiar with the matter said.Chief Executive Mary Barra on Monday briefly made her first reference ever to Detroit-based GM's interest in the air taxi market, saying that it fit with development of electric vehicles (EVs) and its Ultium advanced electric battery.\"We believe strongly in our EV future and not just for vehicles,\" she said at an RBC conference. \"The strength and flexibility of our Ultium battery system opens doors\" for many uses, she added, \"including aerial mobility.\"Air taxis are vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft that use electric motors instead of jet engines. Designed to avoid the need for long runways, they have rotating wings and, in some cases, rotors in place of propellers.Electric air taxis are likely to fly low-level routes, relieving traffic congestion on roads. But they could add to air traffic congestion as they become more popular.GM spokesman Stuart Fowle declined to elaborate. \"It's an area we're really excited about and looking at.\"GM shares were up almost 2% in midday trading.  Corporate and private investors have poured at least $2.3 billion into more than 100 aerial vehicle startups, including drones and electric air taxis, but the technology still faces significant roadblocks to commercialization and profitability, according to investor website PitchBook.GM is weighing all options - whether to build, supply or partner - as it decides whether to join such automakers as Hyundai Motor Co005380.KS, Toyota Motor Corp7203.T, Daimler AG DAIGn.DE, Volkswagen AGVOWG_p.DE and Geely Automobile 0175.HK in the still-developing market, said the sources, who asked not to be identified. GM could make an announcement early next year.GM's study of the aerial mobility market is part of the push by GM's innovation group to explore other transportation markets for growth, one of the sources said. The group is headed by Alan Wexler, who reports to Barra and was hired in July in the newly created position of senior vice president of innovation and growth.Other efforts that originated in the innovation group include formation of a defense business unit and a $214 million contract to build troop carriers for the U.S. Army based on the Chevrolet Colorado pickup, as well as a new mobile app for OnStar members. Hyundai teamed up with Uber Technologies Inc UBER.N in January to develop electric air taxis and has pledged to invest $1.5 billion in urban air mobility by 2025. Toyota led a $590 million investment round in air taxi startup Joby in January, while Daimler and Geely have invested in Stuttgart-based Volocopter. Volkswagen's Porsche brand is working with BoeingBA.N to develop a concept electric flying vehicle. Last year, TeslaTSLA.O CEO Elon Musk called electric supersonic VTOL a \"hard problem,\" and last month said a more powerful battery that could enable electric airplanes was three to four years away. Musk has said \"many exciting things\" will be unveiled during Tesla's Battery Day on Sept. 22.

      "Haber:  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIncreasingly and if Covid-19 has taught us anything, it’s hard to live without Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). But as an investment right now, off and on the price chart, AMZN stock looks better-suited for investors to place a risk-adjusted, deep discount delivery of shares. Let me explain.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n",
      "\t\n",
      "Monday was a nice start to the workweek for the leading Nasdaq Composite. Following last week’s corrective 4% hit and total decline of 11% in just six trading sessions, bargain-hunting assisted by raised Covid-19 vaccine hopes took the market index up 1.83%.Gains in the tech-heavy bellwether were led by strong and influential rallies in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which tacked on 3%, and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which soared higher 12.58% by the session’s close. But multifaceted, stay-at-home stock Amazon was conspicuously left out of the rally as shares finished off 0.43%.Not that AMZN stock was totally alone. Trillion-dollar plus peer Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) saw similar pressure. And Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) only managed a subpar gain of 0.63%. Still, rather than misery simply loving company, what was behind the weakness in Amazon shares? Seasonality? A harder-to-defend valuation, or lingering fears of elevated U.S.-China trade war risks? Any may have played a part in Amazon’s refusal to rally, but there was news too.A report that Deutsche Telekom (OTCMKTS:DTEGY) is partnering with France’s OVHcloud to take on Amazon’s AWS and Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing platforms may have had investors’ attention Monday. At the same time, investors seemingly ignored upbeat news Amazon is set to hire 100,000 additional warehouse and operations employees this year. Was this a case of picking and choosing contrasting catalysts? Or were both headlines ignored altogether? At the end of the day, we’ll never know with any certainty.One thing we do know is that stocks break ranks with the broader market all the time. Sometimes it’s bearish. What’s more, this kind of price action includes even the best stay-at-home and most dearly held stocks like Amazon. Sometimes that divergence can lead to larger corrective cycles that might trim up to 30% from the valuation of companies of AMZN stock’s caliber. In a bearish market environment those losses can easily be magnified, too. Today Amazon stock’s correction stands at 13% compared to the Nasdaq’s 11%. So, what’s the next move for investors?\n",
      "Source: Charts by TradingViewA larger correction that may just be underway has additional backing from the weekly AMZN stock chart. Following a critical weekly doji decision candle that hit all-time highs and briefly broke a steep uptrend line, shares confirmed lower prices with a bearish shooting star pattern this past week.Near-term, with stochastics just entering oversold territory and showing no indications of the stock bottoming, a much deeper correction and even a bear market into Fibonacci support zone is gaining credibility. Were that to happen and based on Amazon’s March low to September high, shares could test an area from roughly $2,400 – $2,800 before a meaningful intermediate-term rally emerges.For now, the advice is to stay on the sidelines rather than purchase Amazon stock. In a month or two, the possibility for higher prices is there. Right now though, significant downside risk has grown and should be respected until a stronger low in shares forms. That’s not to say investors can’t gain smarter exposure to AMZN stock today using the options market.In lieu of our outlook, one favored strategy using Amazon’s options is to combine bullish out-of-the-money, intermediate-term call and put verticals. By joining these type of spreads, investors can position today with defined and reduced risk amid the raised chance of a larger correction, while maintaining bullish exposure to the upside. Bottom-line, this is one strategy where investors can truly have their cake and eat it too.On the date of publication, Chris Tyler did not hold, directly or indirectly, positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.Chris Tyler is a former floor-based, derivatives market maker on the American and Pacific exchanges.

      "Haber:  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNio (NYSE:NIO) stock continues its ascent despite the novel coronavirus pandemic. The Chinese EV maker recently recorded a robust second quarter. Even though it did not turn a profit, the company did enough for shares to skyrocket.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n",
      "\t\n",
      "And don’t get me wrong, there are several catalysts for Nio stock that investors will be happy with. The Chinese government is hoping that NEVs will represent one-fifth of new auto sales by 2025. As of 2019, electric vehicles accounted for almost 5% of the Chinese vehicle market. Hence the target is ambitious and presents a tremendous opportunity for companies like Nio.However, much like its counterpart Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), shares are highly valued. Nio stock is trading at 11.6x forward enterprise value-sales, while the sector trades at 1x. I fully understand and appreciate the excitement surrounding the EV sector.However, it’s tough to justify the valuations at which some of the players in the space are trading. Nio has just started to gather steam and there are still several competitors that pose a significant challenge to the long-term progress of the company.That’s not to say Nio stock is not a good one to have in your portfolio. But I would wait for it to cool off before loading up.As mentioned, things are looking up for Nio. In the second quarter, the company posted its best numbers despite contending with a global pandemic. The numbers are aided by the quicker-than-expected recovery in China. Second-quarter deliveries came to 10,331 vehicles, a 191% jump over 2019. Revenues came in at $526.4 million, beating analyst estimates of $504 million by a handy margin.Any way you slice it, Q2 was a quarter filled to the brim with milestones. It marked the first time deliveries exceeded 10,000 vehicles, gross margins entered positive territory, and operating cash flow was positive. Long term investors must be smiling from ear to ear, as Nio finally has the figures to back its progress as an early-stage growth company.Forecasts are for deliveries to rise between 11,000 and 11,500 vehicles in Q3. Third-quarter revenue is projected to fall between 4,047.5 million yuan and 4,212.3 million yuan, handily outpacing the year-ago figure of 1,836.8 million yuan.The astounding earnings report notwithstanding, other external aspects should instill confidence in Nio investors. The Chinese government is particularly keen on reducing average fuel consumption to 4 liters per 100km. Air quality and pollution are vital issues for Beijing and the government’s actions speak louder than words. Tax breaks on the purchase of NEVs have been extended by two years to 2022, and the Corporate Average Fuel Consumption and New Energy Vehicle credit program, or CAFC/NEV, is upgraded with added incentives for the NEV industry.With several tailwinds, you would think that there is nothing Nio can do wrong. A long-term growth strategy, government support, and a gargantuan local Chinese market all make for an unbeatable stock. While all correct, it doesn’t justify the premium valuation of at which Nio stock is trading.XPeng (NYSE:XPEV) recently had an IPO to a lot of fanfare, and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) built up a sizeable investment of up to 19% in the EV maker. With such a heavy investor backing its activities, XPeng has undoubtedly had a great kickoff, and there’s every likelihood that it will go from strength to strength from here.No mention of competition in the space would be complete without Tesla. Billionaire Elon Musk’s electric vehicle and clean energy giant will launch its Model Y in China soon. The launch is already a bit delayed by most accounts but will now challenge Nio’s EC6 in September. Although it may look like a very insular market, Nio is competing in a cut-throat sector. Tesla’s scale and size, along with its brand positioning, are already far ahead of Nio. It will be a tough battle moving forward for each percentage point of the sector.Nio stock is an excellent addition to any portfolio but its trading too hot at the moment. The markets are reacting positively to their growth potential. Investors are also rewarding Nio for their excellent financials and will continue to do so. But shares are overvalued, especially when you consider that Nio stock trades at multiples higher than Tesla.Refinitiv‘s 12-month price target for Nio stock is $113 a pop, with estimates going as low as $44 per share in a worst-case scenario. Still, even if we take the mean price target, we are left with a stock that is almost 3% overvalued at current prices. In my humble opinion, I would wait for shares to drop by at least 15% before loading up.On the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. Faizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

      "Haber:  Despite the COVID-19 pandemic and related shutdown, despite the shock to employment, despite the economic uncertainty globally, and despite a decade-long expansion, the stock market just keeps going up.The Wall Street Journal recently reported that the P/E ratio for the S&P 500 based on the trailing 12 months of earnings is 25.6, while the P/E based on forecast future earnings would be at levels that were last seen in the year 2000. Remember, 2000 was followed by a three-year market slump. The disproportionate nature of the market rally is even more concerning. Little more than 25% of stocks in the S&P 500 are actually up for the year. The bull run has been dependent on a small portion of stocks. Principally, tech has been the saving grace. Image source: Getty Images.While not all of the first- and second-quarter earnings reports from the various publicly traded companies have been as bad as some had anticipated, the multiples for some of the best performing names this year are staggering. Investors have rushed into any equities with pandemic growth potential.Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ: ZM) is a good example. The stock is up over 200% in the last six months; and that is after the pullback that we've seen over the last week or so. In relation, the company is only expecting adjusted full-year earnings of $2.40 to $2.47 per share. That means the stock is trading at roughly 165 times its full-year earnings forecast. Perhaps the biggest example of the disconnect between financial reality vs. market speculation is Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). The stock is up 338% even after its recent correction. The shares carry a market capitalization of just under $342 billion, while total equity on the balance sheet was $9.85 billion at the end of June. Think about that. Investors have $342 billion in an entity that is worth $9.85 billion in book value, and it is only now working toward what might be a slightly profitable year. There's a big tug and pull going on right now between stimulus and fundamentals. The measures being implemented to drive the economy (like low interest rates) make it difficult for investors to find big growth potential outside of equities. Low rates make bonds and Treasury notes a weak play. It also hinders financial institutions. Overall, investors have to look to the small number of growth names within the stock market to find returns.The stock market is not the economy. It is incredibly important to remember there is a disconnect between the two. The stock market is a speculative valuation market for components of the economy. Gross domestic product fell by 32.9% in the second quarter, while the S&P 500 climbed more than 500 points. That should pretty much showcase what I'm talking about.Consumer spending has been important for the U.S. economy. The unemployment shock has been tempered by the stimulus measures which included increased unemployment benefits and business loans. As The Wall Street Journal reported, consumer spending growth has gradually slowed over the last three months, going from 8.6% growth in May to 6.2% in June and 1.9% in July. It doesn't take a lot of thought to connect the decline with a decline in spending stimulus money. There is also debate over where the U.S. unemployment rate truly lies. Some have suggested that if you include the issues with data collection, combined with the part of the workforce that is not presently looking for work (a figure that the unemployment rate traditionally excludes), the actual unemployment rate for August could have been 11.1% rather than the reported 8.4%.Even with a rate of 8.4%, that is close to the levels the country was at during the low point of the Great Recession. As a whole, the number of people in the workforce is still down around 3.7 million compared to what it was before the COVID-19-related chaos began. Because the strength of the consumer is such an important factor in the U.S. economy, it's important to monitor these issues. While unprecedented stimulus bolstered a weak situation, the economy is not out of the woods yet. When everything costs an arm and a leg to buy, it's wise to be a little more selective. Economic factors have not kept up with the market's insane rally. It seems prudent to start considering a larger cash position. Being fully invested at a market high can lead to dilemmas down the road. It leaves you with no maneuvers if a market correction occurs. That in turn can lead to taking losses in order to free up capital. It is far better to have some cash to invest on the sidelines. It turns a pullback into a buying opportunity rather than a detriment.10 stocks we like better than WalmartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

      "Haber:  Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock treated its investors to a 330% increase in share price this. After such astounding performance, it's hard to imagine what it might take to make the stock more popular than it was already -- but Tesla eventually found a way to boost its popularity even more:On Aug. 31, Tesla split its stock.Image source: Getty Images.Tesla actually announced its stock split on Aug. 11, promising to give owners of Tesla stock five new shares for each share of the company they already owned. From the day the stock split was announced, to the day it actually happened, Tesla shares gained $223 in price -- an 81% return in 20 days!  Clearly, Tesla investors liked the idea of a stock split -- and maybe for good reason.Theoretically, stock splits should be non-events. Consider a hypothetical company \"X\" with 100 shares outstanding. Each share of X represents a 1% ownership interest in company X. Now, if X decides to split its stock 5-for-1, as Tesla did last month, the number of shares outstanding will quintuple to 500 -- but here's the crucial fact to remember:These shares still represent the same company they did before the split. It's just that ownership of the company has been split into 500 pieces instead of 100 pieces. A shareholder who owned one share prior to the split will own five shares after the split -- but 500 divided by 5 still equals just 1%.Similarly, a stock split doesn't make a company either more or less profitable (profits per share are divided into smaller pieces, but there are five times more pieces). It doesn't make the company grow any faster, either (because it's still the same company, just divided into more pieces).The math here is pretty clear, and yet, according to historical studies of stock splits conducted by the University of Illinois in 1996 and 2003, stocks that \"split\" tend to outperform the rest of the stock market by 8% in the first year after a split is announced -- and by a total of 12% over the next three years.  Why does this happen? Logically, it's because companies most often split their stock after the price has grown very high, and they want to make it look cheaper, and thus more accessible to investors.But the reason that a stock price gets high in the first place -- high enough that it might want to split -- is because the company is doing really well. Sales are up strongly. (Tesla's sales are up more than 5,000% over the last five years, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence). Profits are rising, too. (Five years ago, Tesla was losing nearly $900 million a year. Over the last 12 months, Tesla earned $368 million).In short, business was going great guns before the split -- and the stock probably would have powered higher whether the stock split happened or not!This brings us to our two splits to avoid, and one to watch.This month is going to be pretty active for stock splits, with Fidelity Research listing more than 20 companies conducting splits. But in contrast to Tesla's 5-for-1 split, most of the \"splits\" happening this month will see not one share divided into several, but many shares merged into one, in transactions known as \"reverse share splits.\"  Two stand out: Whiting Petroleum (NYSE: WLL), which merged every 49.426 of its old shares into one new share on Sep. 2, and Northern Oil and Gas (NYSEMKT: NOG), which will merge 10 shares of stock into one on Sep. 21.In each case, plummeting oil and gas prices have devastated profits this year, pushing profits deeply into the red. Shares prices fell into penny stock range, and in order to get their per-share stock prices up above the $1 required to remain listed on the stock market, these companies decided to bundle some shares together to get back over the price limit. If, for example, Northern Oil & Gas shares trade for $0.56 each today, then after a \"1-for-10\" split, new shares of NOG will sell for $5.60 each.But here's the downside to reverse stock splits: Because stock splits don't actually change the business, both Whiting and Northern Oil are likely to continue performing just as badly -- both as businesses and as stocks -- after their reverse split as before!Finally, let's now consider the opposite case -- a stock performing a bit less like Whiting and Northern Oil, and a bit more like Tesla. Trex (NYSE: TREX), the maker of \"fake wood\" products that have become so popular among folks quarantined at home and with lots of time on their hands for home improvements, has gone on a tear this year. Last quarter alone, sales at Trex grew 7% and profits grew 32% in the middle of the pandemic.Admittedly, these aren't Tesla-like growth rates, but they're good, and they've been good enough to send Trex stock up 48% so far this year. Trex's planned stock split -- 2-for-1, taking effect on Sep. 15 -- is therefore an example of the kind of stock split that should be good for investors.Just remember to get the order right: The stock is splitting because the business is doing well -- and not the other way around.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "Haber:  I took a look at three stocks to avoid last week, and I was right. All three stocks declined between 5% and 13%, checking in with an average slide of 9.7% for the holiday-abridged trading week. It wasn't a good week in general for Wall Street, but the market itself only suffered a 2.5% dip.Let's move to the week ahead, but first we bid farewell to a staple over the past month. Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA) spent the past four weeks on this list. I was early, figuring that the pre-split surge was getting out of hand. The electric car maker soared through the first two weeks before falling sharply the past two after the split went into effect. It was still a bad overall call. Tesla Motors rose 13% in the span of those four weeks. With a highly anticipated media event set for later this month, it's probably best for bears to stay on the sidelines. For this week, I see Herman Miller (NASDAQ: MLHR), Nikola (NASDAQ: NKLA), and Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE: NCLH) as vulnerable investments in the near term. Here's why I think these are three stocks to avoid this week.Image source: Getty Images.There aren't a lot of companies reporting fresh financials this week, but Herman Miller stands out as a potential troublemaker. The company behind high-end office furniture reports fiscal first-quarter results after Wednesday's close. Herman Miller isn't offering guidance these days, but Wall Street pros have an opinion. They see revenue sliding 22% in the report. If you think that's bad, the real red flag is that Herman Miller's has fallen short of analyst top-line estimates for three consecutive quarters. In short, recent history tells us that Wall Street's too high. The bottom line has been kinder -- consistently coming ahead of expectations over the past year -- but there's only so much more cost-cutting that Herman Miller can do at this point with its business going the wrong way.The pandemic exodus from executive offices will eat into Herman Miller's signature product orders, but the bullish counter here is that well-heeled managers working from home will want to duplicate the experience with Herman Miller's flagship chairs and accessories. The rub is that this didn't play out in a bullish way in the fiscal quarter ending in May with revenue also plunging by more than 20%. It's hard to be encouraged heading into this week's report.    Last week was pretty wild for Nikola and its shareholders. The stock initially soared after General Motors (NYSE: GM) announced that it was buying a $2 billion stake in the electric-truck start-up and teaming up to take Nikola's Badger pickup to market. Those gains evaporated as the week played out after noted short-seller Hindenberg Research called Nikola a lies-hyped fraud. The grim end result is that a stock that traded as much as 53% higher on Tuesday closed out the week with a 10% decline.There's a lot to unpack here. GM is getting a lot for its $2 billion stake, and that includes supplying the batteries and fuel cells that will go into the truck, validating the engineering of the vehicle, and building the vehicle. Nikola will fund these GM tasks, calling into question the start-up's proprietary tech claims. Nikola is going to be volatile. Wild swings are the norm, and that comes with the territory given the nature of its largely young base of Robinhood shareholders. Tesla Motors has made electric vehicles a hot niche for speculators, but at least Tesla has a long history of success with its growing product line. This will be a battleground stock in the near term, and until Nikola's founder can eviscerate Hindenberg's claims, it could be time to stage a retreat. Cruise line stocks have been inching higher in recent weeks on the hopes that a COVID-19 vaccine will hit the market sooner rather than later, something that would help put an end to the industry practice of pushing resumption dates deeper into the calendar. With the chances that a remedy will roll out in two months dimmed last week, it's time to take a more cautious stance.Norwegian Cruise Line continues to be the smallest of the three publicly traded players. It has raised less money during the lull to keep afloat, but it also needs less money given its smaller fleet and operations. The cruise industry isn't going to make a full recovery anytime soon, and if there's a shakeout, it's going to be the small fry that gets lost at sea. If you're looking for safe stocks, you aren't likely to find them in Herman Miller, Tesla Motors, or Norwegian Cruise Line this week. 10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "Haber:  Sept 11 (Reuters) - A rebound in Tesla Inc TSLA.O shares was set to extend into a third straight session on Friday, recouping more of a record 21% drop earlier this week that wiped $80 billion off the electric-car maker's market capitalization.Tesla shares were up 3.2% in trading before the bell, building on a 12.5% jump in the past two days in one of the most volatile weeks this year for technology-related stocks on Wall Street.The carmaker's dizzying 500% surge this year has come courtesy of improved headline results and a flood of money into technology-linked shares, but Wall Street analysts are still less convinced about the company's longer-term prospects.The median price target on the stock is $300 - well below its Sept. 1 record high of $502.49, according to Refinitiv data, and of the 33 analysts covering the stock, 15 rate it \"hold\" and 10 \"sell\" or lower.As investors look to \"Battery Day\" on Sept. 22 that is expected to showcase Tesla's latest improvements, the company still faces a long development path requiring huge investment if it is to durably challenge the world's biggest manufacturers.\"We (and the market) expect the announcements to be significant, cementing Tesla's cost and technology lead for several more years,\" UBS autos analyst Patrick Hummel wrote in a note, listing a series of announcements he expected from the day and doubling his price target to $325.\"(But) for as long as there is no big 'one more thing' on the agenda, we think all of the above is already fully discounted.\"Separately, sources told Reuters on Friday Tesla is planning to export Model 3 vehicles made in China to Asian and European markets. The automaker is expanding its manufacturing base in China to make Model Y sports-utility vehicles and adding lines to make more battery packs, electric motors and motor controllers.

      "Haber:  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs an investment writer, I’ve beaten up on my share of unprofitable companies that somehow enjoy robust stock runs. My favorite whipping boy for years was Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which somehow continued to climb and climb and climb some more, though profitable quarters were as rare as Martian spacecraft sightings. Now comes another electric vehicle company, Workhorse Group (NASDAQ:WKHS). And like Tesla shares, WKHS stock has enjoyed a way-huge rally underpinned by—yup—zero profit.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n",
      "\t\n",
      "The big action commenced sometime around June 3, when you could get a share of WKHS for $2.95 per share. Then in a month, the share price shot up to an all-time high of $20.91, an increase of more than 600%. Man, oh man and here’s what happened: At the end of June, Workhorse scored $70 million in financing cryptically referred to as “a single institutional investor” by the company.Noting cryptic, however, happened so far as Robinhood investors are concerned. Business Insider reported that in June (which should be dubbed the Month of the Workhorse), the number of Robinhood account owners who invested in Workhorse leaped more than 400% to 116,000.And yet, is that wise? By the numbers no, but by recent precedent and sector formation, perhaps.If we examine the period prior to the most recent jump, WKHS stock has an interesting history marked by two periods: a steady monster climb and a stomach-dropping dip. Between its 2014 debut and April 2016, its value multiplied by 10 times. Then after hitting a record high of $11.10, it shed 80% value and remained in $2 territory for the next three years. And for a time, it got worse—much worse—when the stock dipped as low as 51 cents per share in December 2018.Mr. Hindsight being the market genius he is, hail to those who bought back then: You’ve made more than 37 times your original investment. And no matter when you bought in the stock’s history, you’re in the green. So now comes the crystal-ball-gazing part. Will WKHS continue to rocket up? Or if you buy at this point, will you be doing exactly what investors shouldn’t do, and purchasing at peak? And we might repeat, staking your money on a company that has yet to turn a profit?I’m going to go a step further onto a limb in my analysis than fellow InvestorPlace writers Muslim Farooque and Will Ashworth. They both gave smart takes on WKHS stock and I encourage you to read their recent pieces. Farooque called Workhorse “a vulnerable investment, with an unclear path to profitability, ineffective intellectual properties and weak financials,” while Ashworth contended: “You absolutely shouldn’t touch this stock if profits and revenues are your things.”Yes, but any wager on WKHS stock is a wager on the electric vehicle sector itself. And unlike ride-hailing companies Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) and Uber (NYSE:UBER)—who are under constant assault for alleged unfair labor practices and have an easy-to-copy business model—electric vehicle companies are different. Their products can only grow in popularity and demand in the face of climate change and you can’t exactly build a manufacturing plant overnight.Workhorse is also carving out a nice niche for itself, making commercial vehicles such as C-series electric step vans. Ryder System (NYSE:R) recently bought three, and if the company falls in love with them, it could mean a bonanza for WHKS shareholders, as Ryder currently owns and leases 213,800 vehicles.And in that sense, unprofitability takes on different perspective, even if it can’t be outright ignored. Clearly, electric cars and delivery vehicles are as much on their way in as energy sector stocks are on the wane, and possibly on their way out.Profit track record? Yeah, there’s none. And just because a sector is new and exciting doesn’t mean it’s ready for Wall Street prime time; once again, Lyft and Uber immediately come to mind. Sexy looking? Check. The future of transport? Probably in some form. But worth your investment dollars? Sure, if you like to burn them.Then there’s Workhorse, which just reaffirmed previous production and delivery targets of 300 to 400 vehicles in 2020 in its Q2 report. Sales, though paltry at $92,000, are still up close to 17 times year-over-year. Meanwhile, Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch has just named WKHS a “buy.”“He calls the company a leader in last-mile delivery solutions and [has] established a new $23 price target for shares,” according to Barron’s.WKHS stock is way overvalued, of that there’s no question. But this may be one of the better bets you’ll make in 2020, so long as you watch your money closely, pay attention to the news…and ask Tesla investors what it’s like to develop nerves of steel.On the date of publication, Lou Carlozo did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.The post Workhorse Group Has No Gas In Its Tank, But Could Still Be Electric appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\n",

      "Haber:  To say that the stock market's rally has been impressive over the past few months would be a huge understatement. That's especially true when it comes to some of the most popular tech stocks in the market. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) are two in particular that many investors have made big profits on recently, but many other high-flying tech stocks have made investors tons of money in recent months.If you sold any of your big stock market winners after the recent rally and made a large profit, there could be some big implications when tax time rolls around. Here's a quick guide to what you need to know.Image source: Getty Images.The first question you need to answer is whether your sale is potentially a taxable event or not. Did you own the stock(s) you sold in a retirement account like an IRA, or did you own them in a standard (taxable) brokerage account?If you sold stocks you owned in a retirement account, then you don't have to worry -- unless you plan to withdraw the proceeds right away in a tax-deferred account like a traditional IRA. As long as you leave the money in the account, stock sales in retirement accounts are not subject to capital gains taxes, no matter how much profit was earned. For example, I recently sold half of my Apple stock at a substantial profit, but since the position was held in my solo 401(k) account, I won't have to worry about the tax implications until I withdraw money from the account.So, if you sold stocks at a profit in your retirement accounts, the short answer is that your 2020 tax return won't be affected unless you actually withdraw money.Assuming that you owned the stock(s) you sold in a taxable account, the next question is how long you owned them for.When it comes to capital gains tax, the IRS has two categories: short or long term. Here's the difference:In addition to these, some high-income investors pay an additional 3.8% net investment income tax regardless of the length of time the investment was held.It's also important to point out that investment profits aren't taxed on a stock-for-stock basis. The IRS assesses tax on your net capital gains for the year. In other words, investment losses can help offset investment gains.Consider this simplified example. Let's say that you just sold a bunch of Tesla stock at a $5,000 short-term profit. However, you also sold another stock at a $2,000 loss when the market crashed in March. You'd only have a $3,000 taxable gain.It's a bit more complex than this. For one thing, long-term losses must be used to offset long-term gains before they can be applied against short-term gains, and vice versa. And even if you don't have any capital gains, investment losses can be used to reduce your other taxable income by as much as $3,000.Furthermore, when the end of the year gets closer, you could revisit your portfolio to see if you're sitting on any losing investments you might want to sell to reduce your tax bill. This is actually a popular strategy known as tax-loss harvesting, and it can significantly lower your taxes on winning investments.As a final thought, you don't have to worry too much about calculating your capital gains by hand. Your broker will send you a tax form (typically a consolidated 1099) that contains your gains and losses, dividends, interest income, and more tax information.And here's the point you should really know: Your broker sends a copy of this form to the IRS as well. So, the IRS knows when you've made a big investment profit. Don't think that you can just not report it and avoid taxes. Failing to report a big investment gain is a quick way to get audited.The $16,728 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known \"Social Security secrets\" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. For example: one easy trick could pay you as much as $16,728 more... each year!

      "Haber:  LONDON, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Tesla TSLA.O shares edged up on Thursday in U.S. premarket trade, extending a recovery from this week's drop, but analysts see a bumpy ride ahead as an extreme build-up in derivative positions caps the stock and precludes a full rebound.The electric-car maker's shares were up roughly 2% at $373.50 in premarket trading, set for the second straight day of gains to follow the previous session's 11% rally.Tesla shares shed 21% on Tuesday - their biggest one-day percentage drop on record - after the stock’s surprise exclusion from the S&P 500 .SPX.The selloff early this week wiped out $75 billion dollars off the company's market value, exacerbated by the hedges built around massive betting on Tesla options by retail and institutional traders during the stock’s four-fold rise since March.\"All the excess buying in call options suddenly hit a critical mass and you had this inflection point last week,\" said Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank.The implied volatility on near-term Tesla options is ranging around 100%, luring a lot of speculators into cashing in through spread structures and potentially implying massive buying and selling of the stock in coming days.More than 1 million Tesla call options -- contracts that entitle buyers to buy the stock – have traded on average in the past three sessions, which is a more than 30% jump over volumes in recent weeks, a London-based trader said.Yet, the sudden surge in borrowing of Tesla shares by short sellers with 7% of outstanding shares being shorted suggests a tug of war between bulls and bears is in store.\"I think they (short sellers) are definitely smelling blood,\" Garnry said.Tesla is not alone. Apple AAPL.O and other major technology stocks have also seen their options volumes skyrocket and stock prices fall this week, with investors pointing to the massive options purchases by retail traders and the SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T as reasons for the August euphoria and the September pullback.\"It was a lesson learnt in risk management (for retail traders)... I think also the U.S. election now will be pulled into the arena as sort of the centre focus in terms of risk,\" Garnry added.He believes U.S. stocks could trade sideways from here.Wall Street’s biggest players, however, are viewing the tech-led selloff as a bout of turbulence rather than the start of a longer slide, and they don't see it as a reason to run for the door.

      "Haber:  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs if you needed more news about electric vehicle debuts, we have another one to discuss. Last month, DiamondPeak Holdings (NASDAQ:DPHC) generated headlines when it announced it will merge with electric pickup truck startup Lordstown Motors. The deal will take Lordstown public. Certainly, investors were enthusiastic about the potential of the company, resulting in DiamondPeak stock skyrocketing.Source: Alexandru Nika / Shutterstock.com\n",
      " As you probably know, DiamondPeak is a special purpose acquisition company or SPAC, essentially operating as shell companies without an underlying business.SPACs have been hot commodities this year, providing an alternative to the typical initial public offering. With DiamondPeak stock, investors have a process that is similar to Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA).Proponents of DiamondPeak stock will argue the two are distinct in that Lordstown has a more tangible path to revenue creation. Unlike other speculative EV plays, Lordstown plans to build its trucks late next year in a former General Motors (NYSE:GM) factory. Further, it has investments from GM, while Workhorse Group (NASDAQ:WKHS) owns a 10% stake.Put another way, while DiamondPeak stock is risky, the underlying company appears to have its fundamentals locked tight. Should you then take a shot at shares? Like anything involving new technology, it’s complicated.Here are two pros and two cons to consider.As I mentioned above, Lordstown already has tangible plans underway to manufacturer and distribute its electric pickup trucks. Again, while no one should mistake DiamondPeak stock as a surefire bet, management has laid out a viable business plan. Accordingly, Lordstown received 27,000 orders, representing $1.4 billion in potential revenue mostly from commercial fleet clients.According to a CNN report, Lordstown will sell the pickups at a starting price around $52,000. That competes reasonably well with other electric trucks. Yes, the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Cybertruck has a lower starting price. At the same time, Lordstown’s pickup doesn’t look like a geometry question coming to life via a Frankenstein experiment.Like the Nikola Badger, the Lordstown Endurance features a futuristic yet familiar profile. Likely, this will have mass appeal relative to the Cybertruck. And the Endurance is priced lower than premium electric trucks.Technically, the most groundbreaking element of the Lordstown Endurance is its in-wheel motor system. Rather than housing the electric motor into the chassis, it is instead incorporated into all four wheels of the pickup truck.This setup features multiple advantages, including superior traction in low-friction surfaces (muddy or slippery conditions). Obviously, that’s a crucial component for a commercially used pickup truck.Most importantly, the in-wheel configuration has fewer moving parts than traditional vehicles. Therefore, drivers and operators don’t have to deal with the recurring, almost incessant maintenance typical of combustion-engine trucks. Over time, the cost-savings, especially for fleet operators, will be incredibly significant.Plus, the Endurance only takes 30 minutes to recharge on a fast charger, according to Lordstown’s website. Time is money and even here, the Endurance delivers for its customers.If you’re thinking that the Endurance’s in-wheel motor is a radical departure from how vehicles (whether electric or otherwise) are made, you’re right. By removing the motor component to the wheels, the Endurance has more usable space. Again, that’s a net positive for commercial buyers.However, by moving the motor to the wheels, the Endurance has an unsprung weight dilemma. In a practical view, unsprung components absorb the forces of the road independently to the rest of the vehicle. Thus, this creates potential reliability issues. Not only that, the wheels represent rotational mass, meaning they also absorb torqueTo be fair, Lordstown claims that it undergoes extensive testing simulating all kinds of real-world conditions. Plus, it will be bad marketing to introduce a pickup called the Endurance that couldn’t, you know, endure.To get around the reliability concerns without spiking up the cost of the pickup, Endurance has given up some performance. Based on Lordstown’s estimate, its truck will hit 60 miles per hour from standstill in 5.5 seconds. That’s slower than molasses, especially today and especially for an EV.The Nikola Badger launches to the same speed in a blistering 2.9 seconds. I don’t think the Endurance’s core customers will care about acceleration too much. But because the Badger is so thrilling, it will appeal to commercial buyers and personal drivers.And believe me, that 2.6 seconds shaving makes a huge difference.As any smart car buyer will tell you, you never buy a new car on its debut year. Admittedly, this probably applies more to combustion-engine cars than EVs, but the principle remains the same. Basically, you want to let the first-year buyers be the guinea pigs. When reported problems are disseminated in automotive publications, you can make more informed decisions as a buyer.Frankly, I’m still hung up on Lordstown’s in-wheel motors. Yes, I recognize that it’s a brilliant technology. But let’s face it – very few companies have experimented with this technology. Lordstown will be one of the few that has implemented it into a production vehicle.It’s just a common-sense concern here: if the technology was so great, why isn’t everyone rushing to do it? Likely, customers will wait out for a year or two before diving into the Endurance.While DiamondPeak stock is a risky idea, the narrative has strong fundamental support. With a credible manufacturing plan, Lordstown is already a step ahead of the game.Additionally, the company’s Endurance is priced right for the commercial customer, with fast-charging capabilities and superior traction in rough conditions. Therefore, EV investors may want to take a close look at this opportunity.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in NKLA.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

      "Haber:  The stock market's huge gains over the summer put many investors in a euphoric mood coming into September, but this month has thus far been brutal. Two days of selling last week showed few signs of letting up after the holiday weekend, and high-flying tech stocks continued to bear the brunt of the damage. As of just after 11 a.m. EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) was down 405 points to 27,729. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) dropped 58 points to 3,369, while the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) was off 249 points to 11,063.The electric-vehicle space has been a battleground for growth-seeking investors, as industry leader Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has seen a number of new upstarts come into the space looking to stake their claims. Nikola (NASDAQ: NKLA) came public by merging into a special purpose acquisition company, but today, it got a huge boost of confidence through a high-profile partnership with one of the biggest automakers in the world.Shares of Nikola soared almost 40% Tuesday morning. Investors were excited about the huge news involving the electric vehicle maker and auto giant General Motors (NYSE: GM).The two companies announced their strategic partnership Tuesday morning. Under the terms of the deal, General Motors will make \"in-kind contributions\" to the venture, and in exchange will receive an 11% equity stake in Nikola worth roughly $2 billion. GM will also have the right to appoint a member to Nikola's board of directors. GM and Nikola anticipate a quick completion, expecting to close on the deal by the end of September.Image source: Nikola.The specifics of the deal have huge implications for Nikola. The upstart recently started taking preorders for its Badger pickup truck, but ramping up actual production had been a bit of a question mark for Nikola. As part of the deal, GM will provide engineering and development work that will help get the Badger ready for full production. In addition, Nikola will be able to draw from GM's wide array of parts and components.General Motors also gets some useful benefits from the venture. Nikola will use the GM Ultium battery system as well as fuel cell technology under the Hydrotec brand. Although the partnership will begin with the Badger, Nikola and GM will work together on the electric vehicle specialist's commercial truck programs as well.Nikola founder and CEO Trevor Milton highlighted the advantages of working with GM, citing \"decades of supplier and manufacturing knowledge, validated and tested production-ready EV propulsion, world-class engineering, and investor confidence.\" Milton's also happy that GM now has a vested interest in seeing Nikola win in its battle against Tesla and other EV manufacturers.GM CEO Mary Barra put the deal in a larger context. She noted that GM is trying to build scale in order to cut its battery and fuel cell costs, essentially acknowledging that its strategy will be to undercut Tesla on price. Moreover, extending fuel-cell technology to the commercial truck segment will be an important milestone for General Motors.GM stock rose 7%, while Tesla was down 15%. However, investors shouldn't think that the Elon Musk-led company is quaking in its boots. Much of the stock's drop Tuesday was likely due to S&P Dow Indices choosing not to include Tesla in the S&P 500.Nevertheless, the Nikola-GM partnership at least makes a contest out of the race toward making the transition from fossil fuel-powered vehicles to electric vehicles. Tesla still has a huge lead, but having Nikola in its stable will give GM a nimbler approach than the Big Three auto stock had on its own.10 stocks we like better than General MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "Haber:  By Ben KlaymanDETROIT, Sept 8 (Reuters) - From the moment he was named chief operating officer and heir apparent to the top spot at Ford Motor Co F.N in February, Jim Farley has touted the growth potential of its commercial vehicles.But it's not just more trucks and vans that Farley wants to sell. As Farley prepares to takes over as chief executive on Oct. 1, he is betting Ford can transform its commercial vehicle business to generate recurring revenue through sales of services that take advantage of the software, data and connectivity in its F-Series pickup truck and Transit vans.\"Think of it as a second F-150,\" Farley told Reuters, referring to the U.S. automaker's lucrative full-size truck business that generates $50 billion in annual revenue. \"We have the F-150 everyone loves. There's this other business out here that's huge.\"\"Think of the data being more powerful than the fuel economy of the vehicle,\" he added.Automakers like Ford have talked for a long time about generating post-sale revenue from connected vehicles, but they have struggled to deliver. As a result, Ford has been abandoned by growth-oriented investors, despite its lucrative F-series franchise.Ford now is trying to show it can grow, and build a competitive moat around its commercial vehicle business before electric car leader Tesla Inc TSLA.O, other startups and larger technology players like Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O enter those markets.The U.S. market alone last year accounted for more than $58 billion in sales of commercial trucks and vans, everything from Class-1 regular pickups to Class-7 heavy-duty trucks like the Ford F-750, according to ACT Research.Farley is counting on a new hire to help build data-generated revenue from Ford's commercial vehicle business: Alex Purdy, former head of agricultural equipment maker Deere & Co's DE.N Silicon Valley office.At Deere, Purdy led efforts to deliver artificial intelligence (AI) on the farm through smart equipment and founded John Deere Labs to help build a \"sticky\" relationship with customers. Deere's aftermarket parts and services business accounted for about 15% to 20% of $35 billion in sales last year. In his first interview since his May hiring to lead Ford's commercial vehicle connectivity business, Purdy said he \"helped transition an industrial goods business that thought about metal bending into a service business.\"Among the products developed by Deere while Purdy worked there were the ExactEmerge planter that offers improved seed spacing at higher speeds, freeing up workers for other jobs; and the See and Spray distribution system that will use smart cameras to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy crops, allowing for reduced use of herbicides when it's introduced next year.Purdy, a 35-year-old former investment banker and consultant, grew up on a farm in Okotoks, outside Calgary, Canada, and describes himself as \"passionate about smart connected vehicles, automotive, AI.\"Ford is the leading commercial vehicle brand in the United States and Europe - with shares of 40% and almost 15%, respectively - thanks to the F-Series trucks as well as its Transit vans.\"Ford is the 900-pound gorilla in the commercial business,\" said Rhett Ricart, a big Ford commercial vehicle dealer in Columbus, Ohio. \"They've always had this competitive advantage.\"Earlier this year, Ricart moved into a new 116,000-square-foot commercial truck facility that dwarfs the old 18,000-square-foot building, and said he looks forward to working with Ford as they roll out additional connected services.Purdy and other Ford officials want Ford's commercial customers to regularly pay for services, creating a revenue stream that flows throughout the vehicle's life, beyond a one-time transaction every few years.Ford officials talk about products as such geolocation services to optimize route planning and reduce gasoline usage, predictive products that allow for faster oil changes and fleet management operations.\"When you measure time as a commodity like money, there are lots of those kinds of experiences that customers are willing to pay for because they're in the productivity business,\" Farley said.The goal for Ford is to lower the total cost of ownership for its commercial customers; raise productivity, such as increased package delivery; and reduce downtime for customer vehicles, said Ted Cannis, head of Ford's North American commercial vehicle business.\"So now the total addressable market, instead of being just new-vehicle sales is the entire process - parts, service, accessories, connected services,\" he said.Hans Schep, head of Ford's European commercial vehicle business, said the shift in focus is playing out in meetings on quality. Five years ago, those meetings were about how to reduce Ford's warranty costs, he said. Now, the discussions are about how to keep its customers' vehicles on the road.Ford's push in commercial vehicles will work hand-in-hand with the push to electrify its vehicles, including the F-150 and Transit.As part of the efforts, Ford and Germany's Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE said in June they would make up to 8 million units of mid-sized pickup trucks and commercial vans over the lifecycle of the vehicles, starting in 2022. Farley believes the automakers' alliance will allow Ford to use their combined scale to build its European commercial vehicle business even more.

      "Haber:  Electric vehicles are now among the hottest segments of the stock market. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) leads the way, but NIO Inc (NYSE: NIO), Nikola Corporation (NASDAQ: NKLA), Blink Charging (NASDAQ: BLNK), and Workhorse (NASDAQ: WKHS) are all contenders for the market's attention right now. Plus, there are a number of high-profile private companies that could go public soon and nearly every major automaker has made a push into EVs. By most accounts, these stocks look expensive. Price to sales ratios look more like those of tech stocks than manufacturing companies -- but there's also reason to think these growth stocks are worth paying for if you're willing to wait for the EV industry to mature. Image source: NIO.There are some things that will likely be tailwinds for the EV industry over the next decade. These should help all EV stocks, albeit in different ways. According to the International Energy Agency, 4.79 million electric vehicles were sold in 2019, up from 3.27 million in 2018, and just 0.72 million in 2015. This includes both full electric and hybrid electric vehicles, but shows just how fast the industry is growing.What's incredible is how much room EVs still have to run. Just 2.6% of global car sales were EVs last year, and just 1% of all cars on the road are electric. Given the potential and growth rate, electric vehicles have a lot of opportunities ahead. This should be a rising tide that lifts the whole industry. Right now, the upfront cost to buy an electric vehicle is higher than that of buying an internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle. But that doesn't mean EVs can't be cheaper long-term. We'll look at fuel costs below, but before that, one thing to consider is how much less maintenance EVs require. AAA estimated that EVs will reduce maintenance costs by about 17%, while other estimates exceed 25%. With fewer moving parts, what's clear is that EVs will be less costly to maintain than ICE vehicles long-term. Now, let's talk about why people want to own electric vehicles. Let's be honest: Reducing emissions and saving the world is a sales pitch for some, but isn't going to keep EVs growing forever. What will is that EVs are cooler and quicker vehicles than ICE counterparts. The Tesla Model 3 is a great example. It has a 3.2 second 0-60 time, which is much faster than the BMW M4's time of 4.1 seconds, despite the M4 costing nearly twice as much as a Model 3. EVs have a natural advantage because electric motors have more torque than ICE rivals, which gives them a huge advantage in a drag race with almost any EV model. That makes for a fun drive, and should help with sales of EVs for skeptical buyers.Just a few years ago, it wasn't uncommon to see a new electric vehicle announced with less than 100 miles of range. That's technically enough to complete the daily commute for most Americans, but hardly makes an EV a practical vehicle.Today, most EVs have a range of over 200 miles, and Tesla is leading the pack with multiple offerings of over 300 miles of range. At the same time, EV chargers are becoming faster and more common, easing range anxiety even further. According to the Department of Energy, there are currently 26,586 charging stations in the U.S. with 85,353 charging outlets, compared to about 111,100 gasoline stations. But the number of EV stations has about doubled in the past three years as companies like Blink Charging (NASDAQ: BLNK) have increased their networks. The difference between gasoline and electricity is that there's access to electricity on almost every block. Any home could have a charger, thousands of businesses are adding them, and commercial networks are getting bigger as well. There may be more gasoline charging stations today, but finding a charger is getting easier by the day, and that's helping reduce the range anxiety of owning an EV. Today's national average cost of gasoline is $2.23 per gallon, and at that price a vehicle that gets 25 miles per gallon will cost $0.09 per mile for fuel. At the average rate of 13.2 cents per kWh, an EV with a 75 kWh battery and 322 miles of range will cost $0.03 per mile for fuel. Not only is electricity about one-third the cost per mile, if you have solar on your roof or buy solar or wind energy from your utility you can have 100% clean energy, with cost savings as the kicker. The single biggest cost that goes into an electric vehicle is the battery. So the rapid increase in battery capacity globally and the reduction in prices should be helpful to EVs' competitiveness.Bloomberg New Energy Finance reports that the cost of batteries has fallen from $1,100 per kW-hr in 2010 to $156 in 2019. And they expect costs to fall below $100 per kW-hr by 2023. For a 100 kW-hr battery, the savings between 2019 and 2023 would add up to $5,600, and make EVs even more competitive long-term. Despite being just 1% of all vehicles on the road, EV stocks are more valuable than those of all traditional automakers put together. In fact, Tesla alone is more valuable than Toyota, GM, and Ford put together. TSLA Market Cap data by YChartsThe valuations electric vehicle companies have received may end up being justified, but right now they look very expensive, and may come down to earth if they don't hit lofty expectations. There are a lot of electric vehicle companies to choose from today, but they're all high fliers by any measure. One company investors should keep their eye on is Blink Charging. The company is building the charging infrastructure needed to fuel electric vehicles, and that could be a lucrative space long-term. NIO is also a company I'm keeping an eye on. It's a Chinese EV manufacturer, which gives it a large and eager market, and is growing like a weed. It delivered just 3,533 vehicles in July, but that was up 322.1% versus a year ago, and so far in 2020 deliveries are up 111.3% to 17,702 vehicles. If that growth rate keeps up it could be the market leader in just a few years. Tesla, Nikola, and Workhorse are the three other stocks I've mentioned here, but a combination of sky-high valuations and low sales (in the cases of Nikola and Workhorse) should make investors worry about these stocks. Eventually, these companies all have to start making money and that's when investors may be disappointed at how much money there is to be made in the electric vehicle market.

      "Haber:  By Medha SinghSept 8 (Reuters) - Nasdaq futures tumbled on Tuesday as traders returning from a long weekend sold off shares of Tesla and other tech heavyweights, while simmering U.S.-China tensions and concerns over a rocky economic rebound also weighed on sentiment.Wall Street's tech-fueled rally halted last week with the Nasdaq .IXIC closing 6% below its record closing high. Investors booked profits, taking advantage of a rally that lifted the index about 70% from its pandemic-low in March.The Nasdaq closed Friday with its biggest weekly decline since the height of the pandemic-linked sell-off in March, with shares of Facebook Inc FB.O, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, Apple Inc AAPL.O, Netflix Inc NFLX.O and Google-parent Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O sliding between 1.4% and 3.7%.The group - commonly known as \"FAANG\" stocks - have been largely responsible for the rebound on Wall Street even as data points to a faltering recovery for the domestic economy. The companies were down between 3.1% and 4.1% in premarket trading.Tesla Inc TSLA.O plunged 12.6% trading after the electric-car maker was excluded from a group of companies being added to the S&P 500. Meanwhile, media reports said SoftBank 9984.T made significant option purchases during the run-up in U.S. stocks, reminding investors that market makers might have billions of dollars worth of long positions as hedges against options trades, which will have to be sold as prices fall. \"If you bought a lot of call options in the second quarter, you're doing very well, but that creates a problem for later when you need to unwind these positions,\" said Ken Peng, Citi Private Bank's head of Asia Investment Strategy.Peng added that the six largest U.S. technology stocks now comprise 15% of the global market capitalization, all but squeezing shorts out completely.\"So there's positioning hurdles to rise further, and the loss could be unpredictable\", he said.At 7:36 a.m. ET, Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1were down 300 points, or 2.6%, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1were down 101 points, or 0.36%, and S&P 500 e-minis EScv1were down 32.75 points, or 0.96%.Fears over potential U.S. sanctions against China's biggest chipmaker SMIC 0981.HK hit domestic suppliers, with Applied Materials AMAT.O, Lam Research LRCX.O and KLA Corp KLAC.O dropping between 3.8% and 4.9%.U.S. President Donald Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden are set to visit battleground states this week as some opinion polls show the race tightening with less than 60 days to go until the Nov. 3 election.

      "Haber:  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe comeuppance for the Nasdaq Composite is finally here, and Workhorse (NASDAQ:WKHS) is getting caught up in the ruckus. From peak to trough, WKHS stock fell 16% before snapping back big time on Friday, closing the session up 11.5%.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n",
      " The ultimate question following the quick drop and pop is whether Workhorse’s uptrend is still intact or not.Was the severity of the whack sufficient enough to reverse the nascent uptrend in WKHS stock? Did it destroy the bulls’ well-founded narrative based on the beauty and stability of the price trend?No, and no.As we will discuss in greater detail below, this week’s selling raid was nothing more than a garden-variety retracement for WKHS. It remains a good buying opportunity, even after Friday’s amazing recovery.Workhorse is a technology company offering solutions to commercial transportation. It designs and manufactures high-performance electric vehicles, placing it in the same industry as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA). This should explain part of why WKHS stock has been on fire this year. Traders have been bidding up electric vehicle stocks with abandon.Virtually all of Workhorse’s gains came in June. Its share price ballooned nearly ten-fold before a top was found. After that, the market gods hit the pause button, allowing the stock to digest its gargantuan gains and its long-term moving averages to catch up. Impressively, WKHS held on to the lion’s share of the gains. That type of behavior confirms the bid beneath the surface remains, and June’s meteoric rise was not just built on hype alone.\n",

      " August carved out a nice little series of higher pivot highs and lows, showing buying aggression was finally building. Just before this week’s dip, prices ramped to a two-month high. That, more than anything, is what allowed WKHS to pull back substantially but remain in a healthy uptrend.Even with Wednesday and Thursday’s two-day whack, prices are still above the 20-day moving average. The big tell for me that demands remaining bullish are the volume patterns. Look at the participation during the last three advances versus the subsequent pullbacks. Signs of accumulation emerged during each upswing. In contrast, volume during the retracements was minimal. Though we saw widespread distribution in the Nasdaq and mega-cap tech stocks, the massive selling did not inflict WKHS stock.That, coupled with the fact that we are still above all moving averages, leads me to believe this dip is an attractive buying opportunity — particularly if you missed the breakout earlier in the week.When sizing up the best options trade for this type of setup, I consider both the stock price and implied volatility. Right now, WKHS stock is cheap enough for long call or short put plays.However, the sky-high implied volatility of 175% makes me think twice about buying calls. They are too expensive. Thus, if we want a lower-probability, higher-potential profitability trade, call spreads are a must.On the flip side, the rich options prices work to the advantage of a naked put by increasing the premium received. The margin requirement will be minimal, given the low cost of shares, resulting in a smile-inducing return on investment. I also prefer the naked put in this case because the Nasdaq’s sharp pullback could continue to hang over tech stocks, preventing them from any kind of explosive move higher.In that scenario, the naked put is likely the better play.The Trade: Sell the Oct $12.50 put for $1.25.Consider it a bet that WKHS stock sits above $12.50 at expiration. The max gain is $125 per contract.On the date of publication, Tyler Craig did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.For a free trial to the best trading community on the planet and Tyler’s current home, click here!The post How to Profit From Red-Hot Workhorse Stock Right Now appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\n",

      "Haber:  By Swati PandeySYDNEY, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Asian shares were on the defensive on Monday as investors grappled with sky-high valuations against the backdrop of a global economy in the grip of a deep coronavirus-induced recession while oil prices dropped sharply.Chinese stocks started lower while shares of Hong Kong-listed Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp 0981.HK (SMIC) plunged to the lowest since June 16 on fears the firm could be added to a U.S. trade blacklist. China's blue-chip index .CSI300 slipped 0.5% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng .HSI eased 0.2%.Japan's Nikkei .N225 fell 0.4% with SoftBank 9984.T coming under heavy selling following media reports it has spent at least $4 billion buying call options on listed U.S. technology stocks. Australian shares .AXJO, which had opened in the red, reversed losses to edge up 0.1% led by miners, while South Korea .KS11 added 0.4%.That left MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS barely changed after two straight days of losses toppled it from a 2-1/2-year peak last week.World shares .MIWD00000PUS hit a record high last week as central bank stimulus drove asset valuations to heady levels. The rally has since cooled as tech stocks sold off while worries over patchy economic recovery dogged investors.The immediate focus on the day will be on China's exports and imports data for August, due later in the morning.China's exports are expected to have posted a second month of solid gains in August as more of its trading partners relaxed coronavirus lockdowns and reopened their economies, a Reuters poll showed. U.S. stock futures opened in the red, with E-minis for the S&P 500 ESc1 down 0.3% and Nasdaq futures NQc1 sliding 1.1%.

      "Haber:  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLabor Day will keep U.S. equity markets closed on Monday, making Tuesday Sept. 8 the first trading day of next week. With that in mind, let’s look at a few top stock trades ahead of a long three-day weekend. Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com\n",
      "The volatility over the last few days has been palpable and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is target No. 1 for many traders.After a couple of tough days shares are finding buyers — a pullback of which doesn’t look bad at all amid the current run, even though shares fell more than 25% from the peak to the recent low.The 261.8% extension and 20-day moving average are acting as support, while the 10-day moving average is acting as resistance. We need to see which one of these levels gives way and if we can see a continuation in the direction of that break.On a break of the 20-day moving average and 261.8% extension, let’s see if Tesla takes out Friday’s low at $372.02 and closes below it. If so, it puts the 50-day moving average and breakout level near $330 on the table.Above the 10-day moving average and three-times range extension, could put $500 back on the table.Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com\n",
      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average has not kept pace with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, although it’s trying to hold up. A look at the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSEARCA:DIA) shows the ETF butting up right into its highs from February. While also enduring a quick selloff, it’s finding support at the 20-day moving average. Keep it simple from here. On a daily-up rotation above Friday’s high puts a run back toward $290 and the current high in play. Below the 20-day moving average and Friday’s low (at $277.01) puts the 50-day moving average on the table. Below that and — yep, you guessed it — the 200-day moving average is up next. Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com\n",
      "Interestingly, the banks have been showing some strength as of late, even in the face of the recent decline. Among investors’ favorite is Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), which ended Friday up more than 3%.In any regard, the stock is reclaiming the 200-week moving average on the move, after finding the $25.50 level to be support. This key level is a notable development and leaves BAC open for a test of the 50-week moving average.This mark has been resistance both times it has been tested since the novel coronavirus selloff. A move over it puts the June highs in play near $28.80. Above that and $30 is on the table.On a decline back below $25 creates a problem, as it puts BAC below several key levels and uptrend support (blue line). Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com\n",
      "JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) has a similar setup to BAC, clearing that key $102 area and trying to press higher. Also like BofA, the 50-week moving average has been resistance so far since the selloff. On a rotation through last month’s high (at $106.43) and the 50-week moving average will again be the target. It also puts the $112 level and the June highs in play at $114.65.A break of $100 will put the 10-week and 20-week moving averages on the table. Below them and traders will likely wait for a better setup. Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com\n",
      "Smith & Wesson (NASDAQ:SWBI) shares are struggling on Friday after reporting earnings on Thursday evening.The stock is now working on its third straight decline and at Friday’s low, was down almost 24% from its 2020 high made on Wednesday. Now what? If the stock closes below the 50-day moving average, it puts a decline down to the $15.50 to $16 area. There it finds the 61.8% retracement of the 2020 range and recent uptrend support (blue line). On the upside, I want to see SWBI reclaim the 50-day and 20-day moving averages. Above puts $20 back in play, followed by resistance near $21.50 and then the 2020 high at $22.40. On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.The post 5 Top Stock Trades for Tuesday: TSLA, DIA, BAC, JPM, SWBI appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\n",

      "Haber:  The strong and sustained rally in tech stocks, which appears to have finally come to an end, was due in no small part to a single investor. According to the Financial Times, citing \"people familiar with the matter,\" Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank (OTC: SFTBY) was the responsible party.The article's sources say that SoftBank has taken up huge positions in share options in top tech stocks over the past month, to the point where some contracts for individual titles set new records. In recent weeks this activity has also dramatically pushed up volume for single-company calls (i.e., the right to buy a stock at a certain price).Image source: Getty Images.Higher demand for options usually drives the share prices of the underlying stocks higher, and this has been the case for some of the more famous companies in the sector. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has been a particularly strong performer, with a 831% rise in the last month alone. Other tech stars have also risen steeply: Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is up by 84%, for example, while Netflix (NASDAQ: AMZN) advanced 78%.Although the article's sources did not identify the particular stocks for which SoftBank was/is buying calls, these well-capitalized companies were likely targets. The company revealed in an Aug. 17 regulatory filing that it has bought common stock generously in all three recently.Despite the recent sharp pullback in these shares, the article's sources say that SoftBank plans to continue buying derivatives contracts in them. If this is the case, it seems likely another rally is in store for the tech sector. Perhaps that has already begun for some of the affected companies. In late-afternoon trading on Friday, Tesla was up by 3.6%, although Amazon and Netflix were both down by around 2%. 10 stocks we like better than SOFTBANK CP UNSP ADRWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "Haber:  BERLIN, Sept 4 (Reuters) - German biotechnology firm Curevac CVAC.O expects to be able to produce the COVID-19 vaccine it is developing at scale by the end of the year, investor Dietmar Hopp told the Handelsblatt business daily on Friday.\"We want to make 100 million doses available by the end of the year,\" said billionaire Hopp, one of the founders of software company SAP SAPG.DE.He said he expected regulatory approval in spring or summer of 2021, although limited clearance could come this year to vaccinate people doing jobs that put them at risk of catching COVID-19 or regions with high rates of infection.Curevac is likely to be beaten to market by U.S. rival Moderna MRNA.O and Germany's Biontech 22UAy.F.\"We can't win this race,\" Hopp said. \"But we want to win the race to produce the best vaccine and here we have good chances.\"The Tuebingen-based startup, valued at $10 billion after floating last month on Nasdaq, is one of a number of firms developing vaccines based on molecules carrying a genetic code called messenger RNA (mRNA) to treat diseases.Hopp said Curevac may also expand its cooperation with Grohmann, a subsidiary of Elon Musk's electric car maker Tesla TSLA.O, in developing so-called RNA printers that would make it possible to decentralise vaccine production.Musk was in Germany this week and visited Curevac, sparking speculation that he may invest in the company. Hopp earlier dismissed this as \"pure fantasy\".

      "Haber:  By Tom WestbrookSINGAPORE, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Asia's stock markets had their worst session in two weeks on Friday following a tech-led plunge on Wall Street, though gains in safer assets like bonds and dollars were muted as investors awaited U.S. job data to see if it triggers a bigger selloff.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS fell 1.5% and looked set to snap a six-week winning streak with a 2.3% weekly loss, its biggest since April.The Nikkei .N225 declined 1%. Australia's ASX 200 .AXJO led losses with a 3% fall as global investors sold growth-exposed miners like BHP BHP.AX and traders trimmed positions ahead of the weekend in case Wall Street takes another dive.Elsewhere drops were a little lighter, with a 1.5% decline for the Hang Seng .HSI and a 1.3% fall in Korea - much less than the overnight 5% plunge in the tech-heavy Nasdaq .IXIC.\"It's not panic selling,\" said Jun Bei Liu, a portfolio manager at Sydney's Tribeca Investment Partners which runs about A$2 billion ($1.4 billion) in domestic and international funds.\"The pullback is probably a healthy pullback, given the amount of outperformance tech companies have had.\"Futures were under pressure but backed off early lows. Nasdaq 100 futures NQc1 were last down 1.1%, S&P 500 futures ESc1 down 0.3% and those for the pan-Europe Euro STOXX 50 STXEc1 were up 0.3%. FTSE FFIc1 futures fell 0.5%.Focus is now on U.S. payrolls figures due at 1230 GMT, which could be a selling trigger if an expected slowdown in hiring is deeper than forecast. Foreign exchange markets were on edge at the possibility and a safety bid helped the dollar cling to gains that have it headed for its best week in more than two months.

US/Thursday's tumble was the biggest one-day percentage drop on the tech-focused Nasdaq 100 .NDX since March and the darling stocks of recent months were hit hardest. .NApple AAPL.O fell 8%, Tesla TSLA.O 9% and Microsoft MSFT.O 6%. Still, the plunge only wound the Nasdaq .IXIC  back as far as where it sat last Tuesday.

In South Korea Samsung 005930.KS fell 1.3% and there was modest pressure on Apple suppliers in Shanghai and Taipei.

      "Haber:  MUMBAI (Reuters Breakingviews) - Mohammed bin Salman has spent the five years since his elderly father became king of Saudi Arabia surprising in ways good, bad, and downright ugly. From the rumble in the Ritz to unleashing a sovereign fund to the silencing of dissidents, the story of his rise through one of the largest royal families to a position of unprecedented power is astonishing.As crown prince, the 35-year-old is set to be the first monarch from the third generation of Al Saud. But the Twitter-obsessed millennial stands apart from the family’s ranks of overseas-educated, heavily Westernised princes – “MbS”, as he is universally known, stayed in the kingdom to study. In \"Blood and Oil\", Bradley Hope and Justin Scheck have gone to painstaking lengths to lift the veil on the character of a young man shaking up the country, and beyond. The result is a gripping page-turner. Hope and Scheck portray a wily palace operator with a dazzling memory and work ethic rare in the royal court, an individual who honed his cut-throat instincts well before he started wielding his power on the global stage. MbS helped his now 84-year-old father beat an addiction to painkillers and leverage relationships to outmanoeuvre would-be usurpers when King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz died in January 2015. By doing so, he forged his own – far from given - path to power.The kingdom was due a shakeup. Former kings, referred to in the book as “desiccated old men”, derived power from consensus, adopting change at a glacial pace out of lethargy but also fear of ultra-conservative religious clerics. With his father on the throne MbS took swift action, aiming to win the support of a population mostly under 30. Many Saudis still live near the poverty line or struggle to find work they want to do. Some of MbS’ reforms have been crowd-pleasers, others aimed at taking out the political opposition. Women are now allowed to drive, and royals with unimaginable riches have been stripped of wealth the new powers said were acquired through corruption. Many were temporarily locked up in the “Sheikhdown” in the Ritz-Carlton, dubbed the world’s most luxurious prison. Among Hope and Scheck’s most interesting insights is MbS’ intense and petty jealously of individuals who commanded more global presence or respect than he did. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal was for decades Saudi Arabia’s best-known businessman and, at one time, a top Citigroup investor. The crown prince’s admiration didn’t stop him being locked up in the Ritz too.Some of MbS’ most aggressive financial moves, it turns out, were ideas first pitched by Alwaleed: Hope and Scheck describe the younger prince backing his elder cousin’s 2012 proposal to turn the country’s Public Investment Fund into a global investor like the sovereign funds in Abu Dhabi and Qatar. Even the plan to sell off parts of Saudi Aramco, they note, wasn’t entirely new. Other pillars of MbS’ ambitious Vision 2030 plan, to wean the kingdom off oil, had been pitched by the World Bank and others for years. Crazier plans are still in motion. Neom, a futuristic urban development on the Red Sea in an area with a near-total absence of fresh water, had some distant financial logic. Hope and Scheck say the project was intended to reduce billions of dollars of outflows by providing all the services, from health to entertainment, that Saudi princes seek abroad. MbS’ ambitions look less wild in the context of Saudi Arabia’s desert Gulf neighbours. The emirate of Dubai, after all, went as far as to construct an indoor ski slope and artificial islands in the shape of a world map. What’s more, Hope and Scheck emphasise how much MbS has been enabled and encouraged by praise from global consultants like McKinsey to executives like SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son to international bankers - all ready to make a quick buck. The book also serves as a reminder that the Saudi status quo was hardly perfect. MbS’ relatives and rivals were spoiled. In one vivid example of many, Prince Turki bin Abdullah is described as having kept a modern-day harem – a group of women who live lavishly all over the world, ready to pick him up anywhere. Given all this, it’s tempting to see MbS’ ruthlessness as a broom to the kingdom’s problems, even as admirable. Hope and Scheck show, however, how the prince’s inability to tolerate dissent and black-and-white view of the world may lie at the root of his multiple misadventures. The list is long: a war in Yemen, the role of his close confidantes in the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the blockade of Qatar, and the effective kidnapping of Saad Hariri, who was Lebanon’s prime minister at the time. Corporate executives will find useful lessons here too. It was King Abdullah’s failure to properly implement an allegiance council that ultimately made it easier for King Salman bin Abdulaziz to cast others adrift, Hope and Scheck note. MbS was easily elevated into a position where he could radically change the course of the nation. So far, MbS has succeeded in spending billions of dollars of official money abroad on everything from stakes in Uber and Tesla to SoftBank’s Vision Fund, but his annual Future Investment Initiative confab hasn’t secured the inward investment needed to underwrite his economic transformation plans. One positive for him is that it’s unclear how much of a difference the Khashoggi affair has really made. Investors were quick to mingle again with the prince, albeit somewhat more in private, but still with the hope of extracting funds.In \"Blood and Oil\", MbS’ adventures in power seem like those of an entire lifetime of any ordinary politician or leader. Kingly but not yet king, it is probably just the beginning of a highly disruptive legacy.

      "Haber:  By Tom Westbrook and Alwyn ScottSINGAPORE/NEW YORK, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Asia's stock markets slipped on Friday, following the steepest Wall Street selloff since June, while safer bonds and the dollar found support as investors sought shelter.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS fell 0.6%. Japan's Nikkei .N225 dropped 1.3% while markets in Sydney .AXJO and Seoul .KS11 fell 2%.The moves are more muted than the 5% plunge on the tech-heavy Nasdaq .IXIC overnight, or the S&P 500's 3.5% drop, which traders said was overdue given recent frothy gains.But investors are worried the fall might turn into a deeper rout, with a crucial U.S. payrolls report due later on Friday seen as possible selling trigger if it disappoints.After-hours trade in U.S. tech companies pointed to further pressure and futures dropped, with S&P 500 futures ESc1 down 0.4% early in Asia and Nasdaq 100 futures NQc1 down 1.2%.\"No single factor sparked the sell-off, rather it seemed to be an accumulation of worries about the rally in the tech sector, overcrowding and rising valuations,\" said Kerry Craig, Global Market Strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.\"However, his is unlikely to be a repeat of the tech wreck of the late 1990s, given how much the market and sector have changed,\" he added.The tumble was the biggest one-day percentage drop on the tech-focused Nasdaq 100 .NDX since March, while the broader Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones indexes fell by their most since June and the darling stocks of recent months were hit hardest. .NApple AAPL.O fell 8%, Tesla TSLA.O 9% and Microsoft MSFT.O 6%.Still, the plunge only wound the Nasdaq's level back as far as where it sat last Tuesday. It is still up 28% for the year so far and 73% higher than its March trough.\"Now the question is whether the correction has legs or whether investors are tempted back in,\" said Rodrigo Catril of National Australia Bank in Sydney.More muted selling in Asia also focused on tech names with the sector leading losers on the Nikkei and chip makers falling in Korea. SK Hynix 000660.KS dropped 2% and Samsung 005930.KS 1.7%.The mood drove only modest moves in the currency market, with the dollar extending its recent bounce a little to put it on track for its best week since June.

      "Haber:  The week began for Tesla (TSLA) as most weeks have in 2020, by adding more muscle to the share price. The newly 5-1 split stock caught investors’ imagination who pounced on the “cheaper” shares and kept up the monumental rally in the week’s first session. Since Monday, however, the high flying stock has spent a rare couple of days in the red, nearing an 18% correction.With a new triple digit share price sitting alongside the TSLA ticker, RBC analyst Joseph Spak shared his thoughts on what is undoubtedly one of the stock market’s most controversial names.The analyst believes there are several angles from which to observe the Tesla phenomenon.There’s Tesla “the company,” disrupting the auto industry by “pushing vehicles towards electrification,” having established a “compelling and desired brand.” Here there’s no avoiding the Musk Effect. The Tesla story is incomplete without its leader’s influence on consumers’ behavior, of which Spak notes the “perception of Tesla being a superior vehicle could lead to share gains and higher margins.”Next there is Tesla “the stock” to consider. As Tesla has worked itself up to the position of 9th largest company by market cap, it has become one of the most important stocks in US markets. Spak argues analysts might have “underestimated a critical valuation point: seemingly insatiable investor demand for alternative/clean vehicles.” The result of which, Spak said, “the market has been willing to show more patience and look further out for companies such as Tesla.”Which brings us to Spak’s final point: “the valuation.” Considering Tesla’s incredible run up – up by 386% year-to-date - Spak views Tesla “as fundamentally overvalued and having to grow into its valuation.”Despite admitting that “narrative, momentum, and other factors can impact stock price,” the analyst concludes that “ultimately a company’s value is related to the PV of future FCF.”But what does it all mean for investors? As is so often the case with Tesla these days, it means a target price raise. The figure moves from $170 to $290. Still, there remains 29% of downside from current levels. There is no change to Spak’s rating, however, which stays an Underperform (i.e. Sell). (To watch Spak’s track record, click here)Overall, Tesla continues to baffle Wall Street. Among Spak’s colleagues, Musk & Co. receive a Hold consensus rating based on 4 Buys, 15 Holds and 11 Sells. The average price target clocks in at $291.04 and suggests a 28.5% decline from current levels.

      "Haber:  Shares of electric-vehicle and related companies were selling off on Thursday afternoon, a day after an investment-management company that has been a prominent investor in Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) said that it had reduced its stake in the Silicon Valley electric-vehicle (EV) maker.Here's where things stood for the group as of 1:15 p.m. EDT on Thursday, relative to their closing prices on Wednesday.Tesla was down 7.6% at that hour as well. DiamondPeak Holdings (NASDAQ: DPHC), the SPAC planning to merge with Ohio electric-pickup start-up Lordstown Motors, was the outlier in the group: Its shares were down just 0.8% at 1:15 p.m. EDT today.A post-split sell-off of Tesla put other EV stocks under pressure on Thursday. Image source: The Motley Fool.The story here is simple. These stocks, and many others, were caught in a broad-based sell-off of technology stocks on Thursday. A seasoned investor might argue that we were overdue for a day like this, given the spectacular gains posted in 2020 by Tesla, NIO, and Workhorse, the three stocks in this group that were public at the beginning of the year.NIO data by YCharts.All of the stocks in the group have benefited from the huge rally that began with Tesla late last year. In fact, it's fair to say that the newly public members of the group went public in part to take advantage of auto investors' intense interest in stocks related to EVs.(Side note: Technically speaking, Graf Industrial, which will soon merge with Velodyne Lidar, isn't an electric-vehicle stock. But Velodyne's lidar sensors are used by just about every company and group working to develop self-driving technology, a market segment closely intertwined with EV development. Given that, it's not surprising that Graf's shares tend to move with this group more often than not.) NIO just completed a $1.7 billion raise and had a great sales result in August, but its shares were down on Thursday anyway. Image source: NIO.Investors who are concerned about today's sell-off should note that some of these companies' stocks were falling on Thursday even though they had reported bullish news this week. And last but not least, Tesla announced a $5 billion stock sale to pad its balance sheet — a move that makes the Tesla-bankruptcy thesis favored by short-sellers highly unlikely to happen anytime soon.Long story short: EV stocks have had a tremendous run, and a correction shouldn't come as a surprise. But auto investors should keep in mind that nothing about the fundamentals of any of these companies has changed for the worse in the last few days.

      "Haber:  Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) have taken the investing world by storm in recent weeks.These companies haven't unveiled a groundbreaking product, made a major acquisition, or entered a new market. Instead, they've merely announced that they're splitting their stocks, and on Monday, both stocks jumped after their respective splits were completed. Tesla, whose shares split 5-for-1, surged 12.6%, adding more than $50 billion to its market cap, while Apple gained 3.4% after splitting its shares four ways, tacking on more than $70 billion in market value.Monday's gains culminated a remarkable rally set off by a frenzy ahead of the stock splits. While splits don't add to the value of the stock, they increase the availability of shares by lowering the price, making them more accessible to retail investors, and indicate that management expects the share price to continue to rise. Though they are generally perceived as a bullish signal, they don't change any of the fundamentals of the company or the value of the shares. Generally, splits don't elicit much of a response from investors, but at times they can spark rallies of their own.Image source: Getty Images.A number of brokerages reported outages amid a swarm of buyers for the two splitting stocks and Tesla's ticker was trending on Twitter at one point. It was the kind of rush that follows sought-after IPOs like Facebook's in 2012.While investors can't help but be pleased with the stock's gains as Tesla is up 72% in the last month and Apple has jumped 34%, those gains, driven by little more than investor euphoria and speculation, are reminiscent of another era that was famous for inflated tech stocks.The dot-com bubble is remembered mostly for the euphoria over newly created internet stocks that led to a boom and bust, but stock splits helped drive much of the fever in the early days. Amazon, as it rose nearly 2,000% from the beginning of 1998 to the end of 1999, split its stock on three separate occasions. The stock crashed by more than 85% from 2000 to 2002, and the company has yet to do another stock split despite massive gains.Other examples of individual stocks soaring on splits abound. Sony shares jumped 7.7% on Dec. 28, 1999, following a split announcement. After General Electric, one of the most valuable companies in the U.S., bounced following a stock split, Argus Research analyst James Kelleher explained at the time, \"From a mathematical point of view, this doesn't add value, but it's a strong psychological move.\" Yahoo!, as big a dot-com darling as any, split its stock three times during the boom. Back then, Cantor Fitzgerald chief market strategist Bill Meehan said the fervor for stock splits had become a \"retail phenomenon,\" referring to retail investors, and commentator Herb Greenberg derided the trend, saying, \"This split thing is getting way out of hand.\" What today's era has in common with the dot-com boom is that these moves are also being driven by retail investors. Online brokerages like E*Trade Financial helped democratize stock trading and make it more accessible for retail investors in the late 1990s, and today Robinhood has brought in a new class of investors by offering no-fee trades, a move that other online brokerages have followed. Commission-free trading has helped encourage day trading, and the bull market that began in March has led to increases in activity from retail investing, especially as Americans have had limited options for spending their time and money.Apple and Tesla are among the most popular stocks on Robinhood, and through the first half of the year retail investors have made up 19.5% of trading activity, up from 14.9% a year ago and about 10% a decade ago.  At the end of last year, Robinhood investors held 4.4 million positions in S&P 500 stocks; now they have more than 14 million. New E*Trade accounts have also spiked during the crisis with more than 250,000 additions in March, compared to less than 50,000 in the months prior. Mom-and-pop investors clearly want in on the rally and have helped fuel the boom in Apple and Tesla.After their recent surges, it's easy to call Apple and Tesla overvalued, but it's also true that each one dominates its respective market. Apple has built a consumer tech empire on devices like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, while Tesla is the clear leader in electric cars, which many analysts expect to be a massive market, eventually displacing traditional combustion vehicles. The rise of Tesla, which has struggled to deliver consistent profitability and has been saddled at times with other problems, including liquidity, is more reminiscent of dot-com stocks. The stock is up more than 1,000% over the past year, and the surge over the last month has come on little news. At its current valuation, the company is more than twice as valuable as any other car manufacturer, including Toyota, Volkswagen, and General Motors, despite being much smaller by production. Apple, meanwhile, is a mature company whose high-growth  days are behind it. With a P/E ratio near 40, the stock is more expensive than it's been at any point since before the financial crisis. While investors have bid the stock up earlier in the year on hopes for a 5G \"supercycle\" of upgrades as well as a subscription bundle, the recent gains seem to have come predominantly from the stock split, much as they have for Tesla as well.One thing is clear. The momentum-fueled rally can't go on forever, and the higher it goes, the more likely it will be that the bubble will burst. Bidding a stock up because of a split is nothing new, but the disconnect between a split-induced surge and a fundamentally unchanged company means investors are paying more money for the same amount of value. That's a sign that the game has turned psychological and euphoria over future gains, rather than improving fundamentals, has become the primary driver of growth.The lessons of the dot-com era, which show how a stock-split-driven boom can end in disaster, have never been more relevant.  10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "Haber:  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhile the market is buzzing about the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) 5-for-1 stock split, there may be a much better bargain in the automotive sector. I’m referring to old American stand-by General Motors (NYSE:GM). It’s true that GM stock has struggled in 2020, but a turnaround could be in the offing.Source: Shutterstock\n",
      " Granted, General Motors isn’t as flashy or as newsworthy as Tesla and other hot carmakers. On the other hand, contrarians should appreciate GM stock’s value proposition. Indeed, the fact that GM shares are still low-priced is what makes this investment so appealing.Yet, there’s more to the story than a reasonable price tag. General Motors is quietly making inroads into future-facing ventures. You won’t get the fanfare like you see with Tesla, but “slow and steady wins the race” investors can take a position in GM stock for gradual gains.Admittedly, GM stock does not offer a dividend at the current time. So, income-focused investors might take issue with that.However, value seekers should like GM’s trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio. At 28.01, it is quite reasonable. (For comparison’s sake, Tesla stock’s trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio is a whopping 1,290.98.)GM stock was comfortably sitting between $34 and $35 prior to the onset of the novel coronavirus. Moreover, this stock has traded above the $40 level on numerous occasions in the past. It’s not inconceivable that the bulls can bring the share price back to those levels at some point.For the time being, the bulls’ primary objective should be to reclaim the crucial $30 level on heavy trading volume. Just as importantly, they need to keep GM stock above $30 in order to prove that they’re in control of the price action.If you have a notion that Tesla has a monopoly on the future of electric vehicles, think again. General Motors is showing that an old automaker can learn new tricks.Back in March, General Motors CEO Mary Barra declared her company’s intention to “transform product development at GM and position our company for an all-electric future.” That certainly sounds like General Motors is ready and willing to take on Tesla directly.We’re now seeing the signs of General Motors’ progress in this area. Reportedly, the Corvette Engineering team at General Motors is being moved out of the Global Products Programs segment and into the Autonomous and Electric Vehicles segment.Does this mean that we’ll see an all-electric Corvette on the roads tomorrow or next week? Don’t count on that. What matters here is that General Motors is pivoting towards an emphasis on electric vehicles, slowly but surely.Thus, perhaps General Motors’ “all-electric future” might happen sooner than we think. You’ve got to admit, a fully electric 2021 or 2022 Corvette would look awesome. Take that, Elon!I’ve spoken about the “ventilator trade” since the early stages of the Covid-19 crisis. When an arm of the government is a major client, then that’s a good sign for practically any investment.In the battle against the coronavirus pandemic, General Motors and its collaborator, Ventec Life Systems, have already supplied 30,000 V+Pro critical-care ventilators to the Department of Health and Human Services.This was a highly efficient operation, with the two companies fulfilling the 30,000-ventilator order in a mere 154 days. Amazingly, it’s been estimated that they made one ventilator every seven minutes or so.Barra proudly commented on this achievement, saying, “Our drive to put critical care ventilators into production was fueled by thousands of people at GM, Ventec and our suppliers who all wanted to do their part to help save lives during the pandemic.”General Motors is shifting, and investors are invited to participate in the company’s growth into new areas. This doesn’t mean that GM stock will explode like Tesla stock did, but steady returns can build wealth just like a sudden windfall can.On the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.The post Struggling General Motors Stock Should Be Firing on All Cylinders Soon Enough appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\n",

The stock, however, had been down by as much as 14.7% earlier in the day.The growth stock's decline likely reflects some investors taking profits after its enormous run-up in 2019 and 2020. Further, some investors may have been spooked by the news that the electric-car maker's largest institutional shareholder had trimmed its position.Image source: Tesla.It's not surprising that Tesla stock would take a breather. Between Aug. 31, 2019, and Aug. 31, 2020, the automaker's shares surged by 1,000%. Wednesday's decline was a continuation of a pullback that began on Tuesday, suggesting some traders are taking profits.It's also possible Tesla's sell-off on Wednesday was partly driven by news that its largest institutional shareholder, the investment management firm Baillie Gifford, had reduced its stake in the company from about 6.3% to 5%. Fund manager James Anderson said in a statement to the press, however, that the move was for structural reasons. Tesla stock had grown into too large a position in its clients' portfolios, exceeding the firm's concentration guidelines.The valuation of Tesla stock has certainly become difficult to justify.

      "Haber:  By Vera Eckert, Christoph Steitz, Tom Käckenhoff and Edward TaylorFRANKFURT, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Elon Musk appears to be opening a new front in the European battle for electric car supremacy: the power behind the wheel.Musk's Tesla TSLA.O has recently acquired a licence that will enable the carmaker to trade electricity across western Europe and the company has also been surveying customers in Germany about potentially using Tesla electricity in their cars.Such moves, consultants and energy industry executives say, could set the stage for the company - possibly with one or more partners - to take on established utilities in Germany, Europe’s biggest power market and autos heartland.Tesla declined to comment about its energy market plans.Generating and trading power could help Tesla lower the running costs of its cars at a time rival automakers, including Germany's BMW BMWG.DE, Audi NSUG.DE, Porsche PSCH.UL and Mercedes DAIGn.DE, are churning out new electric models.It could also step up competition to utilities such as Vattenfall VATN.UL and EnBW EBKG.DE, which are investing in electric mobility services too, but which like peers RWE RWEG.DE and E.ON EONGn.DE are lumbered with the cost of winding down fossil fuel and nuclear power plants. Tesla already sells solar panels and the Powerwall battery storage system for homes, but now appears to be looking at selling electricity directly to customers and using the home storage systems to provide services to the grid.In June, the company became a member of the Paris-based EPEX Spot power exchange, a platform used to trade much of western Europe's intraday cross-border electricity.A month later, it surveyed German customers about their interest in energy services.\"What would encourage you to switch from your existing energy supplier?\", the survey said, according to a copy seen by Reuters.\"Would you buy a Tesla photovoltaic system and home storage (Tesla Powerwall) if you could switch to a specially designed Tesla electricity tariff?\", it added.Tesla also asked potential energy customers whether they would allow the company to control when cars would charge.This could allow it to coincide charging with cheap electricity rates during off peak hours, consultants and industry executives said.It could also open the way for Tesla to use power stored by customers to help balance the electricity grid, an increasingly important service in Germany as it becomes ever more dependent on volatile wind and solar power.Companies offering similar services in Germany include Shell-owned RDSa.L sonnen, virtual power plant operator Next Kraftwerke, and power aggregator Lichtblick.Tesla's interest in renewable energy was one of the factors that led it to choose Brandenburg state around Berlin as the site for a new factory, a person familiar with the company's deliberations told Reuters.In the first half of this year, some 65% of the electricity on the Brandenburg grid was generated from renewable sources,  mostly wind. But like other areas in the north of the country, it often wastes energy because Germany's networks are limited in how much green power they can transport over long distances.Tesla's Gigafactory 4 in Brandenburg will on its own require 100 megawatts (MW) of power and up to 400 MW if battery cell production is also launched, according to transmission grid operator 50Hertz.Tesla is a long way from building up enough battery assets to deliver frequency regulation at grid scale, say specialists such as utility Axpo. But the company has made several steps to expand its energy activities in recent months.In May, it applied for a UK licence to supply power, according to the Telegraph newspaper. It also uses a platform to bring users of its solar and Powerwall battery system into the electricity market in Australia. \"The next and obvious step for Tesla is to get into production, especially of renewable power,\" said consultant Berthold Hannes, who has 30 years of energy advisory experience.\"Tesla could use its own locations, for example the roofs of plants or the sites of charging points, and alternatively, or in addition, it could take stakes in solar plants or wind parks,\" he said.Germany pioneered the solar power market, and is in the process of laying a policy framework that will make it easier for decentralised power generation and supply.\"Tesla's long-term plan definitely includes tackling the energy industry in a bigger way, though it's questionable whether it invests enough at the moment in that area,\" said a former member of Tesla management, who declined to be named.Thomas Deser, a portfolio manager at Union Investment, said it was unlikely Tesla would enter the German electricity distribution business on its own - \"but it could do so with a competent partner from the energy industry.\"(Reporting by Vera Eckert, Christoph Steitz, Tom Kaeckenhoff and Edward Taylor Writing by Edward Taylor Editing by Carmel Crimmins and Mark Potter)((Edward.Taylor@thomsonreuters.com; +49 69 7565 1187;))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\n",

      "If you thought the arrival of the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) splits would finally slow the meteoric rise in the Nasdaq, you’re in good company. But you’re also wrong.Tuesday’s 1.7% launch in the PowerShares QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) shows the much-anticipated splits have done nothing to slacken demand for technology stocks. Not yet, at least. Forecasting when the current upswing in QQQ will end continues to be an exercise of frustration.It’s insanely overbought, no doubt. But the virtuous momentum cycle is feeding on itself. Consider the stats of the advance. Since pivoting off of the rising 20-day moving average on Aug. 11, QQQ rallied for 15 sessions. There were only three down days along the way, and each of those was short-lived and shallow.So, what’s it mean for SQ? Well, it’s bullish. Square has the good fortune of residing in the strongest sector on the planet. That’s a tailwind that can’t be borrowed or bought. And it’s one of the reasons why the price trend in Square has been so consistent and long-lasting.Tuesday’s breakout was born on the back of the rally. If the Nasdaq suffered a rug-pull following the twin splits mentioned above, then I virtually guarantee SQ stock wouldn’t be flying 4% higher.Let’s take a closer look at the chart.\n",

      " The first thing that jumps out is just how reliable the 20-day moving average has been. Moving averages are the ultimate trend-following indicators. When used properly, they can keep you on the right side of the trend until the end. Note how many times SQ has pulled back and bounced off of the 20-day since April.The pattern developing over the past few weeks was a mini cup and handle formation. Resistance at $160 held firm for days, but ultimately, bulls won the contest, and we’re seeing their victory dance right now. Spectators have to be cheering (and likely chasing) the breakout here, if for no other reason than Square’s reputation for rewarding breakout buyers.In the daily chart, I’ve labeled all previous resistance zones to illustrate just how consistent the upside follow-through has been following each breach.There’s always the chance that the current pop is finally the one that fails. But I wouldn’t bet on it! Since we’re basking at record highs, projecting a target is more art than science. Rather than worrying about the ultimate destination of the trend, I suggest focusing on building an options trade that simply gets you exposure to the upside.Implied volatility is pushing higher alongside the price. The IV Rank now sits at the 34th percentile. It’s high enough to make spreads more attractive than buying calls. Bull call spreads, and bull puts are both attractive here. It just comes down to the desired probability of profit and payout.Bull Call: Buy the Nov $170 call while selling the Nov $180 call for a net debit of $3.90.The risk is $3.90, and the reward is $6.10. The probability of max profit is nearly 50%.Bull Put: Sell the Oct $145 put while buying the $135 put for a net credit of $2.30.The risk is $7.70, and the reward is $2.30.

      "Haber:   If you spend time looking at Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), you'll eventually come across this comparison: \"It's like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) early on!\" (i.e., it lacks sustained profits because it's reinvesting in the business, or it's actually a \"software/ platform company\").  It's understandable. After all, what company wouldn't benefit from the comparison to the juggernaut that Berkshire Hathaway vice-chairman Charlie Munger once called \"an utter phenomenon of nature.\" There are some superficial similarities. For example, both companies are headed by visionary leaders with seemingly no limit to their ambition for the companies they helm. However, there's one point of comparison that is never made, and it concerns the nature of their chief executives' compensation. Image source: Getty ImagesThe table below describes the cash components of Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos's compensation, along with some explanatory notes from Tesla and Amazon's proxy statements:$23,760\"Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, historically earned a base salary that reflected the applicable minimum wage requirements under California law, and he was subject to income taxes based on such base salary. However, he has never accepted his salary. Commencing in May 2019 at Mr. Musk's request, we eliminated altogether the earning and accrual of this base salary.\"$1,600,000\"Represents the approximate aggregate incremental cost to Amazon of security arrangements for Mr. Bezos in addition to security arrangements provided at business facilities and for business travel. We believe that all Company-incurred security costs are reasonable and necessary and for the Company's benefit [...]\"\"Mr. Bezos does not receive any compensation for his services as a director in addition to his compensation as Chief Executive Officer.\"\"Elon Musk, who is our Chief Executive Officer, does not receive additional compensation for his services as a director.\"Data Source: Company filingsAs far as cash compensation goes, the numbers are essentially the same. While Mr. Musk doesn't actually receive any cash, let's face it: $1.7 million  is a rounding error for a deca-billionaire. In fact, given Elon Musk's 193.3 million-share stake, that figure represents less than a $0.01 change in Tesla's stock price. But that's where the similarity ends.You see, Jeff Bezos receives no form of compensation beyond what is listed in the above table.  As Amazon's proxy statement explains,[d]ue to Mr. Bezos' substantial stock ownership, he believes he is appropriately incentivized and his interests are appropriately aligned with shareholders' interests. Mr. Bezos has never received any stock-based compensation from Amazon. (emphasis added).In other words, because he is already Amazon's largest shareholder, with 11.2% of the shares outstanding, Bezos believes that he is \"eating his own cooking\" and does not need any additional incentive to pursue his shareholders' best interests in his capacity as chief executive officer.Evidently, Elon Musk doesn't feel the same way with regard to his stewardship of Tesla, and neither do his directors.At the end of 2016, Mr.  Musk owned 22% of Tesla's shares outstanding. But with his \"2012 CEO Performance Award\" nearing completion, Tesla directors weren't convinced that a better than one-fifth stake in the company provided sufficient motivation to ensure his continued loyalty and diligence on behalf of shareholders. Thus, in early 2017, the board began discussions on \"how to continue to incentivize Mr. Musk to lead Tesla through the next phase of its development.\"By January 2018, following \"more than six months of careful analysis and development led by the Compensation Committee,\" the board granted Elon Musk the \"2018 CEO Performance Award,\" which was approved with approximately 73% of the shareholder votes cast by shares not owned by Musk or his brother -- and fellow Tesla board member -- Kimbal.The award vests in twelve tranches that correspond to $50 billion increments in Tesla's market capitalization, beginning at $100 billion. If all the required market capitalization and associated operational milestones are met, it would enable Mr. Musk to purchase an amount of shares equal to 12% of Tesla's total shares outstanding at the time of the grant, at a price of $70 (the then stock price, split-adjusted). Based on Monday's closing price of $498.32, each tranche has an intrinsic value of $3.6 billion. As of July 24, two tranches have already vested, and the company expects the third tranche to vest during the current quarter.If Tesla achieves all the required milestones to collect all twelve tranches, it'll have a market capitalization of over $650 billion, and investors who have owned the shares from the inception of the Award will have scored an extraordinary return. Surely Elon deserves to share in that success? To that question, I reply: Amazon wasn't the same. Jeff Bezos shepherded his company from an idea to a business with $1.7 trillion in market capitalization without receiving any stock-based compensation. His original stake in the company provided all the motivation he needed and all the material reward he could wish for if he succeeded. That suggests a difference in the two men's visions of their relationship with their shareholders. Or as Warren Buffett once said of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates:He's also never taken a stock option. I think this is true of Steve Ballmer as well. They got rich with their shareholders, not off of their shareholders.  Those different visions are echoed -- and sanctioned -- at the board level: Directors are responsible for devising a compensation program for the chief executive. The difference in corporate governance is one of the reasons why I believe that, despite the size differential between the two companies, Amazon's stock will outperform Tesla's over the next five, ten, and twenty years.  When all is said and done, I know with whom I'd rather ride.10 stocks we like better than WalmartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

By definition, this makes it a binary trade, so it is closer to gambling than investing. I consider any trades in it to be speculative bets inside a conservative portfolios.Source: Shutterstock\n",
      " This is the year of the virus, and the world is making things up was we go. Covid-19 was a novel virus, so even the experts are newbies at dealing with it.Today we examine one of those brave companies that are trying to rid us of this threat. SRNE stock has been a chop fest ever since the CEO Henri Ji made headlines in May claiming they could cure it. Since then, investing in Sorrento has required a neck brace and anti-nausea medicine to withstand the spikes and falls that this lively stock delivered.It is still up 125% year-to-date but that is a far cry from being up over 400% not too long ago. Nevertheless, the investment thesis has not changed much: Own Sorrento Therapeutics for a bet on their scientific success.I know this may upset a few fans, but fundamentally, it’s hard to justify buying stock in companies like this without being honest about the odds of it working out. It has a $1.8 billion market cap and hardly any sales. Clearly the entire upside potential lies in their pipeline.In the end, if they fail to deliver the results then the stock is too high now. Personally I prefer rooting for its success, because I want them to help the sick.The company deals with life and death, so the emotions while trading SRNE stock also run high. Negative opinions solicit aggression. If you want to test this thesis, try tweeting something bad about it and see how the investment community receives it. On the other hand, it also has a huge number of haters, judging by the 22% high short interest that it carries.Investors can and should do homework on the progress of the scientists to see who is gaining an edge. Even then, the bullish thesis should come with a warning that says “low conviction,” since we are at the mercy of the headlines.Why bother trading a binary opportunity like SRNE stock? Because of what we saw it do earlier this year, when it spiked 200% in May, then again another 125% in late July. The temptation is too great to pass up.This is especially true in the Robinhood era of investing. High-risk stocks are all the rage these days — just look at the bids chasing Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) this week. Clearly there is room to make money for those who can stomach the uncertainty that comes along with it.For that, I prefer using the options markets, where investors can risk less and create income opportunities with limited risk. For example, instead of buying 100 shares of SRNE stock, I can sell a $2 wide bull put spread at $6 and collect 80 cents per contract for it. To do this I sell the $6 put to open the risk and I buy the $4 put to limit it. If price stays above $6 through mid October then I would have created income without any money out-of-pocket.This trade offers a high yield of 60% and with much better chances than the binary outcome that the stock currently offers.\n",

      "Sorrento stock is 60% off its highs, but such is the nature of these stocks. The hope is that they are always one headline away from greatness. The SRNE stock technical setup is not ideal. The bulls failed to hold the $10 level last week. This was a important because it served as the basis for the 115% August rally. It is okay to give back some of the rally, but in this case the bulls went too far and relinquished all of it — and its breakout neckline as well.Going forward this becomes forward resistance, and onus is on the bulls retake it. This means that for the next couple of weeks, rallies into $10 are selling opportunities.Of course this is still a headline stock, and anything can happen.Until then, the assumption is that the stock is now in the hands of the bears and catching the proverbial falling knife becomes a risky proposition. There’s still hope for those long the stock. Support has held above the June neckline and above $7.40 last week. Investors who are still in the stock can feel better about holding here, as the stock finds its way out of this sharp descending wedge.The stock has been setting a series of lower highs as it knocks on said support. As long as the fundamental outlook holds, the stock should bounce out of the wedge. This is not a certainty, so caution is still warranted. Those who are looking to open new positions can do so while the stock finds its footing but not all at the same time. Leaving room to add more is smart, especially in a situation where a stock is a falling knife.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com. Join his live chat room for free here.

      "Haber:  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThanks to the groundbreaking Title III of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act, Americans now have access to equity crowdfunding ventures. To accommodate this radical shift in our laws, private investing platforms like MicroVentures have risen to connect burgeoning organizations with a new breed of speculators. Further, given the broader progression of technology, there’s never been a better time to invest in startups.Typically, when most people think about investing, they’re thinking about Wall Street and the major indices such as the Dow Jones or the S&P 500. But before publicly traded companies entered the big show, they first started off as an idea. From there, concepts turned into business propositions to high-dollar backers. What’s changed now with the JOBS Act is that the public can now invest in startups.For those new to the concept, these are some of the big picture reasons why you may want to consider investing alternatives such as equity crowdfunding:Although equity crowdfunding offers an exciting alternative to traditional investment vehicles, you should be aware of the myriad risks. Primarily, private securities have a limited marketplace. While MicroVentures does provide secondary trading, this arena isn’t nearly as convenient as trading blue-chip stocks as an example.Also, the majority of startups fail. Therefore, you should only invest capital that you can afford to lose. And it pays to have a diverse portfolio in case some of your bets don’t pan out.If you’re still onboard, here are five startups to consider on MicroVentures.Source: Shutterstock\n",
      " Usually, when individuals find themselves needing a loan, they turn to the big banks. Obviously, with the amount of resources that the banking giants have, they can collectively invest billions in advertising platforms. But what many don’t appreciate is that smaller, local institutions may offer superior rates. As well, because local institutions are part of the community, borrowers receive better service.With Lend-Grow, the company provides an online lending marketplace, serving to connect borrowers with local banks and credit unions. Here, Lend-Grow provides a win-win ecosystem. First, the borrower benefits from competitive rates. Second, local lenders can grow their portfolio with warm to hot leads which would otherwise be sucked up by the big banks.Better yet, major institutions see the value in Lend-Grow’s convenient, intuitive platform. For student loans and refinancing options, the company has partnered with Ascent Funding, INvestEd, Nelnet, and Citizens Bank. On the personal loans end, Lend-Grow has partnered with Blue Ridge Bank, with an anticipated launch in September 2020.Lend-Grow is currently accepting investments, with a minimum commitment of $100.

      " According to a Forbes’ article, just a fifth of the global workforce perform their jobs behind a desk. This translates to 2.7 billion people who make up the “deskless” workforce. Because of the nature of their jobs – raging from customer service to infrastructural operations – they may not have access to communication platforms that could enhance their productivity.That’s where goDeskless comes in. As a cloud-based software, goDeskless helps client organizations streamline their communication protocols through digitalization technologies. Further, by offering its services as a third-party vendor, goDeskless democratizes the deskless revolution.For instance, companies like Uber (NYSE:UBER) or Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) can end up spending millions to develop proprietary infrastructure to aid their deskless workforce. With goDeskless, more organizations can theoretically advantage the deskless business model, saving costs and promoting greater efficiencies.Plus, with the novel coronavirus disrupting the very nature of work, goDeskless has received a burst of relevance. Currently, goDeskless is offering convertible notes with a minimum investment of $100.Source: Shutterstock\n",
      " As an online car repair diagnostics tool and marketplace, The Car Savior may cause some concerns for those seeking to invest in startups with a longer-term upside pathway. Specifically, the surge of electric vehicles with their inherently more reliable platform may initially dissuade you. However, the facts suggest that The Car Savior may be far more relevant than you might think.Yes, companies like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) have proven that EVs are viable. Not only that, demand for Tesla vehicles has accelerated. Nevertheless, we’re talking about deliveries in multiples of thousands, not millions, as is the case with combustion-engine cars. Even in the depths of the Covid-19 crisis in April, total vehicles sold numbered over nine million.So no, combustion isn’t going away anytime soon. Therefore, you can invest in startups that are levered to “analog” automotive technologies.Furthermore, the pandemic may result in a prolonged recession. In that case, consumers will be more willing to invest in repairs rather than buying a new (or new to them) car. Thus, The Car Savior may have plenty of growth in the tank.Offering convertible notes, The Car Savior requires a minimum investment of $100.Source: Shutterstock\n",
      " We all know that Americans love their pets. So much so that the pet care industry has blown up into a $75 billion-plus industry. But does this love for our furry friends translate overseas? That’s one of the compelling questions driving India’s Petpal.Billed as a “one-stop online platform for Indian pet owners to get the food, medicine, and accessories they need to keep their pets happy and healthy,” Petpal represents an intriguing proposition among equity crowdfunding. As I stated, we know that Americans will do anything for their pets. Arguably most Americans would at least consider the idea to invest in startups associated with U.S.-based pet companies.However, India may be a potential gamechanger. As you know, the country has been a viable emerging market over the years. Even with the Covid-19 disaster, India may be able to eek out a 3% to 4% GDP growth rate in 2020. And the rise in economic power has meant that individual Indian consumers are enjoying luxuries such as pet ownership.So far, more than $61,000 have been raised from 132 investors. If you’d like to take a shot at Petpal, the minimum investment is $100.Source: Shutterstock\n",
      " Wind Craft Aviation is truly emblematic of the reason why so many invest in startups. Featuring a hydrogen-powered Electrical Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft, Wind Craft Aviation promises to be a disruptive force in the air transportation market.For one thing, the company’s eVTOL aircraft is powered by a carbon-neutral fuel cell, which of course is much more environmentally friendly than traditional aircraft. Further, the fuel cell is more efficient than traditional lithium-ion batteries, enabling greater range. Though the target aircraft looks like something out of a science fiction movie, the company has plans to launch its first test flight this year. In addition, the organization will start beta testing in foreign markets next year.Best of all, Wind Craft Aviation is getting serious attention. Notably, the company was awarded a grant from PlanetM to develop its eVTOL craft and test it at various military sites.Not surprisingly, investors are very keen to put their capital to work, with Wind Craft Aviation attracting nearly $226,000. If you want to take part in this equity crowdfunding opportunity, Wind Craft is currently accepting reservations.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

      "Haber:  It's fair to say that last month's stock splits for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA) were a success. Apple and Tesla shares rose roughly 30% and 60% respectively in the weeks following their split announcements, and they both shot higher on Monday after their splits went into effect. If you're a publicly traded with a stock price in triple or even quadruple digits what are you waiting for? Come on in. The water's fine. You're going to see a lot of companies go this route, particularly tech darlings or establishments with strong consumer-facing businesses. Let's go over a few of the copycats that could jump on the stock split bandwagon as early as this month.Image source: Getty Images.Apple and Tesla have avid fan bases, and the same can be said about Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG). The burrito roller has been rolling itself since it brought in Taco Bell's chief to run the show in early 2018, more than quadrupling in value over that time. We're now in four figures on the stock price. Chipotle knows that it doesn't need a low stock price to succeed in this era with zero-commission trading and fractional shares, but after seeing Tesla and Apple take after announcing their splits it makes sense to follow. Chipotle's bouncing back strong from COVID-19, and the pandemic has helped fortify its digital initiatives that will only grow in the future.The world's largest online retailer currently commands the third highest stock price on a U.S. exchange. It's not a good or necessary look for CEO Jeff Bezos. The richest man in the world gets a lot of heat from some social groups given his massive wealth, why keep a stock price approaching $3,500 to make it all seem even more out of reach?Keith Noonan offers a good argument for Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) to be the next tech giant to split its shares. Amazon dominates the e-tail turf, and it would become a more popular investment among its shoppers if it had a stock price that was as accessible as its competitive pricing on products and services. Google's parent company is another stock needlessly trading in the quadruple figures. The search and online services giant hasn't been as hot over the past year as Tesla, Apple, and most of the other names on this list but Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) lofty share will stand out like a sore thumb if other tech companies start following Apple's lead.Google's revenue slowed in 2019 to its slowest growth since 2015, and analysts see the top-line increase slowing to mid-single digits in 2020. A stock split won't spark accelerating revenue, but it could renew interest in the shares.  Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) joined the four-figure club for the first time this summer, and it's not likely to give up that status anytime soon. The e-commerce platform has become a popular choice for new and established businesses looking for a more intuitive way to sell things online. As the newest of the publicly traded companies on this list -- with just five years on the market -- we don't have a good read on Shopify's willingness to consider a stock split. It's not like Amazon that split its shares three times during the sudsy dot-com bubble days of 1998 and 1999. One thing for sure is that growth is on a tear at Shopify. Revenue in its latest quarter nearly doubled, soaring 97% on a 119% year-over-year pop in gross merchandise volume. If Shopify is confident that its growth will continue to impress it doesn't have a lot to lose in declaring a stock split. We travel from Shopify in Canada to MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) in Latin America to wrap up the list of stocks that are ripe for a stock split. MercadoLibre also finds itself in the four figures when it comes to its stock price. MercadoLibre started out as a modest platform to allow merchants to connect with customers, but the ecosystem has broadened into payment, fulfillment, and other related offerings. As MercadoLibre's wingspan has grown so has its tech prowess as well as its share price.Chipotle, Amazon, Alphabet, Shopify, and MercadoLibre don't have to split obviously. Their share prices are high because they have been successful growth stocks, and a zero-sum stock split shouldn't be a high priority. However, since the trend is now fashionable it could lead investors to question the companies with high price points that don't go this route. You don't want your confidence questioned, so it's just a matter of time before some if not all of these stocks announce splits of their own.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "Haber:  By Alwyn ScottNEW YORK, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Asian stocks were set to weaken on Tuesday following a softer Wall Street close while the dollar slipped as markets digested new Federal Reserve comments that suggested rates will stay low for an extended period.Australia's S&P/ASX 200 .AXJO lost 0.89% in early trading, while Japan's Nikkei 225 .N225 fell 0.22%,Hong Kong's Hang Seng index futures .HSI, HSIc1 lost 0.38%.Wall Street declines overnight were caused by month-end portfolio rebalancing \"rather than a new trend in equities,\" said Rodrigo Catril, senior FX strategist at NAB Market Research in Sydney.The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 ended in the red, while the Nasdaq rose solidly. The S&P gained more than 7% for the month to notch its best August since 1986 in what is traditionally a softer month for stock performance.\"After such a strong summer run we're reverting back to the old pandemic playbook, so we see tech outperforming,\" said Mona Mahajan, senior U.S. investment strategist at Allianz Global Investors in New York. \"Really, that's a defensive move as people think about stay-at-home more as we're heading toward that fall season.\"Investors in Asia await the release of China manufacturing data and an interest rate decision from the Australian central bank. While the Reserve Bank of Australia is not expected to change policy, its commentary on the economic outlook will be closely watched.Most stocks slid overnight, but chalked up another month of gains for August. U.S. tech shares rose again Monday, powered by stock splits that lifted Apple Inc AAPL.O and Tesla Inc TSLA.O.Providing some support to sentiment was AstraZeneca's AZN.L plan to enroll 30,000 participants in a late-stage study to evaluate its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, AZD1222. Vaccine news often lifts markets. Taiwan stocks could see a boost after the U.S. said on Monday it was establishing a new bilateral economic dialogue with the country, an initiative it said was designed to support Taipei.Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida on Monday expanded on Governor Jerome Powell's comments from last week, saying that under the U.S. central bank's new policy view, a low rate of unemployment does not on its own trigger higher interest rates.Last week, the Fed said its new strategy plan is to use higher inflation when the economy is robust to offset the impact of periods of weaker prices. The Nasdaq fared even better than the S&P for the month, up nearly 10% as it rallied for a fifth straight month.Monday marked the first trading day for the revamped Dow, with Salesforce.com CRM.N, Amgen Inc AMGN.O and Honeywell International Inc HON.N joining the 30-component index, replacing Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N, Pfizer Inc PFE.N and Raytheon Technologies Corp RTX.N. Honeywell ended the session lower while a move higher late in the day pushed Salesforce and Amgen into positive territory. In Asia, China's Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers' indexThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 0.79%, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 0.23%, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 0.68%.The dollar edged lower against a basket of major currencies early on Tuesday. The dollar index =USD fell 0.08%, with the euro EUR= up 0.02% to $1.1938.The Japanese yen strengthened 0.04% versus the greenback at 105.86 per dollar, while Sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.3364, down 0.04% on the day.Expectations that the Fed will keep interest rates low for an extended period kept the dollar soft, marking a fourth straight month of declines, its longest losing streak since 2017.GRAPHIC-Emerging markets http://tmsnrt.rs/2ihRugVGRAPHIC-MSCI's World Stock Indexhttps://tmsnrt.rs/2DcGXQDGRAPHIC-Global markets, asset performancehttps://tmsnrt.rs/3hJ4UOL(Reporting by Alwyn Scott and Herbert Lash; Editing by Sam Holmes)((alwyn.scott@thomsonreuters.com; 646-223-6132; Reuters Messaging: alwyn.scott.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\n",
