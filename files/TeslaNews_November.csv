0,"Nov 7, 2020 7:10AM EST","Most stocks tend to ebb and flow with the business cycle, but some of the best growth stocks are the companies that are set up well to ride multiyear trends and take advantage of changing conditions.It's usually tech stocks that are front-of-mind when investors think of companies that are able to ride the wave of change, but there are times when stodgy old industrials have the opportunity to jump on an unstoppable trend.Here's why we believe XPO Logistics (NYSE: XPO), NIO (NYSE: NIO), and General Dynamics (NYSE: GD) are three stocks that are well positioned to take advantage of long-term trends.Image source: Getty Images.Lou Whiteman (XPO Logistics): E-commerce had been taking an ever-growing piece of the total retail spending pie even prior to the pandemic, but COVID-19 has only accelerated the trend. More than $200 billion was spent on U.S. retail e-commerce sales in the second quarter alone, according to U.S. Census Bureau data, a 31.8% increase from the prior quarter.Still, e-commerce represented just 16% of total retail sales in the quarter. Growth might slow some once the pandemic is over, but retail seems destined to continue to move toward online sales, and that is going to create a need for a lot of warehousing and shipping capacity.XPO Logistics is well positioned to soak up a lot of that increased shipping demand. The company's XPO Direct service is a tech-fueled platform designed to help retailers better compete with the scale of Amazon by providing a suite of logistics products. The company expects Direct to be a $1 billion sales business by 2022, with opportunities for further growth from there.XPO flexed its e-commerce muscle in the recently completed third quarter, delivering results that easily outpaced expectations thanks to strong growth in last-mile delivery and supply chain management. Post-pandemic it seems likely that many retailers will look to outsource more of their warehouse and fulfillment operations instead of taking on the hassles in house, offering new opportunities for companies like XPO.E-commerce was a super-trend even before the pandemic, and XPO offers a lot of reasons for investors to get excited. COVID-19 has only emphasized the importance of online retail, and the shipping capacity needed to make it work. The growth will continue well past 2020.John Rosevear (NIO): NIO's stock has surged in 2020 as the company has gone from a near-broke start-up trying to survive to a stable, fast-growing automaker with big plans and ample cash to fund them. But that might just be the beginning of an impressive long-term growth story.  NIO's in an interesting spot. The market for electric vehicles in China is expected to absolutely boom over the next decade, and it's already seen as a leading up-and-coming ""cool"" brand. Deliveries of NIO's latest model, the sporty EC6 crossover, began in late September. Demand has been brisk. Image source: NIO.While NIO isn't the largest maker of EVs in China -- and probably won't be -- its upscale, tech-stuffed vehicles exist in a sweet spot of the market, where customers are willing to pay up for features and stying that NIO has so far been able to deliver. That upscale focus (and growing credibility with upscale consumers) means its chances of getting to profitability, and of having good margins after that, are quite strong. NIO will report its third-quarter results on Nov. 17. They should be quite good: Sales jumped over 150% in the third quarter, and the company now has plenty of cash in the bank after a series of funding rounds earlier in the year. I expect that CEO William Bin Li will share details about the next phase of the company's growth plan during the earnings call, and those could be a near-term catalyst for the stock. It's true that the stock looks expensive given NIO's current level of revenue. But if you think of NIO as a home-grown Chinese alternative to Tesla, which is an increasingly plausible way to describe the company, then the company's top line -- and its stock price -- could have a lot more upside from here. Rich Smith (General Dynamics): Last week I made the case for Huntington Ingalls being a good stock to invest in no matter who wins the U.S. presidential election. Because the U.S. Navy sits well below the 355 ships we need at a minimum to maintain adequate military presence in seas all around the world, it seems to me that the future will be very bright for anyone building warships for the Navy.Today, I still believe this. But since I've already explained why I think Huntington Ingalls is a good way to play that trend, today I'll turn my attention to Huntington's greatest rival in the defense industry: General Dynamics.Like Huntington Ingalls, General Dynamics does a lot of business building warships for the Navy. But unlike Huntington, GD is a more diversified player, also building tanks and armored personnel carriers for the Army, for example, and business jets for the civilian market. For risk-averse investors, this diversification is attractive -- but I think the core military shipbuilding business is still the most attractive aspect of General Dynamics, as the U.S. rivalry with China continues to grow.With luck, this rivalry will never come to an actual shooting war, but even if it doesn't, the U.S. Navy still needs to build a huge number of ships just to avoid inviting challenges at sea. Already, the Chinese navy has overtaken the U.S. Navy in size, and with China looking to double the size of its destroyer fleet by 2025, the disparity is getting bigger, not smaller.  Because of this, I see little to no chance of the Navy's budget being cut -- but rather see it growing over time, to the benefit of General Dynamics. With the stock now down 21% over the last 52 weeks, and trading at a cheap 12 times earnings and just one times sales, General Dynamics stock has finally become cheap enough to buy.10 stocks we like better than NIO Inc.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

4,"Nov 6, 2020 9:41AM EST","In the pantheon of exchange traded funds, one that is indeed growing as the industry evolves, there are lots of great stays, but a far smaller amount of legends.For the purposes of this conversation, I'll classify a legendary ETF has one that has $100 billion or more in assets under management, a status currently sported by just five ETFs, one of which is the Invesco QQQ (QQQ).QQQ, which tracks the famed Nasdaq-100 Index and turns 22 years old in March, has more than $131.1 billion in assets under management, an advantage of $50 billion over the sixth-largest ETF. Beyond heft, QQQ and the Nasdaq-100 are legends for more important reasons, not the least of which is sheer performance.Between Dec. 31, 2007 and June 30, 2020, the Nasdaq-100 Total Return (TR) Index, which accounts for reinvested dividends, returned a staggering 456 percent compared to 175 percent for the S&P 500 TR. The Nasdaq benchmark's average annualized returns were 630 basis points superior to those offered by the S&P 500 with comparable volatility.Talking about QQQ is a good segue to getting acquainted with one of its new stablemates, the Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 Fund (QQQJ).Nearly a month old, QQQJ tracks the NASDAQ Next Generation 100 Index, a benchmark that's essentially a proving ground for admission to the aforementioned Nasdaq-100. This is a strategy ETF issuers are finding success with one introducing a fund earlier this year focusing on the “next 50” or the 50 stocks closest to entry into QQQ and the Nasdaq-100.For its part, QQQJ is finding swift success. At less than a month old, it has nearly $136 million in assets under management, making it one of the stars of this year's crop of new equity-based ETFs while confirming the cache of being related to QQQ.The NASDAQ Next Generation 100 Index, QQQJ's underlying benchmark, is a new index, having debuted in August and while backtesting isn't always flawless, it does turn up some positives in the case of index. Backtesting QQQJ's index to Dec. 17, 2010 through Sept. 30, 2020 indicates returns of 271 percent compared to 209 percent for the Russell Mid Cap Growth Index and 106 percent for the S&P MidCap 400 Index, respectively.Comparing QQQJ to mid-cap ETFs and indexes is relevant because many of the fund's components are classified as mid caps are smaller large caps. For example, the fund's largest holding is cloud computing name Okta, Inc. (OKTA), which has a market capitalization of $30.50 billion (as of Nov. 5), putting it at the smaller end of large-cap territory.One of the primary factors in QQQ's success is the Nasdaq-100 historically featuring larger weights to truly disruptive, innovative companies than are found in rival domestic equity benchmarks. As just one example, Tesla (TSLA) is the seventh-largest holding in the Nasdaq-100 at a weight of almost 3.30 percent while it still isn't included in the S&P 500.The tradition of providing exposure to innovative names continues in QQQJ. Data confirms as much, For example, QQQJ components are likely to allocate two or three times more of their revenue to research and development than companies in traditional in mid-cap indexes.“Patent exposure metrics better than midcap benchmarks as well, with 38% of index constituents registering patent activity in one or more Disruptive Tech sub-themes over a recent 12-month period,” according to Nasdaq Research. “Not only are NGX constituents more likely to file patents than midcap benchmark peers, they also tend to file them in more areas of innovation, on average 3.7 sub-themes per active company.”Bottom line: QQQJ may live in QQQ's shadow for awhile, but it has the potential to overshadow more prosaic approaches to mid-cap stocks.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/big-shoes-to-fill-but-this-new-etf-has-the-goods-2020-11-06

China, where over 25 million vehicles were sold last year, is a crucial battleground for global automakers including Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, the biggest foreign player by sales volumes, GM and Toyota 7203.T as well as local leaders Geely 0175.HK and Great Wall 601633.SS.The country has seen an auto sales pick up in recent months following a COVID-19-induced slump, and authorities say they have largely brought the epidemic under control following its emergence in the central city of Wuhan at the end of last year.The expansion plan would also mark GM's first official sales in China of GMC vehicles, a premium brand in the group. Previously GMC vehicles were only sold in the country via unofficial grey importers.The imports will, however, not change GM's basic production strategy in China. It will still mostly sell vehicles made in China - for now, at least.""Depending on however we go we might make other decisions,"" Blissett said.GM has a Shanghai-based joint venture with SAIC Motor Corp Ltd 600104.SS making Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac vehicles. It has another venture, SGMW, with SAIC and Guangxi Automobile Group, producing no-frills mini-vans, which has started manufacturing higher-end cars.Blissett said GM expected ""a strong November and December"" in China after positive October sales.

10,"Nov 5, 2020 6:03PM EST","Thursday was another strong day for the stock market, extending the upward streak for major market benchmarks to four consecutive days. In stark contrast to the dour mood heading into the weekend before the U.S. elections, investors now seem to be far more comfortable with their view of what's likely to play out politically in the near future. That was enough to send the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), and Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) higher by 2% to 3% on Thursday.IndexPercentage ChangePoint ChangeDow+1.95%+543S&P 500+1.95%+67Nasdaq Composite+2.59%+300Data source: Yahoo! Finance.Overall, gains so far in November have been extremely encouraging, reflecting hopes that the U.S. economy will be able to bounce back from the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. The fact that investors are willing to bid up stock prices even without any real resolution in sight for the coronavirus crisis is noteworthy, but does it mean we should expect new all-time highs for the Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq soon? Or will markets reverse lower again?First of all, amid all the volatility, you might have lost track of where the major market benchmarks are right now in relation to their all-time highs. The Nasdaq Composite is the closest to its record. At 11,891, the index is about 1.5% below its intraday record, and 1.4% lower than its record close on Sept. 2.Image source: Getty Images.The S&P 500 has only a little further to go. At 3,510, it's a bit more than 2% below its intraday and closing highs from early September.The Dow has been the laggard of the trio of top indexes, largely because the influence of high-growth tech companies is far weaker among the 30 stocks that make up the industrial average. Closing at 28,390, it's almost 4% below its intraday record high as well as its closing record on Feb. 12 -- just before the coronavirus bear market began.It therefore wouldn't take much of a nudge to push all three stock market measures into uncharted territory. However, volatility works both ways -- and just as quickly as the market has risen this week, it could give up those gains once again and head lower.There are compelling arguments on both sides of the debate of whether the stock markets will head higher or lower from here. But the real issue is that if you're a long-term investor, you don't really have the right perspective if you're concentrating on the next short-term move for the Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq.What 2020 has taught investors is that the right stocks can soar under any circumstances. Companies like Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ: ZM), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), and Enphase Energy (NASDAQ: ENPH) took advantage of business opportunities available to them, and their stock prices have soared. Their performance has been relatively consistent even as markets have gone in both directions.Don't let yourself be concerned about whether markets are headed for a big drop or on the road to further gains. Invest and keep on investing, and you'll put yourself on track for a successful financial future no matter what happens in the days and weeks to come.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

11,"Nov 5, 2020 5:16PM EST","By Ernest ScheyderNov 5 (Reuters) - Livent Corp LTHM.N said on Thursday it would form a joint venture to buy Canada's troubled Nemaska lithium project and it had extended its supply agreement for the electric vehicle battery metal with Tesla Inc TSLA.O through the end of 2021.The company also posted lower-than-expected quarterly results, and its shares fell 3 percent to $11.50 in late trading.The Nemaska deal would help Philadelphia-based Livent boost lithium production as demand is expected to soar later this decade with electric vehicles going mainstream. The company has been openly searching for lithium deals in the past year.  Livent is joining with metals financier The Pallinghurst Group to buy half of Quebec Lithium Partners, which was formed earlier this year after Nemaska filed for bankruptcy projection. State-owned corporation Investissement Quebec will own the other half of the company.""Livent continues to focus on strengthening its competitive position so we can support our customers with their future needs,"" Livent Chief Executive Paul Graves said in a statement.The Nemaska deal is not without risk. Livent only operates one lithium project, a brine facility in northern Argentina where an expansion project was recently put on hold.

13,"Nov 5, 2020 12:46PM EST","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAfter last month’s sell-off, what’s next for Workhorse Group (NASDAQ:WKHS) stock? Shares in the electric vehicle (EV) play soared thanks to two potentially game-changing catalysts. But, as speculators take profit, and others start to doubt its prospects, it’s debatable whether now’s the time to buy WKHS stock.On one hand, despite its 50% decline, the stock is still up more than 400% year-to-date. And, given that the company’s major catalyst (winning the U.S. Postal Service’s $6 billion vehicle contract) remains in play, another parabolic move could be just around the corner.On the other hand, it’s possible investors are starting to share my bearishness for this stock. Sure, there’s still a pathway to further gains if the company wins the postal service deal. Yet, as more information has come out in recent weeks, there’s more evidence this company’s odds of scoring the contract remain slim.Another factor to consider: the prospects of Lordstown Motors (NASDAQ:RIDE). In anticipation of that EV company going public, investors bid up this stock, given Workhorse holds a 10% interest in that company.But, after going public, the EV pickup maker’s shares have tumbled from around $20 per share, to around $14 per share. I’m bullish on RIDE stock, but with the caveat its a cautious buy at best right now.If Lordstown shares continue to tumble, shares in this EV play will as well. So, does that make this a buy, or a sell? Given so much remains in the air, it’s best to avoid going long (or short) for now.Is Workhouse stock falling out of favor? Or, is it just taking a breather, after its epic run so far in 2020? The jury’s still out. Sure, some previously bullish analysts are now taking a more neutral position. And, with a recent “short report” from short-seller Fuzzy Panda Research pointing out the company’s shortcomings, there’s now more to back up the bear case.Yet, that doesn’t mean it’s a no-brainer to go short WKHS stock today. Why? While I believe it’s a long-shot, the postal-service catalyst is still on the table.As InvestorPlace Market Analyst Luke Lango discussed Oct. 26, a win by Workhorse for this contract could mean it becomes for delivery vans what Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is for passenger vehicles. Per Lango’s numbers, shares could soar to as high as $60 per share by 2024.With this in mind, the profits from going short now (around $15 per share) pale in comparison from the potential gains you could see from going long. Also, with many still chomping at the bit to profit from this EV play, any sort of positive news could pop the stock once again.Simply put, taking the short side today is not worth the risk. So, does that make Workhorse a screaming buy, after the recent 50% haircut? Not exactly. While there’s much that could propel this stock in coming years, we may have yet to reach the near-term bottom.Until we get a decision on the USPS deal, this company’s long-term prospects remain intact. In other words, while it looks overvalued on paper, the chances of it scoring the deal, and leveling up from upstart to up-and-comer, help justify its current valuation.However, that doesn’t guarantee the stock won’t head lower in the coming weeks. While the results of the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election may boost Lordstown shares, as well as Workhorse stock, it’s no slam dunk. In fact, a positive election result could still drive shares lower, if it winds up being a “buy the rumor, sell the news” type of situation.But, the election isn’t the only short-term driver at play. Back in October, postal officials pushed back the decision date for its new vehicle contract to December. Sure, there’s no reason to doubt the postal service will have a result by this new due date.Yet, there’s still a risk the decision gets delayed once again. If this winds up happening, expect WKHS stock to sink even lower.So, what’s the call on Workhorse? For those that are bullish, now may not be the time to dive into a position. Sure, the stock’s taken a dive in recent weeks, and after the pullback, today’s prices look like a temping entry point.But, considering the many near-term factors that could sink shares further, we may be far from the bottom. On the other hand, all it’ll take to send this stock back to $30 is a breadcrumb of good news. With this in mind, going short doesn’t look so wise either.The verdict? Whether bullish or bearish, sit on the sidelines with WKHS stock for now. Today’s uncertainty could clear up in the coming weeks.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not (either directly or indirectly) hold any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Thomas Niel, a contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single stock analysis since 2016.The post As Shares Pull Back, Take Your Time With Workhorse Stock appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/as-shares-pull-back-take-your-time-with-workhorse-stock-2020-11-05

14,"Nov 5, 2020 12:05PM EST","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInvestor bullishness for Nio (NYSE:NIO) accelerated after the company posted September and third-quarter 2020 delivery updates for investors. Nio stock fared so well that shareholders would have offset their losses from the drop in either the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq index in the last month.Accelerating growth for electric vehicles in China will benefit a small handful of firms. Nio’s continued development in autonomous driving will set it apart from its competition.Nio enjoyed a stock rally that began in June. After months of worrying about its solvency, the company reported strong sales in China. The end of the lockdown in the country led to a rebound in revenue. By September, Nio posted a 133.2% year-over-year increase in vehicle deliveries. For the three months ended September, deliveries grew by an impressive 154.3%, to 12,206 vehicles.Nio’s battery leasing offering will likely drive quarterly sales higher. The two EV models target an array of customer types. The ES6 is a 5-seater premium SUV, while the EC6 is a coupe SUV that it launched in July. And because the EC6 is available in three trims – sporty, performance, and signature – Chinese customers have plenty of choices.The 7-seater ES8, at US $67,783, is half the price of Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model X. This suggests that Tesla will have trouble building market share in China, despite strong performance in the last year.Besides its unit price superiority to Tesla, Nio’s Pilot performs better than Tesla’s auto-driving solution. Officially, Nio released the semi-autonomous technology in October. As Chinese customers compare Nio to Tesla, they will find that Nio’s assisted-driving solution is better suited for Chinese traffic conditions. CEO William Li said the company test-drove more than 300,000 kilometers (186,400 miles) across 30 major cities. With the map data collected, Nio’s self-driving EVs will fare better than Tesla’s Navigate on Autopilot. In August, it hired Ren Shaoqing, a computer vision expert and the co-founder of Momenta, a startup in the self-driving field.Chinese customers may decide to help their domestic brand, picking Nio over Tesla. Conversely, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) is a backer of Xpeng Motors (NYSE:XPEV). Xpeng will launch Xpilot 3.0, an assisted-driving software, in 2021. That will give customers another option to consider over Nio’s offering.Nio will report quarterly earnings reports sometime in the month. When it does, the company has a strong track record of beating expectations:Nio’s quarterly earnings results compared to expectationsChart courtesy of Stock RoverNio’s battery swapping offering is setting its subscription services apart from other firms. Instead of waiting for an EV to charge, Nio owners may swap the battery in only five minutes. This is a big time-saver for the busy Chinese customer and is a positive catalyst for increased sales in the quarterly period.Short-term traders may sell the stock on the pop but patient investors will get a bigger reward. In a 5-year discounted cash flow growth exit model, assume the following:Model courtesy of finboxNio would need to grow revenue by around 80% annually in the next five years. If it does, the stock has a fair value of $56.26. Readers may change the assumptions to come up with a different price target.Tesla enjoyed its strong rally throughout 2020 while Nio had a delayed start. Since Nio is still trading at a fraction of Tesla’s market share, the stock has room to grow. Higher sales in the next few years will support a valuation that is higher than where it is trading now.On the date of publication, Chris Lau did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. Chris Lau is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

15,"Nov 5, 2020 11:36AM EST","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInitially, the narrative for Hyliion (NYSE:HYLN) appears a relevant and convincing one. As one of the growing number of players competing in the alternative-energy transportation sector, Hyliion stock has benefitted from the hype machine that has pushed up many companies that made their market debut via a special purpose acquisition company.For one thing, millennials and Generation Z are all about companies that promote solutions for environmental, social and governance concerns. Indeed, we have a whole new investing acronym, called ESG, because of this trend. More importantly, consumers are willing to pay for sustainability. ESG isn’t just about tree hugging but putting your money where your mouth is.To that end, Hyliion has generated headlines thanks to its Hypertruck ERX. Powered by renewable natural gas and a fully electric drivetrain, the Hypertruck features two compelling advantages. First, the natural gas fuel source allows relatively quick refueling at CNG stations throughout the country. Second, on the road, the kinetic energy generated recharges the e-motors.For Hyliion stock to be successful, the underlying company must provide practical solutions that fleets can readily accommodate. While intriguing as a concept, we will not see a 100% pivot toward alternative-energy trucks tomorrow. Here, Hyliion offers modular hybrid systems that “can be installed on most major Class 8 commercial vehicles,” according to the company’s website.This provides the advantages seen in electric vehicles. These include regenerative braking along with an improvement in performance and overall fuel efficiency, while allowing fleets to maintain their traditional diesel-engine trucks.On paper, Hyliion stock sounds like a no-brainer. But questions regarding this emerging technology should make prospective buyers think twice.Of course, everyone should know that Hyliion stock is an incredibly speculative investment. In a backhanded way, organizations like HYLN allow gamblers to wager on what could be the next Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). But because Hyliion isn’t competing with Tesla directly, it lends some credibility for this otherwise risky venture.Unfortunately, while many companies attempted to take alternative-energy vehicles to the next plateau, only Tesla has demonstrated viability. That TSLA has been all over the map in recent weeks should be a source of concern. If a credible organization has been volatile, you can bet your ride with Hyliion stock won’t be smooth.Further, there is a possibility that the science underlining Hyliion may be exaggerated. Short-seller firm Bonitas Research says Hyliion’s claims about 30% increased fuel efficiency through its hybrid system is a lie. Bonitas also lists a history of failed pilot programs. As an emerging technology, you can expect hiccups along the developmental path.Now, I don’t want to spend too much time assessing a short seller’s accusations. However, Bonitas did bring up an interesting question: who is responsible when a diesel truck retrofitted with Hyliion’s modular system goes awry?Frankly, I’m not sure if fleet owners or truck manufacturers want to deal with modular systems from third-party emerging technologies. You’re just introducing multiple variables that may not be properly tested. And if I know anything about next-generation solutions, they never work cleanly out of the box.If something goes wrong with Hyliion’s hybrid systems, that could be detrimental to public safety. Remember, these are vehicles carrying massive payloads. Given such legal concerns, I’m not surprised that HYLN has printed gobs of red ink since late September.Even if the safety concerns were addressed and Hyliion’s claims of increased fuel efficiency were valid, the narrative for HYLN would still be troubled. Mainly, that’s because of the convenience factor. While there are thousands of CNG stations planned, the present reality is that such stations are concentrated in specific regions.Therefore, in order for natural gas-powered vehicles to transport across the country, the logistics will be challenging. And that’s just not a challenge that traditional diesel trucks must deal with. Their underlying infrastructure is both robust and complete.But with the question marks surrounding HYLN and its myriad claims, Hyliion stock just isn’t a great bet for most people. Let the volatility die down and let’s see if the company really has the right stuff.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

17,"Nov 5, 2020 9:45AM EST","As the solar industry starts to rebound from the downturn in demand caused by the pandemic, shares of solar innovator Enphase Energy (NASDAQ: ENPH) have soared by almost 50% since its second-quarter 2020 earnings call. However, with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio around 80  -- over twice that of the average S&P 500 company -- some investors see Enphase as an ""expensive"" stock. But that P/E difference just means that investors are expecting Enphase's future earnings to grow faster than those of the average S&P component. What is fueling investors' expectations? A look at the company's third-quarter 2020 earnings call reveals a few clues.Enphase Energy's new Encharge system. Image credit: Enphase Energy, Inc.During its Q2 2020 earnings call, Enphase set several key expectations for Q3 2020 and the second half of the year. Chief among them:Data source: Q2 2020 earnings call and company filings. All financial metrics are on a non-GAAP basis.  In addition, the company set an expectation of achieving an ""8% to 10%"" ""attach rate"" for its storage products by Q4 2020 and for ""strong sequential growth"" in its European business. These two metrics are important as Enphase has historically gotten over 80% of its revenue from its U.S. microinverter business. Strong growth from a new geography and from a new product category are key to the validating the thesis of strong growth in future earnings -- and I'll discuss these separately below. Here are five key takeaways from the recent earnings report. The company's Q3 2020 revenue came in 2% ahead of expectations. That's great, but this figure includes storage, and international revenue. The company's U.S., microinverter-only revenue was actually down 20% from the same quarter a year ago. This is slightly ahead of the 25% drop in demand for rooftop solar that some forecasters had been predicting due to COVID-19. While it is difficult to get all forecasters to agree on a prediction for the U.S. rooftop solar market in 2020, the expectations going into Q3 were definitely conservative, and Enphase's better-than-expected drop in US microinverter-only performance prompts optimism. The company beat its gross margin goal for the quarter by 1 percentage point and its stated goal for the year by 6 percentage points.  This is one of the most important takeaways from the company's Q3 2020 earnings call. Not only was the company able to beat its revenue goal, but it did so while maintaining pricing power -- or its ability to control the prices of its products -- in an environment of limited demand. What this usually means is that the company is making a product that is different in ways that the market is willing to value.  On the storage side, the company shipped meaningful volumes of its brand-new product, Encharge. This product is priced at a significant premium over those of better-known incumbents. For example, on a $/kWh basis, Enphase's storage system is over 50% more expensive than Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) Powerwall -- the current industry leader. A surge in demand for storage products on the West Coast of the U.S. may explain in part the company's ability to command such a hefty premium.However, management's track record of consistently beating its margins goals over the last three years is quite impressive -- especially when compared to direct competitor SolarEdge (NASDAQ: SEDG).Enphase versus SolarEdge gross margin over the last three years. Data by YCharts.The company was able to keep its operating expenses, or OPEX, at under $30 million, or within the range of the expectations it set during its Q2 2020 earnings call. This is important for two reasons: It means the company did not beat its revenue goal by simply spending beyond its plans on things like staffing, travel, or marketing; and it means that the company was able to continue to outperform its baseline financial model of ""35-15-20"", -- 35% gross margins, 15% OPEX, and 20% operating income as percentages of revenue. Batteries are a new product for the company, and one that could help deliver the additional revenue growth that investors are pricing into the company's valuation. During its Q2 2020 earnings call, the company stated it expected to achieve a ""storage attach rate,"" or the percentage of rooftop solar systems that also include the Encharge battery system, of ""8% to 10%"" by fourth quarter 2020. Using the company's Q2 price assumptions and doing a little more math, an 8% attach rate should boost the company's microinverter-only revenue by about 27%. As stated above, in Q3 2020, the first full quarter of Encharge shipments, storage contributed 10% to the overall revenue, or $17.85 million. This represents a 14.7% boost to its U.S.-only microinverter revenue -- the only region where Encharge currently ships. 14.7% is a little over halfway to 27% -- so the company appears well on its way to meet the goal of ""8% to 10% attach rate"" by Q4 2020.The company's European revenue grew by 67% from the previous quarter, which qualifies as strong sequential growth by any definition, and gets the company closer to its goal of doubling its European revenue by year's end. Interestingly, overall international revenue growth was very healthy -- about 56% from the previous quarter and 36% from Q2 2019.During Q3 2020, Enphase delivered a beat on its two most important financial metrics -- revenue and gross margin -- while keeping OPEX in check, and showing it is on track to meet or beat its revenue goals for its new storage product and accelerated growth of its international footprint. The successful introduction of this new product alone creates a brand-new revenue stream that should add almost 30% to the top line of a company already growing at a healthy clip. Additional new products discussed during the call should produce further top-line growth in 2021.If the company can continue to meet or beat its commitment to 35% gross margins and its overall financial model, it should be able to exceed investors' expectations of outsized earnings growth reflected in its high P/E ratio. Investors considering investing in Enphase Energy would do well to monitor how storage and international revenue continue to grow and whether the company continues to beat its gross margin goals.10 stocks we like better than Enphase Energy, Inc.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

18,"Nov 5, 2020 8:37AM EST","Nothing inspires heated debate among investors like Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). From its controversial CEO, Elon Musk; to the designs of its vehicles (seriously, what's up with the Cybertruck?); to simple questions about its balance sheet -- everyone seems to have a strong opinion about the world's largest carmaker by market cap. For now, let's look at one of the most important questions for investors thinking of buying Tesla shares: Is Tesla overvalued? It sounds like a simple question, but there's more to it than meets the eye.Image source: Getty Images.If you just look at Tesla's raw numbers, it's hard not to come to the conclusion that the company is way overvalued. Let's look at the most common valuation metric: the price-to-earnings ratio. For good measure, we can also check out the enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio and the price-to-sales ratio. Here's how Tesla compares with other major automakers, including No. 2 Toyota (NYSE: TM), General Motors (NYSE: GM), and luxury carmaker BMW (OTC: BAMXF):TSLA PE Ratio data by YCharts.One of these things is not like the others, am I right? Tesla's valuation metrics are between eight and 23.6 times those of its nearest competitor by each metric (lower is better). That's despite those other carmakers selling vastly more vehicles than Tesla does; even BMW, the smallest by market cap, delivered 675,680 cars in Q3 2020, nearly five times as many as Tesla's 139,300.Any way you slice it, Tesla looks obscenely overvalued.Tesla bulls don't dispute that, compared to other automakers, Tesla's valuation is insane. However, they argue, Tesla shouldn't be compared to other automakers. For one thing, Tesla's sales are growing by leaps and bounds, and as those sales skyrocket, valuation metrics will come down. It's not unusual for a fast-growing company to have a much higher valuation than an established player in a given industry. Another common argument from Tesla bulls is that Tesla isn't just any old automaker: it's actually a tech company, so it should be evaluated against other tech companies. CEO Elon Musk clearly agrees. On Tesla's Q3 2020 earnings call, Musk expressed his belief that ""there's in excess of a dozen start-ups effectively in Tesla,"" including developers of microchips, battery cells, superchargers, and autonomous driving technology.Certainly, when we compare Tesla's price-to-sales ratio to some other hot stocks in the tech sector, its valuation looks much more reasonable:TSLA PS Ratio data by YCharts.The price-to-sales ratio is the only usable metric for comparison here because many of these companies, including Shopify, aren't yet profitable. However, Tesla's P/S ratio even compares favorably to fellow electric carmaker NIO and established graphics processor specialist NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA).Tesla is the largest of these companies, with a market cap of about $370 billion, but NVIDIA isn't far behind, with a market cap of about $308 billion. However, by other valuation metrics, Tesla fares much worse against NVIDIA:TSLA PE Ratio data by YCharts.A higher P/E ratio makes sense for Tesla because it has vastly more depreciable assets than NVIDIA, but even going by the EV-to-EBITDA ratio, which strips out depreciation, NVIDIA sports a superior valuation. NVIDIA, though, has been around a lot longer than Tesla. So, the question seems to be: is Tesla more like fast-growing start-ups Zoom Video Communications or Shopify, or more like established players NVIDIA or Toyota?This isn't an easy question to answer. Certainly, Tesla has an advantage over many of its competitors in the electric vehicle space in that it's been manufacturing electric cars for a long time and thus has experience with the relevant technology, design challenges, supply chains, etc. It also may have a major leg up in terms of technology and patents.However, competition in the space is about to get fierce, with new electric vehicle start-ups and established auto companies bringing a flood of battery-electric vehicles to market between 2021 and 2023. Other start-ups are focused on specific aspects of vehicle tech, like Hyliion's electric drivetrains and Velodyne's lidar technology for autonomous driving. Tesla, though, has a wild card in the form of its non-automotive businesses, Solar Roof photovoltaic shingles and Powerwall and Megacell energy storage technology. Neither one is currently making significant contributions to Tesla's bottom line, but each could be a significant source of profits down the road, depending on how things shake out.Tesla's clearly no bargain, and seems to be richly valued. Whether you think it's overvalued depends on what kind of growth you expect to see in Tesla's vehicle sales, its technological advances, and sales and development of the company's non-vehicle products. I tried to game out the likelihood of different growth scenarios and gave up; there are just too many variables in this fast-moving industry. However, Tesla's growth potential probably earns it a higher valuation than a legacy car company. That said, a lot of growth seems to be priced into the stock, which has had a tendency not to move in tandem with the company's fundamentals.Bottom line: value investors should probably steer clear, and even growth investors should be aware that things may not go according to plan.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Positive news surrounding its Alzheimer drug was the catalyst.Although the stock made some major moves — like clearing wedge resistance, as well as its 10-week, 20-week, 50-week and 200-week moving averages — it continues to struggle with the $360 to $370 area.This level has been resistance for years, including earlier in 2020 too.If Biogen can rotate over this year’s high near $375, it opens the door to the $400 mark and the 123.6% retracement near $406.Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) has become a Wall Street darling, roaring higher throughout 2020. Can it continue its momentum when it reports earnings on Thursday after the close?Luckily for bulls, this one has been pulling back. Nothing is harder than when a red-hot stock screams higher into earnings. The stock has been undergoing a very orderly pullback for weeks now, with support coming into play at $110.From here, bulls are looking for a larger dip to buy or a breakout to regain momentum.If it’s the former, look for a decline to channel support and the 50-day moving average. An overshoot could land Peloton near the demand zone (support), between $95 and $100.If it’s a bullish reaction, though, look for PTON to break out of the channel and reclaim the 20-day moving average. Over $125 and the $140 highs may be possible.General Motors (NYSE:GM) will also report earnings on Thursday, but will do so before the open.This will be a very interesting earnings report, even though GM doesn’t exactly command the attention that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) does.In October, GM finally broke out over the 200-week moving average. This mark had been notable support for years before turning into resistance earlier this year. Back above it now, bulls need to see this mark act as support should GM decline on Thursday.Below the 200-week moving average puts $32 back on the table, followed potentially by a test of the 50-week moving average.On the upside, it would be bullish to see a rotation over last month’s high near $38, putting $40-plus in play.With all of the election news, it was easy to overlook the fact that Wendy’s (NASDAQ:WEN) reported earnings on Wednesday morning.This slow but steady name has been holding above the 200-day moving average for months now. That said, it’s been mostly trading in a sideway pattern.If this name loses $21.50 support, the 200-day moving average and is back in play. A close below the September low at $20.23 gives bears even more momentum.Bulls can’t regain momentum with shares below the 50-day and 100-day moving averages. A push back through that mark puts downtrend resistance in play. If Wendy’s can close above this mark, a rotation up through $23.50 is possible — this month’s high so far — followed by a possible rally up toward $25.On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.The post 4 Top Stock Trades for Thursday: BIIB, PTON, GM, WEN appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-top-stock-trades-for-thursday%3A-biib-pton-gm-wen-2020-11-04

21,"Nov 4, 2020 2:31PM EST","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn my discussion regarding Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) in early October, I mentioned that the mathematical relationship between PLUG stock and shares of electric vehicle giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) was still very much intact.By that, I meant that two stocks shared an incredibly strong correlation coefficient. As TSLA found its way close to the moon, so too did Plug Power.For multiple reasons, the relationship appeals to investors of alternative energy solutions companies.Primarily, a psychological factor is in play. As you know, TSLA trades at around $400. That’s despite TSLA’s 5-1 split that made each unit “cheaper.” While that has allowed prospective buyers an easier road to acquiring full unit ownership as opposed to fractional ownership, $400 is psychologically a much larger hill to climb than $16.34, which is a recent price of PLUG stock.Second, even ardent Tesla bulls must figure that they risk some significant correction ahead, perhaps more severe than the broader EV correction that we’ve seen recently. While EVs have become much more mainstream than ever before, PolicyAdvice.net notes that on a global scale, only one in 250 cars is electric. Thus, you don’t want to buy into TSLA thinking that you’re immune from potential downside.But with PLUG stock, the narrative of the perpetual bull is presently much more acceptable. Although shares have enjoyed a meteoric performance this year, the underlying organization has long disappointed stakeholders. Therefore, you can make the argument that the technological paradigm is just now robust enough to make Plug Power feasible.However, it’s unusual for two companies on somewhat opposite ends of the spectrum – Tesla as the established EV leader and Plug Power as the bumbling upstart that’s finally bringing its alternative energy solution to the forefront – to track each other indefinitely.Naturally, investors want to know, does the relationship still hold a little more than one month later?Perhaps the answer to the above question won’t be satisfying, which is maybe.In the year-to-date through Nov. 2, PLUG stock and TSLA still share a strong correlation coefficient at 96%. But over the last several weeks, the relationship hasn’t tracked as well as before. Between Sept. 24 through Nov. 2, the correlation coefficient dropped to 59%.To be clear, a 59% correlation strength is still robust enough to indicate a mathematically significant relationship, as you can see for yourself by eyeballing the above chart. However, the change in strength of relationship (the delta for all the folks that love business-speak) is also significant.So, what explains the almost rude transition from 96% to 59%? For Tesla, it’s a bit easier to answer. As you know, the economic recovery from the impact of the novel coronavirus has not been enjoyed equally. In many ways, the pandemic has been beneficial for the well-to-do (no commuting, for example). Thus, these folks have upgraded to luxury brands in their automotive purchases, as the Wall Street Journal explained.But with the contentious 2020 election along with the possibly prolonged social unrest, discretionary retail demand might decline. As well, soaring coronavirus infections have spooked traders, causing them to dump out of retail-exposed positions. Therefore, TSLA along with other EV plays weakened, including PLUG stock.What has made investors more confident in Plug Power, though, is that the period between Sept. 24 and Oct. 7 has been phenomenal. Over the same time frame, TSLA was largely loafing around. Thus, it seems like PLUG can continue plugging ahead.However, the company is also levered to the discretionary retail market through its e-mobility solutions. That’s why you may not want to get too comfortable with PLUG stock.Still, before I get inundated with hate mail, it’s important to point out that e-mobility does give Plug Power some insulation from the headwinds impacting EVs and alternative-fuel vehicles in general. With e-commerce receiving a sensational lift due to the new normal, PLUG stock can still theoretically ride this momentum.Put a gun to my head (as I’m sure some of you want to do) and I’ll say that the technical picture for PLUG doesn’t appear as damaged as Tesla’s. On that, I think investors can take a cue and buy some of this discount.Nevertheless, I can’t emphasize this enough: you should keep the powder keg dry. While I wouldn’t recommend shorting PLUG, the next few weeks will be fraught with tension. Thus, this may not be the only discount to advantage.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

22,"Nov 4, 2020 2:13PM EST","In this episode of Rule Breaker Investing: Mailbag, Motley Fool co-founder David Gardner goes through some comments, poetry, and mailbag items from the Fool community. David gets into the nuance of doubling down versus adding to the winners and how it can be different for different individuals, the power of randomization, a story of courage and conscious leadership, a new Motley Fool podcast, and much more.To catch full episodes of all The Motley Fool's free podcasts, check out our podcast center. To get started investing, check out our quick-start guide to investing in stocks. A full transcript follows the video.10 stocks we like better than WalmartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have an investing tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Walmart wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.See the 10 stocksStock Advisor returns as of 2/1/20This video was recorded on October 27th, 2020.David Gardner: ""Dear, David, I never get tired of listening to you, in fact, I listen to your podcast while driving to-and-from work regularly. Although I'm in a Tesla, I still try not to type emails while driving. I've been a member since the Duke St. days and want to thank you, and all The Fools, for helping make me smarter, happier, and richer, but poor Rick needs some support. I think 50 minutes is an ideal length for the podcast, so Rick can sleep peacefully away from his office. Fool on! David Callanan.""Well the gauntlet has been tossed this week, can I do it? It's a mailbag episode, traditionally my longest and deepest. Last month's was really too long, my longest ever, 1 hour 27 minutes. Poor Rick, [laughs] I agree, can I do a mailbag in under 50 minutes? Looking backward, you can obviously already see the answer, but living forward, I can only try. [Yoda Voice] Wait! No try not, do or do not, there is no try. [Yoda Voice] Under 50 or bust, only on this week's Rule Breaker Investing.Welcome back to Rule Breaker Investing, a special episode of our mailbag, because it's designed to be one of the shorter mailbags in memory, and yet, we are still so info rich, so much fun ahead. One thing I will not have fun with is guest stars this particular mailbag, maybe it's because I'm kind of by myself right now at the beach, but I'm just going to, kind of, do it myself. More stream of consciousness than usual, and yet, still hot takes from Twitter, still eight solid Rule Breaker mailbag items, all that packed in, I hope, I've committed to under 50 minutes.I should mention what we've done in the month that was. By the way, Happy Halloween! A few days early for those who celebrate Halloween, and darn it! I hope you do get outdoors with a mask on, maybe two masks on, and have fun in whatever way you can safely and responsibly do tricks and/or treats.Well, the month that was October 2020, we led off with Essays from Yesterday, Vol. 2, my delight to share those with you. Second week was Mental Tips, Tricks and Lifehacks, Vol. 5. And then last week, memorably, my interview with Shirzad Chamine, Positive Intelligence.And I like to lead off with hot takes from Twitter reacting to the month that was, and got some great feedback from last week's podcast. Here are just a few of the items we received, ShipOfFoolsGD @fools_gd. ""Wow, is all I can say! This week's podcast with Shirzad Chamine #PQ was possibly the best episode yet. I feel like I could listen every 5-10 days!"" ShipOfFoolsGD goes on, ""I scored in the high 50s so the future is bright if I keep at it.""Harley Carrol @HarleyMCarroll ""57 years of trying to figure myself out and it takes an investing podcast to put me on a new path of discovery! Wow. Thanks @DavidGFool and @RBIPodcast.""Well, really, it's thanks to Shirzad Chamine, but thank you, Harley.And Arash Radparvar, @DrRadparvar on Twitter. ""@DavidGFool absolutely loved today's @RBIPodcast. Thank you @ShirzadPQ for sharing your insights and stories. I've always thought of the @RBIPodcast as timeless lessons, not only in investing but also in life. Always worth relistening for a happier, smarter, and a richer life. Fool on, my friends!"" Thank you, Arash.And finally, stockpanther, rocking the @Hail2stocks screenname on Twitter. ""Completed PQ score and Saboteur Assessment. 67 PQ and I am a restless, hyper-rational person. Admittedly too rational sometimes, and working on showing more sympathy and empathy to others. #fool #Positiveintelligence""Well, a wonderful way to summarize last week. It was a mixture of Foolishness and positive intelligence. It was made possible by a very special person, Shirzad Chamine. And I know you all enjoyed it, and I can see, stockpanther, in your case, you went right on, took the PQ score and the Saboteur Assessment, you didn't just listen, you learned and acted, and I love your resolution to show some more sympathy and empathy to others.We all can look at our saboteurs, can't we, and think about how we could make them smaller. They'll never go away, as Shirzad said, the voices will always be there, but you can make them smaller. Another theme for Twitter tweets in the month of October were 5-Stock Samplers, we had some amazing moves made by some of our past stocks picked and active 5-Stock Samplers. These are, again, all stocks in the Rule Breakers service in the Stock Advisor service, members know them. These samplers are just a small helping of some of these, enticing you, I hope, to come join us in the wonderful walled gardens of Motley Fool Rule Breakers and Motley Fool Stock Advisor, where we can serve you best. But I love this tweet from one of my fellow Fools, actually, Anand Chokkavelu, Anand who works here at The Motley Fool and spoke on this podcast a few weeks ago. ""The percentage of these 5-stock samplers beating the market (not just this year but all-time) is truly amazing. Also, I believe the coronavirus pack convinced me to buy Peloton, so thanks!""Well, thank you, Anand, thank you for all that you do.You know I do keep active stats, nobody cares more about my 5-Stock Samplers than me, you're allowed to tie me if you really love them, you can be tied with me, but I track them all. And it is a better version of myself, I can say, each 5-Stock Sampler, we've done 26 of them, and indeed 23 are beating the market, which is a hit rate of 88.5%, which is higher than any hit rate I've ever had in any other context. It's so much fun to pick these stocks for you and to see how they do over time, to track them in the most Foolish manner as we've done for years and years at The Motley Fool, really since we started in 1994, tracking how we're doing.And you know, with elections on our minds coming in November here in the United States of America, I'm thinking again about America's five core values and those five stocks that I picked representing each of those five core values, that was the June 10 stock sampler from this year, a remarkable group of companies, and outstanding performance. I want to mention one, in particular. Before I do, I'll just point out that the five stocks picked for America, which is about four-and-a-half months ago, stock market is up 6.2%, that's the S&P 500 gain, this group of five stocks is up 40.1%. Not a bad four-and-a-half-month return, but driven most of all by the Boston Beer Company (NYSE: SAM), ticker symbol SAM. When I think of freedom and I think of some of the founding fathers like Samuel Adams, how could I not pick the Boston Beer Company. To think that it has more than doubled is a shocker to me, it was at $523.87 when we picked that 5-Stock Sampler less than six months ago. Today it's gone from $523 to $1,075. I realize people are probably buying more alcohol than usual in the year of 2020. So, it appears that ticker symbol SAM is a beneficiary, but really the reason I wanted to single out SAM is not just for its exceptional performance, Etsy also a wonderful performer for this 5-Stock Sampler, we'll be reviewing it next June, but I wanted to mention that Sam is also distinguished as a company that is memorable for a miss on the Market Cap Gameshow.You may remember, a couple of shows ago one of our contestants greatly overestimated the market cap of the Boston Beer Company. And I said to that good person at the time, you know, this reminds me of the performance of Etsy from years ago when Matt Argersinger kept guessing Etsy's market cap wrong. Again, guessing Etsy's market cap much higher than it actually was at that point. True here again of Boston Beer Company in 2020. You know, when people think the market cap is much larger than it is, maybe that's a pretty good indicator, we've occasionally wondered aloud on this podcast, maybe that's a pretty good indicator that you should take a hard look at that stock, because in your own mind, if you way over-guessed its market cap, it should be, or maybe you thought was a lot larger than it is today, so maybe you're finding a hidden gem. And certainly, Etsy has proven that over the years for all Rule Breaker fans, and Boston Beer, SAM, the most recent big miss on a market cap game show.One other tweet relevant to 5-Stock Samplers, @Flosser40000654 at Flosser Invest. ""I remember listening to the podcast, ... "" this is the 5 Stocks for Coronavirus done earlier this year, which is the greatest performing 5-Stock Sampler yet. Flosser says, ""I remember listening to the podcast, out in the rain on a run during the heart of the pandemic as things were getting bad. Gave me some solace. Incredible. I own all five of these and they are worth holding for far longer...""Well, their 235% return has been well [laughs] in excess of anybody's expectations, mine most of all, but I certainly agree that all five of those companies are companies that I would love to hold from this point over the next 10 years. And given that our 5-Stock Samplers are people with stocks that are active recommendations from our services, and we have those over years, yeah, they are all still actively recommended. And while the market may sell off postelection, 2021, 2022, you tell me when you think the market will sell-off next, it doesn't matter to me too much, it never feels good, but I just keep holding all the way through as we have done for 27 years and counting at Fool.com. So, whether these companies keep rising from here even further or give back gains and come back later, I know one thing, I like all five of those, I like all stocks from all of my samplers, just about, from this point forward.Two final tweets, one from Eugene Ng. Eugene, I'm not going to call this a haiku, because I don't think you're shooting for that, but it is poetic in its own way. Thank you for this. You said this is inspired by our podcast. You said, ""Anticipate, don't expect. Look forward, don't forecast. Strive toward the future, don't dwell on the past. Know you can be right & you can be wrong. Winners will be up more than the losers will be down."" Thank you for that.And the last tweet I'll mention is just a fun one, pure fun from Collin Dando @cadando on Twitter. ""@RBIPodcast I'm loving @DavidGFool made my birthday (February 4th) #WinWinWinDay. I'll take it and try and live up to the honor and celebrate with you.""Well, thank you, Collin, you're reacting to our Mental Tips, Tricks, And Lifehacks, and one of mine that I contributed was: Make your own holidays. And I explained in that podcast earlier this month, why February 4th, for me is win-win-win day, why it is and why I think everybody should consider, even if you don't want to celebrate with me and Collin, that we will be celebrating next February 4th, win-win-win day. Celebrating your own holidays, making your own mark on the world, thinking about what really matters to you, naming it, dating it and celebrating it on a recurring basis each year with family and friends. Feel free to take the day off on your own holiday, that's what I say.All right. Well, let's move from the past reflecting on what we did over the course of October 2020, and now let's start creating the future together with this month's eight Rule Breaker mailbag items. First one up, love this one, thank you John Flood. ""Hi, David, although I've had my foolish times ... "" that would be the bad kind of foolish times. John goes on, "" ... I was rescued by Stock Advisor many years ago, and I'm still a very happy member today. I was also a Global Gains and Hidden Gems subscriber in their day, replacing them with Rule Breakers. Most recently, I've joined the ultimate financial voyage with the Blast Off 2020 crew, steered by those two superb pilots, Emily and Aaron."" That would be Emily Flippen and Aaron Bush, analysts whom I greatly enjoyed working with, both on our Rule Breakers team, and now they've gone on to do some of their own greatness together, and occasionally come back to this podcast.Well, John, you go on, ""I had the immense pleasure of visiting Fool HQ back in October 2008, a time of market gloom and opportunity boom if you had the nerve. Thanks to several Foolish conversations on that day, I sold nothing and dipped my toe into four battered but still brilliant businesses. These were some of the best decisions of my financial life. You made me both smarter and richer with a few deft strokes that day.""Well, I don't remember that day, John, but I am so delighted that you were with us. Fool HQ will reopen at some future point, and members are always invited to see if they're coming through town if they'd like to come tour our offices. Well, not in 2020, anyway, because they remain closed for the year, but how about 2021, we'll see.""I love your podcast for its subject variety, the constant sense of learning, your unflinching enthusiasm, your equally engaging guests. Last week, October 21st, 2020, was a lovely example of the fare on offer. You introduced us to Shirzad Chamine, a courageous man with an amazing story, who overcame childhood adversity, political hardship, and depression, only to start all over again with incredible success in the USA. I had never heard of Shirzad before, but I have now. And I've learned that my three saboteurs ... "" John says, "" ... are avoider, pleaser and restless. You do educate constantly.""Well, thank you, John. Of course, especially when I have guests to the show, the education is coming from them, their great works, their books. I hope I took pains to mention last week that I haven't actually read Shirzad's book Positive Intelligence. I'm sure it's a great book. I just wanted to share him with you because I had seen the online saboteur quiz, that was my in with Shirzad, so I was discovering a lot more about him along with all of you, I have not read his book, it was more just wanting to share the fun personality test and we all learned a lot more than that.John moves on, ""I really appreciate when you qualify a statement with ""here in the United States"" as you so often do. You acknowledge that there is a big world out there and many of us are listening. I'm originally from Ireland."" Which means, I should've been talking more like [Irish accent] this, John, thank you. [Irish accent] [laughs] But you go on to say you've been living in Switzerland for many years, so who knows what's happened to your accent, "" ... a country where the tax rate on share capital gains is a big fat and very lovely ... "" Wow, this sounds good, I didn't know this, John, "" ... zero. Not a bad advertisement [laughs] for the country of Switzerland. Like your podcasts, I hope to finish this note with a flourish. Below I've described my road to Foolishness and some of the core tenets of The Motley Fool in a short poem. I've taken a slight liberty with your surname, which I hope you'll enjoy, a huge thanks to you, Tom, and the 400-odd fools making The Motley Fool the model company it is today. Fool on! John Flood.""Well, John, I am honored to read your poetry, this is the first poem that you've shared with our podcast, I like it enough that I hope you'll think about more in future. And I do love it when our members and listeners send in poetry. You know, that I've done this over the years, perhaps at some future date we can have a reading of all the poems ever shared through this podcast. And if we do that, we'll certainly reread this one.Becoming a Fool by John Flood.""It always begins with an inhibiting doubt, I could never invest with success or with clout.The market is only for pros, in the know, not for me, a mere ordinary Joe.Leave it to the experts, hand over your cash, they talk with conviction they cut a fine dash.At Christmas, they send you a card, a small gift as your investments lag the market in a downward drift.This cannot go on, this financial scam, it's time to wake up, tell those posers to scream.But who to turn to, who can I trust, what was presented as gold turned out to be rust?The solution is to buy individual shares, led by a company who, both, guides and cares. Their three stated aims, to make you smarter, happier and richer, complete their charter.Take centerstage ... "" This is very kind, John.""Take centerstage, The Motley Fool, two brothers indifferent to the current cool.In for the long haul, not today or tomorrow, using money you neither need nor borrow.Gardner by name, and boy! can they sow the seeds to sustainable portfolio wealth,finding companies disrupting the status quo.No magic formula, no slithery stealth.Winners win, seems an obvious fact,But here's the Rule Breaking contrarian act, you buy, you love the spectacular rise,Yet in order to win the ultimate prize, you must buy and buy and buy some more, the sell refrain you resolutely ignore.The market falls fast, makes the legs feel weak, don't sell in a hurry, be steadfast, not meek.Doing nothing seems reckless while panic holds sway, the market will recover and sellers cry in dismay.The index curve from left-to-right over a 100 years and upward slope, where are those drops, those times of fright, only visible under a microscope.If you're still unsure watching from the side, take that first step, you'll soon find your stride at Fool.com.Help and guidance await, it's time you took control of your financial fate.""That was Becoming a Fool by John Flood. And boy! John, have you. Thank you.Rule Breaker mailbag item No. 2. This one comes from House Hunter. Now, there's a chance that your last name is Hunter in real life and you might have been named House. I mean, maybe your family thought it would be funny and get you into real estate ahead of time or maybe it's a pun or maybe it's just an anonymous name. But, House Hunter, thank you for this note.""One of the rules is not to double down, but add up to winners."" Now, I should specify what House Hunter means there. House Hunter is referring to trait No. 2 of the Rule Breaker investor. The right tactics to success for Rule Breaker Investing trait No. 2, of course, add up, don't double down. So, from that, House Hunter goes on to say, ""Say, a new recommendation comes out and I don't have funds to buy until a later time. In the meantime, say, the stock price goes down significantly, would you recommend initiating a position, which I assume is, yes, because it's an active recommendation."" And the answer right now is, yes, yes, I would, assuming it remains an active recommendation, which they usually do on our sites and in Stock Advisor and Rule Breakers. Yes, I would. But I like the subtlety and nuance that you now introduce.House Hunter says, ""I'm a little conflicted because, say, someone else bought when the recommendation was made, and now they are down in the stock, but say, the person wanted to buy more at the lower price, the rule of not doubling down on stocks which have dropped in price is not recommended, but if it's OK to initiate a position at the lower price, kind of, for that person, would it not conflict with the doubling down rule? So, does your advice change or matter whether the stock went down to company-specific reasons versus the entire market dropping and dragging everyone down. Rule Breakers and the entire team is awesome, I listen to all the other podcasts with Industry Focus being timely on a daily basis. Fool on! From House Hunter.""I want to mention, by the way, I just discovered myself, it's been happening for a few weeks, but there's now a sixth Motley Fool podcast, it comes from our Millionacres team: Matt Argersinger, Matt Frankel, and others. And I highly recommend, if you have interest in real estate, if you think you might one day be interested in real estate, I bet you'll enjoy downloading and subscribing to our Millionacres podcast.Well, House Hunter, I just want to say two brief points. The first one is that it is true that you and that hypothetical person might be acting differently based on the same stock if you follow my advice, because on the one hand you decided not to buy, it went down, it's still an active recommendation for us. And so, I'm saying, yes, I think you could buy some shares there. And yet, there's this other person who did buy when you were hoping to, but couldn't, this person did buy, the stock dropped for them, and my advice to that person is, don't add more to that position, and yet, it's the same stock at the same price for you both.While that may seem like a contradiction, for me, anyway, it isn't, because the advice is meant to be followed individually. In other words, for you, House Hunter, you haven't bought that stock yet, it sounds like you'd like to buy that stock, and the stock is down. Good news, if you buy, you will be getting a better price than we record on our scorecard and report back through our performance. So, you'll be getting, if the stock ends up a winner, you'll be getting a better outcome than we do on our scorecard or members who are following us earlier than you did. And yet, for the other person who already owns some, I'm saying, with extra money, most of the time tend to add, not to a position down for you, but a position that is up for you. Now, none of these are hard-and-fast rules, they are principles, they are pirates' code, really just guidelines after all. But I think it's helpful for us, as investors, to add to our winners. So, in your case, you hadn't bought it yet, so it's not a winner or a loser for you, you're entering that position. For that other person, they are down.Now, I won't say I've never added to a stock that's down; occasionally, in our services and on our scorecards, you'll see I did add to Netflix once when it was down, and I did add to Activision Blizzard once when it was down. And the reason I'm thinking of those two, is because they've been spectacular, so it did work for me.My second, and concluding point is, when do we ever add to our losers? Well, most of the time, you know, I don't. That's just what I do; it's what I recommend. Your mileage may vary. But the times that I have are when I'm looking at the balance sheet of the company, and while the stock might be down, that's why I'm looking at it discussing this right now, I'm looking at a balance sheet with a lot of cash, little to no debt, often management in place and doing something that I think is special in this world, whether it's leading the charge to streaming content on the internet, as Netflix did, or leading the charge, a movement from entertainment away from movies toward video games, which Activision Blizzard has been rocking for +20 years. Yeah, those are leaders that I like, and I have occasionally added to stocks that are down, but it is rare.So, I hope you hear me speaking out both sides of my mouth in a way that makes sense to you, when somebody else might hear a different thing for them, and yet I hope it works for you both.All right. Rule Breaker mailbag item No. 3. Now, I'm not going to reflect deeply about these, but there are two notes along the same theme. I think the theme will become clear; I love this theme. I want to say something briefly at the end to make sure no one thinks I'm utterly crazy, but let's go ahead and share.First, we'll go with Pat Fizzano. So, Pat, thank you for this. ""Hey, David, I'm a member of Rule Breakers, I've been listening to the podcast for about a year now. I'm 22. I wanted to get started with investing. However, I've noticed that even after doing my homework and finding great companies to invest in, I didn't have the funds to invest in them all. And so, I struggled with choosing, and then, eventually, I just didn't buy any. And this continued to happen for months until this week. After I listened to your podcast last week where you talked about using dice to make decisions, I decided to give it a try. I'm an avid Dungeons & Dragons player, so the thought of using dice excited me.""""So, I made a list of the companies I did my research on and liked. And then I broke out my favorite D10 ... "" that would be a 10-sided polyhedral die; a decahedron, I believe "" ... and I rolled it ... "" says Pat "" ... four times to pick four companies to invest in. And after that I rolled again just to see how many shares to buy, you know, just for fun. I then immediately bought shares in each of the four companies, three of which were Motley Fool suggestions. I just want to thank you for sharing this helpful tip that is making my life happier and richer Fool on! Pat Fi.""And a related note, this one from Reed McCullough. ""David, I wanted to comment on your most recent podcast of Rule Breaker Investing. As a teenager, in the '90s, I was introduced to the game HeroQuest, which was a gateway into all sorts of games that use dice in unique ways."" And, yes, by the way, Pat and Reed, I both know, and have played, Dungeons & Dragons and HeroQuest; great times. Reed goes on. ""Now in my 40s, I'm once again questing for adventures and creating my own games, having rediscovered my love of the D10. Your comments regarding randomization made me smile, as we all hope to crit with the D20, 20-bagger perhaps."" We'll just not explain those and some of you will get those references, well played. ""But what I appreciate most is your calming, easy listening voice as you cover an assortment of topics that I would not normally consider. And the fact that I no longer look at investing as a random chance, but with a bevy of podcasts made available from The Motley Fool, I'm able to approach the market and life in a more informed manner. So, thank you. PS: There is no app that can replace the feel of rolling dice."" End of note.Well Pat and Reed and all my fellow Fools, a lot of you are gamers, and so, if you're like me, you just love those notes. You want to share those notes on your weekly podcast mailbag. How could you not share the story of the guy who is rolling dice to see which stocks he should buy? Now, I realize, looked at one way, that sounds deeply, crazily irresponsible. And I certainly want everybody to hear 100% from me, I do not think that you should randomly pick stocks and randomly roll numbers of shares to buy, that is not what I do, that is actually not what any of my correspondents do. What Pat, my first correspondent did, is he had his list of his favorite stocks and he could not -- he was paralyzed, he could not buy any of them. And so, he did what I explained in Mental Tips, Tricks, And Lifehacks that I learned to do in college when selecting a restaurant to go out to supper with friends, I would randomize simply to get us off our duffs and get us to take action. And I described in that episode, how that's a tactic I've used ever since. My favorite way to go down my to-do list on a daily basis is not from No. 1 down to No. 27 or whatever it is. It's actually to randomize 27 numbers and see which one I'm going to do next.And while you might think, well, why don't you prioritize them and do the most important thing first, which I think is a great approach to life. I have a lot more fun not doing that. And on my to-do list of 27 items, there are some horrendous things that I do not want to do and would push them as far down the list as I could normally. But the die, when it comes up with that number forces me, I have the sacred pact, it forces me to do that thing then. So, I've done a lot of things and been more productive as a consequence of randomization than had I not.I also understand that Tolstoy, yep, Leonid Tolstoy used to dice his life decisions. Well, I think that sounds kind of crazy, portions of my own life have indeed, as I just shared, [laughs] been determined. So, Pat, I know, you know that I don't think anybody should just be dicing what to do in life, including which stocks to buy. But if you have a curated list of goodness and you can't figure out what to do next or what to do first, a D10 isn't a bad idea. And Reed McCullough loved your note as well. Thank you. And you're right, there is no app that can replace the feel of rolling dice.All right. Rule Breaker mailbag item No. 4. This one is from Ubiratan Sousa, and Ubi, you write, ""Hi David, my wife and I are from Latin America. She is from Mexico and I am from Brazil. We've been in the U.S. for 10 years but never lost touch with our family, friends and cultural environment. The motivation to write to you came not from one of your recent podcasts, but from local stories that I wanted to share with the Fool community.""""The first has to do with MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI), the company's logo is a shake of hands, symbolizing the gesture that follows a transaction or a deal."" For those not familiar with it, simply search for ""MercadoLibre"" at Fool.com and you will see it. And if you go to Mercado Libre's Mexican or Brazilian websites, MercadoLibre.Com.MX or .BR., you will notice that they changed their logo and replaced the handshake with an elbow bump. ""In Latin America there is a lot of controversy about how serious COVID-19 is and the measures that should be in place to reduce its spread, the country's government officials feed a great deal of this controversy. And I find it brave that a company like MercadoLibre made this change and brought it to the forefront of their brand. The importance of fighting this virus and of following the recommended health and safety guidelines. Mainly, because in Latin America governments can make life difficult for companies that do not follow the official agenda. You've given many reasons to invest in this company in this podcast, I thought you might like to learn about another great one.""""The second also has something to do with MercadoLibre. It recently surpassed Vale, the Brazilian mining conglomerate, as the largest company in Latin America. Most of the local market pundits have noticed it and were quick to attribute it to a bubble forming again in the U.S. stock market, reminding people of the dot-com debacle of the early '00s and that they should run away from the Nasdaq. Sadly, I couldn't find one single note talking about the merits of MercadoLibre and how important this company is for the region's economy, particularly in these times of COVID-19, treating it like a fad is a disservice to the investor community and the public, in general.""""And that brings me to my request to you, we're living in times of record low interest in Latin America, particularly, in Brazil. When I lived there it was easy to make 10% to 15% a year above inflation by buying government bonds. When I moved to the U.S. I realized that I would have to learn about the stock market to have similar gains. I don't know if The Motley Fool has ever considered having a branch in Latin America, but if you haven't now is the time, Brazilians, Mexicans, Chilean, Argentinians will need to learn how to invest in the stock market to see their wealth grow, and I haven't seen anybody that can provide the kind of quality education and investment recommendations that you do. I hope my family and friends will have the opportunity to become subscribers of the Fool sooner than later. Please come to their rescue. Thanks, gracias, obrigado, and Fool on! Ubi.""Well, of course, I love this note and it was my honor to share it as Rule Breaker mailbag item No. 4. Several things jump out to me. First of all, I didn't know that story about MercadoLibre. I do follow the company, but I didn't know that it had changed its logo. And that it did so, says a lot to me. And as you point out, companies like this that rattle their sabers or make too much noise, sometimes can get the attention of governments that may or may not like their actions. So, it does take a little bit of extra courage, I think, to do what Mercado Libre has done. And at the same time, I'm so confident in its leadership. I can't speak to the leadership of individual countries in Latin America, there's a wide range of different leaders, but I can say one thing, some of my favorite leaders come from business. And part of their leadership is conscious leadership, as we learned from John Mackey in the past month, when we did an extra on his book Conscious Leadership; that was at the end of September.So, some of the best examples for me, in my lifetime, have come from the leadership of public companies. And often they're the founders, they're the leaders who can take extra risk, and whose personal reputation is tied up in the brands of their companies. So, I see this as another example, MercadoLibre. Thank you for telling that story, Ubi.And then, certainly, I think that MercadoLibre has earned its market cap, and if I were a betting man, and darn it! I am, I'm an investor, I'm playing the long-game. And thinking about the next 10 years, I would predict that MercadoLibre will have a substantially higher market cap than Vale. Which isn't to say much about Vale, it's just to convey my optimism and belief in MercadoLibre. Now, that optimism and belief isn't pie in the sky or happy go lucky. It's been earned by holding the stock for more than 11 years now. Our cost was $14.13, as we brought it to Rule Breakers in February 2009, just over $14/share, today it's over $1,200/share. We have been wildly right, and indeed this 90-bagger has been the single best performer in Motley Fool Rule Breakers' history. I'm absolutely delighted it came from Latin America. There are great companies around the world, most of the time you're just looking for the businesses that are doing well by doing good. And I think MercadoLibre is a great example.And as for whether there will be Motley Fool services in Latin America, I can't say what my talented CEO brother, Tom Gardner, will decide next, as Fool international expands, but I'll say this, many of our listeners are members, and many of you, there is an opportunity for anybody anywhere in the world to subscribe to Motley Fool Stock Advisor, Motley Fool Rule Breakers, any of our services. So, I hope that you will not wait for The Motley Fool to show up locally in a country when we're already available with great stocks like MercadoLibre, for those who may still not trust it in Latin America.Anyway, Ubi, thank you for the note and Fool on!All right. Rule Breaker mailbag item No. 5. This comes from John Grant. ""Hi, David. Longtime listener, first-time writer. I discovered Motley Fool over 20 years ago, when I used to read a newspaper, [laughs] and you wrote a syndicated weekly column. Rich wisdom and great fun over the years. You've helped me make wonderful investments. I enjoyed your bonus interview with John Mackey on Conscious Leadership. I have listened twice and benefited both times."" Well, thank you for that, John.""Two years ago, I walked away from my stable job to work with a nonprofit Homeless Ministry. It has been a delightful adventure. What you said on the podcast is true, there is a stereotype that leaders in the nonprofit world are purpose-driven and lead with love, and that is nothing more than a stereotype. I have been surprised how few nonprofits operate with principles like the ones Mackey and his co-writers encourage. Just like in the business world, nonprofit leaders struggle to focus their energy and work for win-win-win. Most nonprofits stay small and few outlive their founder.""""Jim Collins wrote a bonus edition of his book Good to Great that applies to the social sector. It explains how nonprofits lack a key indicator that businesses enjoy; that would be profits. If a business undertakes a losing initiative, they pull the plug once the losses accumulate. A nonprofit is not trying to generate income, so it can stick with a lousy idea sometimes as long as the donors keep paying. Nonprofits lose the feedback loop provided by the market. All that to say, don't let the stereotypes fool you, nonprofits might have to work harder than businesses to enact principles like the ones Mackey shared. Thanks again, and Fool on!""Well a provocative thought, John, and in your case, borne by your own personal experience. Congratulations on the Ministry work that you are doing, it sounds like it's succeeding, and I hope it outlives its founder. And you're right, there are lots of stereotypes about for-profit and not-for-profit. Here's another one I heard recently. This was from a dad of a middle school child who was ruing what had happened that week at their middle school. The kids were all invited to come up with an idea for a new enterprise. And let's just put him in about seventh grade. And let's say there were about 14 kids in that class and they all did, they came back with their presentations at the next class. And to a boy and girl, all 14 of them had dreamed up a not-for-profit. Nobody, none of the middle school kids, had a for-profit plan or idea. I'm certainly not sitting here in judgment of that, I think any new enterprise that adds value to the world is a beautiful thing, but for things to be so skewed to where, at least in that one classroom, you tell me fellow Fools whether this is indicative of this younger generation or not, I don't have a developed viewpoint, but in that school, anyway, not a single kid came up with a for-profit business idea.I think about the power of profits and how they allow us to reinvest and grow our enterprises and how they are, as John mentions, a feedback loop that helps us understand when things aren't working and when we should actually shelve something. It's a very powerful thing. So, I guess, I would say in reflection and conclusion, I wish seven of those kids had come up with a for-profit business idea, and seven had come up with a not-for-profit, but the idea that, I don't know, what was going through the kids' or parents' minds, does a for-profit make you look greedy, I sure hope not.I am so grateful for the products and services that I buy and use every single day from for-profit enterprises that surround me and greatly enrich my life. And certainly, the one that my brother Tom is a CEO, and we're Co-Chairman of, and have been managing for 27 years. I am so grateful, profoundly so, that we can do it and have done it and are doing it for-profit, in a way that allows us to expand already well past my wildest dreams when I came up with the name The Motley Fool out [laughs] of The Penguin Book of Quotations [The Penguin Dictionary of Quotations] (sic) and said, ""Hey, Tom, should we name the newsletter ""The Motley Fool?"" 27 years ago.Rule Breaker mailbag item No. 6. ""On October 14th, the lifehacks podcast was a terrific listen,"" says Noel in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. ""Two comments, ... "" thank you for these, Noel. ""First, Frank's faceoff advice is solid, let me add to it. When you realize you are facing off with a guy you can't beat, be humble enough to recognize it, ignore the puck entirely and just tie up his stick. This gives your team the chance to come in and get the puck. There are tons of life metaphors you could take from this. And No. 2 ... "" Noel says, "" ... I love words and rarely come across a new one. I'd never heard the word ""agglomerated"" before [laughs] and had to look it up. Thanks for the teaching. If I ever find a way to work it into a conversation, if anybody notices, I will give you the credit."" Signed, again, ""Noel in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada."" Thank you for the amusement, Noel, one Fool to another.Rule Breaker mailbag item No. 7. ""Hey, David, hope all is well. I have a nomination for your next Great Quotes podcast, it might sound familiar, ""Given the proliferation of information and speed of information today, where does our edge as investors come from? Wisdom, perspective, mindset. There are a lot of aspects of human character and human psychology for which we can be examples, where we can exhibit excellence. And separate ourselves from the vast majority of others who are also just trading the market, also the machines that are just trying to read algorithmic numbers."" This is one of your quotes, ... "" says Erin Barrow, "" ... from the Circle of Competence podcast. This statement stood out to me as I listened to you speak with Benton Moss.""He's referring to an appearance I made. My friend Benton Moss, his podcast Circle of Competence. He had me on a couple of months ago, I really enjoyed that conversation, if anybody wants to hear me get interviewed by somebody else, I think you'll really enjoy the time I spent with Benton, clearly you did, Erin, and thank you very much for honoring me with that quote.I don't think it's a great enough quote to make my great quotes podcast. I really, obviously, am flattered by the inclusion, but I hope that this sentiment does come through. And indeed, it seems like it did to you, Erin. You went on to say, ""I've experienced the truth of what you said, I was not an economics finance or business major. Almost all of my investing education has come from The Motley Fool podcasts and website. I will almost certainly never have the same level of knowledge or experience that so-called financial professionals have obtained, and that's OK. I know that I can still succeed as an investor, I can have the wisdom to invest in good companies, not chase the latest fads. I can have the perspective to think long-term, not worry about short-term fluctuations of the market. And I can have the mindset of adding to my winners and watching them grow rather than cashing in after a predetermined game. Thanks for all that you do to be an exemplar and exhibit investing excellence for us. Fool on! Erin."" Erin, thank you, Fool on! to you back, Sir.And I can really relate to that note, because I think, as I've often said in the past, Tom and I were both English majors, yep, we never went on to get graduate degrees, we certainly didn't get MBAs, we didn't get any kind of investment certificate certifying us as investors, we're just fellow travelers along the path of life, sharing it back and trying to grow a company, making you smarter, [laughs] happier, and richer. We have learned so much over the course of time. And a lot of my job, and I do it here every week with you in this podcast, it's just trying to share it back, share it out. I've learned so much from all of you that part of my role is simply to share that back out.All right. That takes us to the last one. Rule Breaker mailbag item No. 8. Now, there is a letter that accompanies this that I'm not going to read, but it's from Michael. Michael writes from Calgary, Alberta, Canada, another great Canadian Fool. Michael is the one I referenced a few podcasts ago when I mentioned that some things are just too long to read on a Rule Breaker mailbag. After all, when I'm struggling to come in under 50, if you write me a four-page letter, I'm probably not going to be able to share that. Michael heard me that day, he took it to heart and he rewrote it all in a page-and-a-half, actually less than a page-and-a-half. So, Michael, good on you, because I loved your four-page note, I just couldn't share it in the first place.Then you wrote me an explanatory cover letter about that experience, what you learned, and then you finished it with your actual letter that will close this Rule Breaker Investing mailbag.""Hello, David. I wanted to quickly share the impact of The Motley Fool on my life, a second time."" With a smiley and a wink. ""I joined Stock Advisor Canada on August 27th, 2019, followed by Stock Advisor in the U.S. in April of 2020. Since then The Motley Fool has helped me create my own path to financial freedom, but what about prior to The Motley Fool? Well, I was always good at saving money, but I was fearful of the stock market, so I was left to returns that banks offered. I thought there had to be a better way.""""I went to a financial advisor. One of my investments was found to have fraudulent activity, now down about 90%. The funds I invested in are not liquid, and so I'm stuck until maturity with poor performance. I was no longer confident in trusting my money to a financial advisor. I then began buying stocks in the marijuana industry due to what I have now learned is FOMO. [Fear Of Missing Out] I held my stocks, only to watch their value plummet."" Yep, there are a lot of bad cannabis companies out there, and we hope a few good ones.""After joining The Motley Fool and using several of its resources and teachings, I learned I had not invested in good companies. I sold those at a loss, as I learned my thesis was broken, and reinvested into Motley Fool recs right away. My biggest learning, I wasn't diversified enough in any of my original investments, and put too much money into those same investments, I even doubled down in some cases. After all this, one would think I would never invest again, but I would not quit. I was not going to give up, I felt I could figure this out as The Motley Fool continued to inspire me to press on and learn. I now realize managing my own portfolio allows me flexibility, and I get to make the final decision on where I put my money, there is empowerment in that, and The Motley Fool taught me this.""""Well, last August 14th, 2019, I lost my wonderful mother. Neither of my parents were stock investors, but they helped me understand managing personal finances, and they made it clear you had to save for retirement. So many great lessons and guidance from them both. Shortly after losing my mom, I discovered The Motley Fool, and maybe it was a last bit of financial guidance from my parents, one last lesson, if you believe in that sort of thing. Stock Advisor Canada got me on the correct path, thanks to Rob in the membership services.""""Rob told me about the podcasts, and this was the biggest gamechanger for me as an investor. This led me to Stock Advisor USA, to Motley Fool Live TV and so much more knowledge. The lessons around emotions and temperament with investing, while understanding the history of the market and how often big drops occur and to expect them have been priceless. It might be the most important lesson of all. When the market crashed this year, I didn't panic, The Motley Fool taught me not to. Remember the Rule Breaker Investing podcast in early 2020 with the mock market crash?"" Well, I sure do, Michael. ""What a great lesson for a new investor. I kept investing at regular intervals, and when the crash came, not only did I hold my stocks, I deployed cash above and beyond my regular schedule and bought or added to great companies. I didn't wait on the sidelines for a W recovery to occur, I kept investing.""""The Motley Fool also teaches you must know the score. So, thanks to Brian Withers and his tracking spreadsheet, I can tell you my portfolio was up about 47% since Aug. 27, 2019, beating the S&P by 29 percentage points. As we learn on Rule Breaker Investing, keep adding to your winners. I bought into this early thanks to the podcasts and Fool TV and I just added to my winners. This knowledge has not only changed my financial path, but I love it more than sports. Thank you, David, and thanks to the entire Motley Fool team. Keep up the great work on both sides of the border. You've made me smarter, happier, and richer in so many ways, some of which are not tangible. Fool on!""Well, Fool on! to you, Michael H. writing in from Calgary, Alberta, Canada; writing in twice.And thus, ends October for Rule Breaker Investing, I am looking forward to November election and all, I'll be holding on tight to all of these great companies we talk about every week on this podcast. And speaking of great companies we talk about every week, every week of November we'll be reviewing one past 5-Stock Sampler. Yup, that will be a back theme to the primary theme of each of the podcasts, one of which will be a new 5-Stock Sampler.

23,"Nov 4, 2020 1:49PM EST","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhat can Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) teach us about momentum investing? Since its 2010 initial public offering (IPO), the electric car company has rocketed to ever-growing heights. $10,000 invested in the company would have grown into $1.28 million today.But these eye-popping returns usually elicit feelings of “could-have-but-didn’t.” In other words, how many people do you know who became multi-millionaires by investing in TSLA? Unless you’re friends with the Tesla executive team, the answer is likely “zero.”Why? That’s because momentum investing is one of the most challenging investment styles to master. (And this is coming from an investor who specializes in it.)In my experience, I’ve found that investors usually do one of the following:So, how can investors stop missing out on the next 1,000X stock? Here are five critical lessons that Tesla teaches us about good momentum investing.How do you even begin finding the next Tesla? Today, there are 6,000 companies listed on the NYSE and NASDAQ exchanges. If you include over-the-counter stocks (also known as pink sheets) and international companies, the number balloons to over 41,000. Even professional investors often don’t know where to start.Here’s how to beat the experts: buy the clear winners.Take electric vehicles, for instance. Back in 2009, Tesla had one primary competitor: Fisker Auto. At the time, both companies seemed quite comparable; Tesla got its start from a $465 million low-interest loan from the U.S. Department of Energy, while Fisker received a $529 million one. But, those in the know started to suspect something was wrong at Fisker. While Tesla’s reviews and battery design flaws received some negative press, Fisker got pushed into the deep end.“Where press is concerned, Fisker has garnered more than enough dents over performance issues with the Karma,” Inc writer Jeremy Quittner reported in 2012, “including a car bursting into flames and the vehicle failing to perform for Consumer Reports, to relegate it to the salvage yard.” Fisker would continue struggling and eventually go bankrupt after a massive battery recall by its supplier. Tesla, meanwhile, would rank among the top ten most valuable companies.Now, the “winner-takes-all” rule doesn’t always apply. Successful duopolies can last years (or even indefinitely) – Oracle (NYSE:ORCL)/Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Chevron (NYSE:CVX)/Exxon (NYSE:XOM) and Coke (NYSE:KO)/Pepsi (NYSE:PEP) are all pairs that have performed reasonably well. But when it comes to momentum investing, it’s usually better to buy the more established company. That’s because, if a duopoly fails, you want to hold onto the company that will survive.The past 70 years of data show that stock prices (not earnings growth) are a better predictor of returns. The conclusion might seem counterintuitive at first – earnings should ultimately dictate stock price. But in practice, investors do the opposite.“Price momentum, particularly with large-capitalization stocks, conveys different information about the prospects of a stock and is a much better indicator than factors such as earnings growth rates,” wrote fund manager James O’Shaughnessy in his book What Works on Wall Street. “First, price momentum is the market putting its money where its mouth is. Second, the common belief that stocks with strong relative strength also have the highest price-to-earnings (PE) ratios or earnings growth is incorrect.”Academics might turn their noses. But in the real world, Tesla stock followed this guide to a tee. Operating losses ballooned during Tesla’s highest-growth years between 2013 to 2017 when it scaled up its Model S production. Loss per share went from negative -$0.06 to negative -$2.09. Its market capitalization, however, almost tripled during that period.High potential companies often sacrifice short-term earnings for long-term gain. Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) did that in 2013 as it switched users to its highly lucrative Creative Cloud suite. Amazon saw minimal earnings growth for much of its years. It pays to hold on.There’s a misconception that momentum stocks are also expensive on the four primary valuation ratios:But that’s not always the case. And as Tesla stock teaches us, it’s best to buy high-momentum stocks when they’re cheap. (Conversely, avoid momentum stocks when they’re expensive)Consider Tesla in 2011 when its shares were expensive. That year, its P/S ratio stood at 14.0x, a princely sum for a money-losing startup. Shareholders would have earned 0% gains as valuations caught up. By 2019, Tesla’s P/S ratio had fallen to just 3.0x. The company would return 440% to shareholders the following year.Mr. Shaughnessy found the same conclusion when working with larger samples. Various momentum strategies he used “almost always works best when you include a value factor in the model.”There’s one downside to momentum investing: it’s also one of the most volatile strategies.According to data from the Kenneth French library, pure momentum strategies had an 80% drawdown during the 2009 global financial crisis. And these swings make momentum strategies extremely difficult to stick with, even though they tend to win in the long run. Tesla has seen its share of volatility too. Since 2010, Tesla has seen drawdowns (peak-to-bottom losses) of 35% or more on 12 separate occasions. And in March 2020, the stock dropped 63% from its previous high. Each time it’s fallen, investors should have bought, not sold the stock.So, how can investors tell the difference between a temporary dip and a permanent fall? It depends on the length of the decline. In Tesla’s case, the stock took 18 months or less to recover in all but one instance in 2017.When dips last longer than 18 months, investors should sell, especially when people had ignored Lesson #3: valuation. For instance, in the massive 1999 tech bubble, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares rocketed to a nosebleed 45 times P/S ratio. In the 18 months following its December 1999 peak, AMZN stock cratered 85% to $15. Investors would have been better selling out before the stock dropped another 60%. (They could have re-bought later once momentum indicators had turned positive again).When in doubt about a momentum company, look out the window. Do you see the underlying company doing well? Are Teslas driving up and down your street?Stocks don’t exist in a vacuum. Instead, they tend to track the firm they represent. Put another way, a company that’s doing supremely well tends to have higher-performing stock. (There are always exceptions, particularly in value investing. But it’s rarely the case in growth/momentum investing).Tesla exemplifies this “look-out-the-window” principle. When the Model S launched in 2012, the car was so popular that buyers often had to wait almost a year for delivery. Forum sites popped up with people comparing wait times. It’s marketing that no money could buy.Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) saw a similar demand with their iPhones. Even the eleventh generation of iPhones released in 2019 saw overnight lines out the door. And its stock has gone up accordingly.When buying momentum stocks, it’s often tempting to chase the most popular, most expensive companies. Zoom Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) and Shopify (NASDAQ:SHOP) both have price-to-sales ratios over 30x, for instance.But the data tells us to do otherwise. Instead, we should use the lessons of Tesla stock investors.If you’re looking to dive into momentum investing, be sure you’re buying the top-dog companies on the cheap. For example, Carvana (NYSE:CVNA) trades at just 2.6x P/S (and has a 190% 12-month gain). First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) has a similar valuation and an intriguing turnaround story.These are not always the most comfortable companies to buy. But as Tesla’s formative self shows us: great investing can involve making difficult decisions. And it pays to get things right.On the date of publication, Tom Yeung did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Tom Yeung, CFA, is a registered investment advisor on a mission to bring simplicity to the world of investing.The post 5 Lessons Tesla Teaches Us About Momentum Investing appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-lessons-tesla-teaches-us-about-momentum-investing-2020-11-04

24,"Nov 4, 2020 12:18PM EST","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn recent months, much has been made of electric-vehicle (EV) stocks, and some of them have been on fire. But there’s little doubt that autonomous vehicles (AVs) will be tremendously more profitable than non-autonomous EVs. As a result, I believe that longer-term investors should put much more of their money into autonomous vehicle stocks than EV stocks.With AVs, companies will be able to run taxi and delivery services while cutting out what is by far the biggest cost of any transportation service: human drivers. Consequently, the leaders of the AV sector should have huge profit margins and report very impressive earnings-per-share numbers. By contrast, the runaway leader of the EV sector – Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) – is currently only profitable by virtue of clean-energy credits that it sells to competitors.Professor Mark Levine and Assistant Professor Libbi Levine Segev of the University of Denver’s Daniels College of Business expect widespread usage of AVs. They recently said, “Amazon, busses, delivery companies, farming, and many other enterprises and fields are and will continue to employ [AVs], thus reducing costs and gaining greater efficiency.“Here are three autonomous vehicle stocks that, over the next one to two years, should generate gigantic returns:Since it develops technology for both AVs and EVs, and makes AVs, Aptiv is a great play on both, and will benefit greatly no matter which automaker comes out on top.Additionally, the company has signed multiple partnerships with major companies which validate its AV technology. One is the large South Korean automaker, Hyundai. Together with Hyundai and ride-sharing startup Via, Aptiv intends “to launch a shared robotaxi service for the public in a U.S. city in the first half of 2021,” TechCrunch recently reported.And Aptiv already has a great deal of experience in operating a robotaxi service. As of last February, the auto-parts maker’s AVs, in the framework of a partnership with Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT), had completed “100,000 driverless rides.” Impressively, as of that time, 98% of the passengers had given the service five stars. The service took passengers to “over 3,400 destinations in the Las Vegas area.”Another big positive for APTV stock is the company’s recently reported third-quarter results. Its top and bottom lines, as well as its 2020 guidance, came in well above analysts’ average estimates. Further, Aptiv “generated $559 million of cash from operations in Q3.” Analysts, on average, expect its earnings per share to nearly triple in 2021.APTV stock is trading for 25.5 times the mean 2021 EPS estimate. Considering the company’s leadership position and tremendous potential, that is quite a bargain.Lidar is a key technology used to enable autonomous driving. According to Mizuho, Lidar generated $1.5 billion of revenue last year and that will jump to roughly $3.6 billion within five years.And within the Lidar sector, as I pointed out in a prior column, Velodyne is a large, rapidly growing player. At the beginning of this year, it had three major deals. As of Aug. 1, it had signed 18 major contracts.In 2020, Velodyne – whose Lidar is also used in rapidly proliferating advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) – is expected to generate $100 million of revenue. Its CEO expects its top line to jump to $680 million in four years. Additionally, Velodyne anticipates that it will generate a profit in 2022.Meanwhile, Ford (NYSE:F) took a 7.6% stake in VLDR stock. Chinese internet search giant Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), which is making a big push in autonomous driving, also signed a three-year deal with the LIDAR developer. Those big deals validate Velodyne’s technology.With VLDR stock trading at a market capitalization of just over $2 billion, shares look poised for a big surge as ADAS and then AVs proliferate.GM recently achieved three milestones which indicate that it’s a true leader in the AV race.First, the U.S. automaker’s Super Cruise automatic-driving technology, “in a hands-free test” by Consumer Reports, easily beat all competing systems, including Tesla’s Autopilot.And earlier this month, GM’s Cruise subsidiary said it would start testing AVs without drivers or passengers in San Francisco by Dec. 31. It has received a permit from California for those tests.And lastly, the company announced on Oct. 21 that it would seek a federal waiver to utilize vehicles that do not have any “steering wheels or pedals,” Reuters reported. The statement suggests GM is on track to deploy its AVs, which lack steering wheels and pedals, at the end of next year or the beginning of 2022.Meanwhile, as a bonus, a Wedbush analyst recently made upbeat comments about GM’s EVs. GM stock has jumped in the last few months, partly due to increased optimism about its EVs. I’ve been bullish on the company’s EVs for months.Trading at a forward price-earnings ratio of just 7.5, GM stock is quite cheap.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. Larry has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 13 years.

25,"Nov 4, 2020 11:18AM EST","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsChina’s electric vehicle manufacturer Nio (NASDAQ:NIO) is looking better and better with each passing day. Part of that has to do with the euphoria surrounding the EV sector and its most prominent player Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). But there are genuine concerns regarding overvaluation emerging as well. Nio stock is priced for perfection despite not having a ‘first-mover’ advantage and the lack of name recognition, especially in the U.S.Don’t get me wrong. I find the company very interesting, and it’s finally moving the needle, with revenues and deliveries moving northwards. It also has the unique advantage of being headquartered in China, the world’s biggest EV market by a fair stretch. The company is currently one of the best bets to take away market share from bigger brands like Tesla, and it hasn’t even shipped a car to U.S. shores. Long story short, there are plenty of reasons to be bullish on Nio stock.But with a market cap of $40.74 billion and 30.97 times enterprise value/sales, shares are trading too hot for my liking. I believe the markets already feel that they have another Tesla on their hands. And while there are some comparisons that you can make, Nio is not a like-for-like Chinese version of Tesla. That’s why I would wait for the stock to lose a bit more steam before buying in.The company’s future success will have a lot to do with the kind of support it gets from the Chinese administration. If history is anything to go by, then you can expect the Xi Jinping administration to back Nio as the EV sector continues to grow by leaps and bounds in the largest country of the world.This year, the company has secured a $1 billion loan from several state-owned companies in Hefei, the capital and largest city of Anhui Province. In exchange, Nio agreed to establish its company headquarters in the city. It will also give up a stake in one of its business units to the state entities. Meantime, state-owned automobile manufacturer JAC Motors is the company’s contract manufacturer.That should give you some idea of how well-entrenched the partnership is between the Chinese state administration and the company. Couple this with Chinese preferences for local brands, and you can understand why investors value Nio stock so highly.One final bit of information here is that the Chinese government wants to ensure NEVs represent one-fifth of new auto sales by 2025. As of 2019, electric vehicles accounted for almost 5% of the Chinese vehicle market. The pandemic has only exacerbated demand for electric vehicles, and I believe that Nio will ride this demand to the bank. In October, the company delivered 5,055 vehicles, representing 100.1% year-over-year growth. For the year, deliveries are now 31,430 vehicles in total, an uptick of 111.4% year-over-year.Now let’s talk about the elephant in the room, valuation. The Chinese EV maker is trading at higher multiples than the industry leader. Momentum trading and high expectations are powering the stock to valuations that seem astronomical at this stage. The consensus 12-month-ahead target price for Nio stock stands at $138 per share, a 38.2% discount to the current share price. If we compare the company to Tesla, one has to appreciate how far the company has come in seven short years. Elon Musk’s brainchild produced just over 145,000 vehicles in the third quarter and delivered nearly 140,000 vehicles. And that doesn’t take into account the larger issue of Musk’s broad appeal and his brand equity in selling the issue, and how that helps sell Tesla cars. At this point, whether it’s his appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience or his colorful exchanges with journalists on an earnings call, Musk has perfected the image of the eccentric billionaire. Whether you like it or not, that provides publicity to Tesla.That kind of notoriety doesn’t exist for Nio. Plus, Chinese companies don’t exactly have the best reputation in this country. You can blame that on the weak regulatory environment prevalent in China. But that is not down to the company, and you can’t really blame it on Nio. However, it’s not something that you can ignore, particularly if you were stung by Luckin Coffee (OTCMKTS:LKNCY) recently.Nio has exciting growth metrics, and deliveries are growing at an excellent clip. If you are a long term investor in Nio stock, now is the time for your just rewards. But at current multiples, the stock is certainly overvalued. And it’s certainly not alone. Even Tesla, which is the clear industry leader, requires some essential bubble bursting. Valuing Nio almost identically to Tesla is unfair, considering that there is no comparison between the two companies in terms of deliveries, global sales, and net income.That’s why I would wait for some correction before buying into this one.On the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. Faizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

26,"Nov 4, 2020 11:05AM EST","Whichever candidate emerges as the winner of the 2020 presidential election, there are a couple of things that are for certain. First, the country will remain bitterly divided, with neither side of the political spectrum understanding how the other side can think and act as they do. Second, whoever does sit in the White House at the end of January, they will face some economic problems along with the political and societal ones that stem from that lack of understanding and empathy.There are, however, companies that can rise above the politics, and even the economics, and thrive whoever wins and despite the economy.The biggest economic issue that the president will face is not really an economic issue at all. Covid-19 is resurgent, and it seems the economic symptoms of the pandemic, like the clinical symptoms, could turn out to be more persistent in many cases than we first thought. There has been a rapid bounce back of sorts in some parts of the economy, but those who lost their jobs in the hospitality, entertainment and travel industries don’t look like they will be getting them back soon. As a result, unemployment is lower than it was, bit still elevated. The economy has bounced back some from a record shrinking, but is still smaller than it was at the end of last year. The federal government is well over $27 trillion in debt and state and local governments are busting budgets all over the country.What is different now from versus March is that we now know which companies can survive and thrive in those conditions and which cannot. Some of the success stories are a bit surprising. Who would have thought, for example, that retailers like Gap (GPS) and Best Buy (BBY) would be beneficiaries as the economy shut down? Some were a bit more predictable, such as Zoom Communications (ZM) and other tech stocks that saw demand for their products and services inflated by the shift to stay at home working and online learning.Going forward, though, what investors should be asking themselves is how sustainable some of those things are. When things return to something like normal, and they will at some point, will people still be buying appliances at such a massive clip? Will they continue to work from home or return to the office? Will they continue to buy things and shun experiences?There will almost certainly be an adjustment back at some point, so I would rather look at companies that have done well despite, not because of the pandemic and the global reaction to it.Apple (AAPL), for example, did better last quarter than analysts expected, reporting EPS of $0.73 versus the consensus forecast for $0.69. As the holiday season approaches, massive sales of the new iPhone, updated iPads and other recently announced products would fit historical precedent and come as no surprise, but that stock is still well off its highs:Another company that seems to have taken all this in their stride and just kept on making money, and that also has reason to believe that another boost to the stock is coming, is Caterpillar (CAT). They too have been outperforming expectations, beating Q2 estimates by nearly sixty percent and reporting another beat in Q3.Even that relatively strong outperformance could pale soon, though. Whoever gets elected, they will be looking to boost the economy in any way they can, and infrastructure spending will be touted as an answer, as it always is. Yes, I know it has always been infrastructure week for the last four years, and I know that Democrats would traditionally rather hand out money than pay it to big corporations, but we aren’t talking about reality here.We are taking about perception. Talk of multi-billion-dollar infrastructure projects will be enough to boost CAT for a while, whether they materialize or not. Maybe that is why fellow industrial companies such as Jacobs Engineering (J) and Rockwell Automation (ROK) are among the best performing stocks following each of the last 6 elections. Given the current circumstances, however, Caterpillar’s exposure to China may be an advantage post-election as whoever wins seeks to normalize trade relations. Trade wars are fine during booms, but not during a recession. That makes CAT a favorite in the industrial sector.There are other examples too. If you are more adventurous, you might want to consider Tesla (TSLA), which has continued to grow rapidly, virus or no virus. Or maybe more traditional manufacturers like Ford (F), which showed a rapid return to profitability last quarter. Whatever you choose, the most important thing is to look for companies that have continued to do what they do and make money throughout these trying times. They will most likely continue to do so regardless of who hears “Hail to the Chief” every time they enter a room for the next four years.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/election-2020%3A-looking-for-stocks-that-can-be-winners-whoever-wins-2020-11-04

27,"Nov 4, 2020 10:01AM EST","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn the world of special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), the timeline from start-up to a stock listing tends to be accelerated. A prime example would be electric-truck company Lordstown Motors (NASDAQ:RIDE). Lordstown’s shares are now publicly traded under RIDE stock. Lordstown first announced that it would go public through a SPAC in August. This news electrified (pardon the pun) electric-vehicle stock traders, particularly the ones who wanted to take an early position in the next Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) or the next Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA).The plan was to implement a reverse merger with a shell company called DiamondPeak, which I previously reported on and which used to trade under the ticker symbol DPHC.Today investors don’t have to position themselves with Lordstown indirectly through DPHC stock. Instead, they can just buy RIDE stock. That makes life a little bit less complicated, but are the shares worth owning? The stock is a speculative bet, but the potential for disruption and profitability is there.RIDE stock first opened for trading on Oct. 26 at around $20 per share. Unfortunately, the shares are now trading slightly below $18.That’s not what most folks would call an auspicious start. The shares lost nearly 11.5% of their value just on Oct. 30. It might be too early to say that Lordstown has entered a bear market, but its trend is clearly downward.At least we can say that the stock’s volume is fairly strong. During its first few sessions on the Nasdaq exchange, the daily trading volume for RIDE stock was consistently in the millions.Not that the strong trading volume will provide much consolation for the owners of RIDE stock who’ve lost money. All of this begs the question of whether Lordstown Motors is worth investing in at all. Hopefully, we can find some reasons for concerned shareholders to hold the stock.Lordstown Motors first unveiled the prototype of its fully electric pickup truck, known as the Endurance, in June. That’s all fine and good, but investors undoubtedly want to know when the company’s Lordstown, Ohio-based production plant will finally start rolling out vehicles.Moreover, investors will want to know whether the company  has enough cash to meet its production milestones for the Endurance.Thankfully, there are answers to these questions, courtesy of Lordstown Motors founder and CEO Steve Burns. He recently disclosed that Lordstown has “a near production-ready plant and approximately $675 million in proceeds from this transaction, which is more than enough funding to get us through initial production.”Furthermore, the automaker claims to be on track to start commercial production in the  second half of 2021. Bear in mind that things don’t always work out as planned in the world of start-ups. Still, at least Lordstown’s timeline has been established, so that’s good news.Right on the company’s home page, Lordstown Motors proudly boasts that it’s developing “The World’s First All Electric Commercial Pickup.” That’s an ambitious objective for a fairly recent start-up.This magnitude of disruption is possible, though, as Lordstown’s got a powerful backer in the form of automotive giant General Motors (NYSE:GM).For one thing, Lordstown’s operations are housed in a former General Motors assembly plant. Also, General Motors committed to invest $75 million in the Lordstown SPAC merger. Other major investors included BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Fidelity and Wellington.At the very least, it can be said that Lordstown secured a terrific manufacturing plant from General Motors. Amazingly, this 6.2 million-square-foot facility is capable of producing 600,000 electric vehicles each year.And as of Oct. 23, it appeared that General Motors was still strongly rooting for Lordstown’s success. “GM is excited about the progress Lordstown Motors is making because we believe they will help create more good-paying jobs in Ohio and especially in the Lordstown community,” General Motors commented.Investors should be excited as Lordstown moves steadily closer to production. Plus, it certainly doesn’t hurt to have General Motors as a backer.None of this guarantees that RIDE stock will recover. Still, the share-price dip could create a buying opportunity. Lordstown is in the early innings, and 2021 could be a grand-slam year for its shareholders.On the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.The post Don’t Let the Post-Debut Dip Shake You Out of Lordstown Motors appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dont-let-the-post-debut-dip-shake-you-out-of-lordstown-motors-2020-11-04

28,"Nov 4, 2020 9:05AM EST","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsChasing growth is the goal of most investors. And there are many different types of strategies that can be employed to get large gains when it comes to growth stocks.However, big rewards often come with big risks. In this article, we look at four growth investing strategies that can be used with the growth stocks listed on the Robinhood trading platform’s Top 100 most popular stocks list.Applying these trading strategies to popular stocks on Robinhood could yield sizable returns for beginner and experienced investors.Emerging markets tend to be a high risk, high reward area to invest in. Investing in companies based in South America, Eastern Europe, Pakistan, India and China can offer growth potential for aggressive investors who have an appetite for risk.China, in particular, has a number of companies that have been providing big returns to investors over the past few years. One of them that is high up on Robinhood’s Top 100 list is Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), the e-commerce giant that is often referred to as the “Amazon of China.” Since March, BABA stock has risen 75% to just under $310 a share.Some analysts see this stock rising more than 600% in the next 12 months. That’s huge! But investors need to be aware of the risks when it comes to emerging markets.Governments are often not as stable in emerging market countries and regulatory oversight can be lacking. Fraud, corruption and misinformation can run wild. In countries such as China, just as many publicly traded companies implode as succeed.Case in point: Luckin Coffee (OTCMKTS:LKNCY). Billed as the “Starbucks of China,” Luckin Coffee earlier this year was trading on the New York Stock Exchange for more than $50 a share. But after an accounting scandal was revealed at the company, the stock was delisted in the U.S. and now trades “over the counter” for under $5 a share, a drop of 90% in a few months.There are several exchange traded funds (ETFs) that can be used to invest in emerging markets, such as the Global X MSCI Pakistan ETF (NYSEARCA:PAK) and the iShares MSCI Poland ETF (NYSEARCA:EPOL). These emerging market ETFs have enjoyed solid runs since stock markets around the world nose dived in March. The Pakistan ETF has risen 42% since March, while the Poland ETF is up 25%. For big growth, it can pay to look overseas.There’s no shortage of momentum stocks on Robinhood’s Top 100 list. In fact, one good argue the list is made up of mostly momentum stocks, which are stocks whose price has been rising very fast.Companies whose stock has proven to be extremely popular with Robinhood traders tend to be momentum stocks. Companies such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM), Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) and Draftkings (NASDAQ:DKNG) have each seen their stock price rise more than 300% this year. ZM stock is up 564% year-to-date. These are huge momentum stocks that continue to defy expectations and run higher and higher.There are two ways to look at momentum stocks. Bulls tend to take the view that stocks that have run higher will continue to do so, while bears caution that momentum stocks are overvalued and may run out of steam, correcting sharply and costing investors money.Some of the most successful investors caution against chasing momentum stocks. If you didn’t buy Zoom stock when it was trading at $68 a share in January of this year, don’t buy it at $451 a share in November. However, for investors seeking big growth, momentum stocks can be irresistible.The key is to look at the companies of momentum stocks and try to assess whether they are likely to continue rising. Will Tesla be able to maintain its momentum as it faces increasing competition in the electric vehicle market? Will Zoom be trading over $500 a share once there is a vaccine against Covid-19 and people return to the office? These are the kinds of issues you want to weight when investing in momentum stocks.Options trading is when investors bet on whether they feel a stock’s price is going to rise or fall over a certain period of time, say within one to six months. With options contracts, investors pay a premium in order to buy or sell a stock or other security at a predetermined price at any time during the duration of the contract.Options contracts can be beneficial provided that a stock’s price moves in the direction that an investor expects. Many of the stocks found in Robinhood’s Top 100 are popular with options traders, including semiconductor company Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and online payment company Square (NYSE:SQ).When engaging in options trading, it is wise for investors to think about the direction they see the entire market moving in coming months, as stocks tend to rise and fall with the wider market or within specific sectors.Volatility plays a big part in options trading. The more volatile a stock’s price (how often it rises and falls) can make it harder to predict which direction it will ultimately move and it can be riskier for investors. When trading options, stocks with high volatility are more expensive than those with low volatility. Investors with a high risk tolerance who are chasing growth might be comfortable trading options of volatile stocks. But investors with a lower risk tolerance may want to consider trading options of more stable stocks.Before buying an options contract, look at the historical volatility of the security to see how it has fluctuated over a one or two-year period.With micro-cap stocks, we’re talking about publicly-traded companies that have a market capitalization between $50 million and $300 million. Micro-cap companies are high risk because many of them have unproven products, no solid history, assets, sales or even operations.Lack of liquidity and a small shareholder base also can expose stocks of micro-cap companies to price shocks. Examples of micro-cap stocks found on the Robinhood Top 100 are companies such as biotechnology company iBio (NYSEAMERICAN:IBIO). While risky, these types of micro-cap companies also tend to outperform the broader stock market during bull runs. For example, from 2008 to 2018, the Dow Jones Select Micro-Cap Index provided an annualized return of 11.6%, while the S&P 500 Index returned an annualized 10.37%.Investing in micro-cap stocks can inject a portfolio with big growth. However, it can be risky to invest in individual micro-cap companies. IBIO stock, for example, ran up more than 2,000% earlier this year, reaching a high of $6.41 a share before crashing down to under $2 a share today.To mitigate some of the risk while still earning growth off micro-cap companies, investors may want to consider putting money into one of several micro-cap exchange traded funds. Most of the major fund companies offer at least one micro-cap ETF. And they have been performing well this year. The iShares Micro-Cap ETF (NYSEARCA:IWC), for example, is up 72% since March of this year and has risen steadily in recent months.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.The post 4 Growth Investing Strategies to Pick From Robinhood’s Top 100 appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-growth-investing-strategies-to-pick-from-robinhoods-top-100-2020-11-04

Although some commentators attributed the move simply to a flight to more growth-oriented stocks, there was a definite sense of bullishness throughout the EV industry today.The Tesla Semi. Image source: Tesla.One thing driving excitement in the sector was the completion of the latest merger by a special purpose acquisition company. Lordstown Motors (NASDAQ: RIDE) started trading under its new ticker symbol on Tuesday, and its stock soared 22% after its combination with DiamondPeak Holdings went through.Moreover, investors seem to anticipate that the results of the election could be positive for players across the industry. China's NIO (NYSE: NIO) picked up another 7% Tuesday after a nice gain on Monday, while newly public Fisker (NYSE: FSR) rose 3%. Workhorse Group (NASDAQ: WKHS), which is closely connected to Lordstown, saw its shares rise 11%.The EV market is big enough to support Tesla and its host of smaller peers. If a transformation away from internal combustion vehicles takes place, then it's likely that one or more of Tesla's competitors will end up as a legacy automaker in the not-so-distant future.Not all stocks moved higher on Tuesday, though. Alibaba dropped more than 8% as the Chinese internet giant faced an unexpected setback in its efforts to tap the public capital markets.Alibaba had anticipated doing its initial public offering of its Ant Group today in Shanghai and Hong Kong, but regulators in China chose to suspend the IPO before it could occur. Ant Group is the company behind the popular Alipay digital wallet, which is a leading financial product in the Chinese market. The company is also a major money manager.Some news sources pointed to comments from Alibaba CEO Jack Ma that might have been more critical of financial regulators than the Chinese government would have liked. In explaining the IPO suspension, the Shanghai Stock Exchange pointed to the need for Ma and Ant Group CEO Eric Jing to meet with regulators to resolve issues related to the company and the financial industry.At this point, it's unclear when the IPO might occur or whether significant terms of the offering might change. With Ma having been set to have controlling interest in Ant Group once it was spun off, it might be necessary to arrange for a divestiture or other strategic move in order for the IPO to happen.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

30,"Nov 3, 2020 4:13PM EST","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe Nasdaq has been the leader among the indices out of the novel coronavirus pandemic crash. It’s up an impressive 26% year-to-date. But the recent heroes on Wall Street are comeback sectors like the solar stocks. Consensus is that First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) is the cream of the crop, much like Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) is to cannabis. However, First Solar stock is not leading the pack up. It’s “only” up 50% year to date. This makes me giggle a bit.The Invesco Solar ETF (NYSEARCA:TAN) is up twice as much and Sunrun (NASDAQ:RUN) five times. Even though it is the anointed best-of-breed by the experts, First Solar stock is lagging. But that could be a good thing.The whole sector got too hot and the October rally went too far too fast. The proof is that RUN fell 30% from its peak. Luckily, FSLR has only dipped half as much and is only 9% away from the peak. In this case, “lagging” served it well. However, let the debacle in RUN serve as a sobering example of what can happen here.Patience is key at these levels. Momentum stocks like these run fast in both directions. Chasing them into a hype rally is rarely a good idea. Today, we look for the right entries in First Solar stock.First Solar needs to consolidate some more. The rally started from a base of $60 per share. Then it took its second leg from the area around $77. For the bulls to go for higher-highs, they need to establish a better base. Don’t take my word for it, simply look left on the chart to how pivotal the $60 was in February. That marked a major fail point, so it serves as the base. This process will repeat near $98 per share.In fact, zoom out and you will find that $60 is the pivot that dates back to its IPO. A level this important brings out traders of both sides. This will serve as very strong support on bad days. Therefore, me suggesting that First Solar stock needs to dip shouldn’t scare investors. It would be part of normal price action to establish a better base.The monthly chart I shared highlights the range that has been in play since the beginning. Its upper limit is near $90 per share. The bulls broke out of it in 2007, but then lost it big time in 2011. They have not regained since then. Until they can prove they can, investors should assume that this edge is a place to fade First Solar stock. It’s up to the bulls to take it back this month. Otherwise, I suggest to buy-the-dip near $75 or $66 per share.It hasn’t been easy to bet on solar stocks. But as the old adage goes: “No risk, no reward.” Maybe this uptrend is the one that recovers the old glory lost in 2011 on Wall Street. Maybe the world is now ready to re-commit to renewable power. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has helped the solar cause by pushing its own ventures in energy and EVs. In that case, I would prefer to stick with the proven winner and leader in the sector. Those tend to be less exciting but also less of a gamble. FSLR stock is the one for me but on a pullback.The recent 50% rally was impressive, but it may have priced in the Biden victory. If that’s true, then from here it’s almost a no win situation. The Biden upside is temporarily priced in. If he loses, investors will leave the stock. My plan is to buy-the-dip if and when it comes.In conclusion, I like owning First Solar stock for the long term, but from a better base. That said, I would not short it either. If I am not already long after a rally like this one did, then I admit that I missed it. They say that patience is a virtue and that is the case here.On the date of publication, Nicolas Chahine did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.The post First Solar Stock Is the Best of Breed Among Solar Stocks appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/first-solar-stock-is-the-best-of-breed-among-solar-stocks-2020-11-03

31,"Nov 3, 2020 3:44PM EST","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNio (NYSE:NIO) has been on a tear in the past month. In fact, NIO stock is up 69% over that span and more than 1,000% the past six months. This is incredible, but whether this continues depends on how well the company performs and its outlook. Nio, a Chinese company that does not have to follow SEC quarterly reporting rules, will report its earnings on Nov. 17. However, the company recently provided an update on its October delivery performance.Nio reported on Nov. 2 that it delivered 5,055 electric vehicles (EVs), which was up 100.1% over the amount last year. And year-to-date, it has delivered 31,430 EVs — up 111.4%.Additionally, Nio reported on Oct. 2 that its September deliveries rose by 133.2% over last year with 4,708 EVs. Moreover, its third-quarter deliveries rose by 154.3% over last year with 12,206 deliveries.This also represents significant monthly progress. For example, in August it delivered 3,965 EVs, and in July there were 3,533 deliveries. So, the October deliveries were up 7.4% over September, and up 27.5% over August.So, think about that. In two months, its monthly deliveries are up by 27.5%. Therefore, let’s assume its average monthly increase is 13.75%. At this pace, Nio could deliver 5,750 in November, and 6,540 in December.That results in 17,345 estimated deliveries in Q4, or 42.1% more than the 12,206 in Q3, and 67.9% more than the 10,331 delivered in Q1. In turn, we can use this to estimate some numbers for NIO stock’s value.Let’s try to put some dollar numbers on these forecasts. I will try to make this fairly simple so that we can estimate what NIO stock is worth.Now, we know two things from the Q2 earnings report. First, Nio delivered 10,331 electric vehicles. Second, they had revenue of $493.4 million (Nio provided the conversion into dollars).Therefore, we can calculate the average selling price (ASP) of the Q2 EVs. If we divide $493.4 by 10,331 vehicles, the ASP is $47,759.Using this information, and assuming that ASPs increase by 1% per quarter, I estimate that the company will produce 43,720 EVs in 2020 with a total revenue of $2.1 billionHowever, my forecast for 2021 shows that revenue is set to explode. I increased slightly the monthly average delivery growth to 15% per month. This works out to 52% growth quarter-over-quarter. In addition, I kept the 1% quarterly ASP increase.The chart below shows my forecasts. It shows that by the end of 2021, Nio will have delivered 218,115 EVs. In addition, revenue will be $10.95 billion, or almost $11 billion.You can also see in the table on the right how I came up with this chart.For example, it shows how the average selling price (ASP) results in the quarterly revenue numbers.The quarterly numbers are based on monthly forecasts of approximately 15% gains each month during 2021.That said, you can see that the average quarterly growth in revenue is well over 53% each quarter during 2021. That is what is propelling the value in NIO stock.Keep in mind that Nio will deliver less than half of the deliveries that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is set to deliver this year. In fact, Tesla’s revenue is forecast to be $30.87 billion in 2020 and its present market value is $400 billion.This implies that NIO stock is worth a good deal more than its present price if these forecasts come about. For example, right now, at $48.5 billion, Nio’s market capitalization is more than 10% of Tesla’s.However, by the end of 2021, it is forecast to produce about 44% of cars that Tesla will produce this year. Its revenue could be $11 billion, or 35.8% of Tesla’s revenue.As a result, it is likely that the market might push NIO stock up to 35.8% or more of Tesla’s present market value. That works out to $131.74 billion.Therefore, assuming no more capital raises, and not taking into account profitability differences, NIO stock will be worth 3.17 times more (i.e., $131.7 billion divided by $41.6 billion). This implies a price for NIO stock of $105.52 per share (i.e., 3.167 times its price today, Nov. 2, of $33.32 per share).Overall, hang on to your hat. If Nio continues in this growth trajectory, we can expect NIO stock will continue to move up quite dramatically.On the date of publication, Mark R.

32,"Nov 3, 2020 3:37PM EST","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEmails. Push notifications. Your college friends on social media. All these sources have likely reminded you a hundred times that today is Election Day, and a lot is at stake in the United States. If you want to be an informed American — and a prepared investor — what should you be watching? Here is an all-encompassing guide to what you should be watching in the stock market today. You should first understand the narrative. What is happening? Well, one of the biggest differences with the 2020 election is the rise of early voting. Driven by the novel coronavirus and concerns over crowded polling places, many Americans exercised the rights to vote ahead of Election Day. In fact, as many as 100 million Americans took this pandemic-friendly option.However, each state has different protocols for counting these votes. This means that tonight, as polls close around the country, partial results will largely reflect whichever ballots get counted first.Night-of results are always partial, and take several days to certify. However, because of the rise of early and mail-in votes, as well as fears that the election format will contribute to voter fraud, there is a high level of stress heading into tonight. Investors need to remember not to panic. Keep your emotions in check and read up on behavioral finance strategies.Right now, former Vice President Joe Biden maintains his lead over President Donald Trump. But unless you have a crystal ball, there is no way to know who will win. Either way, InvestorPlace has you covered. Here are the top three trends to watch, and where we are looking for news tonight.Stock Market Futures: Stock market futures were a big talking point during the 2016 presidential election, and may well be volatile again tonight. As the clock approached midnight in 2016, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures shed 870 points. Panic set in. A victory by Trump over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton shocked many. But then, things turned around. Just a few hours later, as Trump delivered his victory speech, futures had started to rebound.Remember that trend from 2016 heading into tonight. Just as quickly as panic can set in and selling can start, a wave of optimism can take hold of the market.Cryptocurrencies: Unlike stock market futures, cryptocurrencies had very little immediate reaction to the 2016 election results. However, we are seeing a rally in bitcoin (CCC:BTC) in the stock market today. That could very well be because the leading cryptocurrency is relatively election-proof — with all of the chaos, a Republican or Democratic victory could boost the case for digital currency.We may not see major moves tonight or tomorrow, but know that crypto bulls are ready to come out in full force. InvestorPlace contributor Josh Enomoto even wrote today that we could soon see bitcoin make a run for $20,000.Renewable Energy Plays: Right now Wall Street is almost certain that Biden will win. If he does, renewable energy stocks will be immediate beneficiaries. Importantly, some of these names have also been pushing higher in the stock market today. Keep an eye on electric vehicle names like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Fisker (NYSE:FSR) and General Motors (NYSE:GM). Also watch battery play QuantumScape (NYSE:KCAC) and charging station companies Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK) and ChargePoint (NYSE:SBE). Lastly, make sure to keep solar firms like First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) and Sunrun (NASDAQ:RUN) on your radar.If you want to know exactly how election results will play out in the stock market, make sure to follow along with our election blog in real time.

As of 10:45 a.m. EST, the stock was up about 5%.The stock's gain is likely fueled primarily by optimism in the overall market on Tuesday.

It's not surprising, therefore, to see Tesla stock up sharply.Some of the accumulation of Tesla stock today may reflect the possibility of Joe Biden winning the election. Democrats typically implement more favorable renewable energy policies. As a maker of electric cars, solar panels, and energy storage products, Tesla could benefit from invigorated government support for these new technologies.Investors should remain focused on Tesla's underlying business and the company's long-term potential.

34,"Nov 3, 2020 11:24AM EST","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLate September, Ford stock embarked on a 30% rally. If you bought it late you are stuck down 7% from the high. Those investors are wondering where have all the bids gone? Before the rally, Ford stock had been depressed for a long while. Then Wall Street went on a buying spree. Now is the time to try and find the next move from here. When everyone else feared it was the wrong time to go long, a bit of homework rewarded investors well. Early in July I shared a bullish bet on Ford. The rally from there to the October top was 36%. My message then was simple: “Bet on the F stock bounce into next year.”Back then, Ford was languishing. Now it’s not.Sometimes the bullish bet is simple. Ford is still a great American company with a rare type of fan base. It’s just too bad the love on Main Street didn’t extend to Wall Street this whole time. Ford stock would not have languished for so long if it did.I blame management because they failed to give investors reasons to chase it. Recently, there is a rekindling of interest and traders have come back. The reason for this renewed interest is perhaps the Bronco lineup. General Motors (NYSE:GM) is also helping auto stocks because they too are moving and shaking. GM recently announced the return of the Hummer, but this time it’s an electric vehicle. The success of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) clearly lit a fire under their seats. Once the target of the jokes, it’s now the inspiration for the auto giants.Now the question is for how long will this love last, and how far can Ford stock go?There are no easy answers to this, but we can start by defining the time frame for the trade. For investors who want to own Ford shares for many years, now is as good a time as any. A few pennies up or down won’t matter much. However, those who are more active and picking levels need a bit of homework.Fundamentally, the stock is inexpensive from the traditional sense. The forward price-to-earnings ratio is 8x and the price-to-sales ratio is 0.24x. This means only one-third of a year’s worth of sales is baked into the current price of Ford stock. That’s the opposite of “hopium,” which reduces the likelihood of downside risk.It’s easier for the price to rise than to fall, especially inside this bullish market. Yes, Wall Street bulls are still completely in charge of Ford despite its recent bad days. It’s normal that volatility is this high going into a hot election week. But this too shall pass. And when stocks go back to trading fundamentals, not headlines, investors will buy the dip.There is an old saying that “price is truth.” In reality, this is the secret sauce that serves us traders best in the short term. Technically, all the information we need to plot trajectories is in the charts. Finding the ranges and levels that matter is easy once you know what to seek.There are two trade setups for Ford stock next. The first is to chase the breakout above $8.40 because it would at least target $9.50 per share. This won’t be easy, so patience is key. You should expect a fight.The second trade is to buy-the-dip into the support near $7.25 per share. There will be buyers there and they will support the rally. Make no mistake about it — the bears are still in charge of the price action in Ford stock. Expect them to sell the rips until the trend reverses. There is a move coming because the range is pinpoint tight. The daily chart is setting higher-lows and lower-highs. This builds tremendous energy that needs an outlet.However, we do not know the direction of the move yet, so wait for triggers.Now let’s address the elephant in the room: The headline stream. These are outside risks that will affect Ford stock this month. First, we have the U.S. presidential election. Voting ends on Tuesday, but the fight will linger for days … maybe weeks. Wall Street hates uncertainty and that’s the kind they won’t ignore. Then there are the slew of economic reports ending in the major Non-Farm Payroll report on Friday. If that wasn’t enough, the Federal Reserve will have its day on Wednesday after their meeting concludes.All of these factors will bear down on stocks more broadly, and Ford won’t necessarily be immune. As such, patience and caution are needed moving forward.On the date of publication, Nicolas Chahine did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.The post Ford Stock Is Geared Up to Continue Its Rally appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ford-stock-is-geared-up-to-continue-its-rally-2020-11-03

But a presentation at the product launch said the starting price of the SUVs, which are larger than Tesla's China-made Model 3 sedans, would be less than 250,000 yuan ($37,450) after electric vehicle subsidies from the Chinese government.The starting price for Model 3 sedans in China is currently 249,900 yuan, after subsidies.The ID.4 models will have driving ranges of over 400 kilometers and offer over-the-air software updates, Volkswagen executives said at the event.China chief Stephan Woellenstein said Volkswagen would roll out eight ID. family electric models in China by 2023.Sales of electric, plug-in hybrid and hydrogen-powered vehicles in China are forecast to rise to 20% of new car sales by 2025 from just 5% now, the State Council said on Monday.Around 1.1 million such vehicles are expected to be sold in China this year.

36,"Nov 3, 2020 8:18AM EST","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFisker (NYSE:FSR) may have found a bottom. After a sharp plunge that took 37% off its value in a little over two weeks, FSR stock rallied 13% on Friday.The closing of the merger with SPAC (special purpose acquisition company) Spartan Energy is a possible catalyst: Friday was the first day the stock traded under the ticker FSR. Whatever the cause, the rally seems overdue.After all, it simply seems like FSR stock has sold off with its sector. Industry leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has pulled back 23%. Kensington Capital (NYSE:KCAC), a SPAC which is merging with battery manufacturer QuantumScape, has been halved. The same is true for Lordstown Motors (NASDAQ:RIDE).But the case for Fisker looks stronger than some of the other sector plays. Valuation seems reasonable. The cars are impressive. And the market looks attractive.The sell-off in the sector more broadly does make some sense: valuations had become stretched, and investors were bidding up even the weakest electric vehicle names. At this point, however, the sell-off likely is closer to the end than the beginning. If that’s the case, Friday’s bounce in Fisker stock may just be part of a bigger rally.It’s impossible to precisely pin down what FSR stock is worth at the moment. This is a company that doesn’t even expect to start production until 2023. Growth of the EV market as a whole will be determined by broader macroeconomic fears (which in turn will be influenced by the progression of the novel coronavirus pandemic) as well as government subsidies.Share in that market will be hotly contested. It’s not just Tesla that Fisker will compete against, but legacy manufacturers like Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM).In that context, any estimate of future revenue and profits is going to be uncertain at best.Still, from a broad perspective, it does seem like FSR’s valuation is at least reasonable. At $10, the company’s market capitalization is less than 1% that of Tesla, and about one-fourteenth that of China’s Nio (NYSE:NIO).There’s one more thing to note relative to other SPACs: FSR is back at the merger price of $10. And that, too, suggests valuation is reasonable.After all, if the company is willing to sell stock at $10 to fund its business, the company itself (and the institutional investors who bought in a private placement at the same time) see that price as attractive. Other SPACs — DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) and even Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) are just two examples — have traded well above the merger price. In those scenarios, investors are paying $35 (for DKNG) and $17 (for SPCE) for stock that the company was willing to sell at $10.Again, it’s difficult to precisely pin down fair value at the moment. But at the least, it’s certain that this is not a stock priced for market leadership. It’s priced as a niche manufacturer at best. But Fisker seems to have a good chance of getting to at least that position in the market.After all, Fisker Inc. was founded by Henrik Fisker, one of the most well-regarded auto designers in the world. Even a cursory look at the cars shows real appeal. And with a base price starting at $40,000, the Ocean SUV seems well-positioned.The Ocean will be competing against Tesla in the SUV space, certainly. But it’s worth noting that Model X deliveries have flat-lined, and the Ocean remains cheaper than the X and even the mid-size Y.GM admittedly is going full-bore into EVs. But it hasn’t proven that it can be a winner outside of gasoline engines. The same is true for the likes of BMW (OTCMKTS:BMWYY) and Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY).Certainly, nothing is guaranteed. Fisker has a lot of work left to do. But there’s a path to establishing a viable business via the Ocean, and from there the company (as did Tesla) can expand into new models and new categories. If Fisker follows that path, FSR stock has plenty of room to run.All that said, this is not a stock for risk-averse investors. Fisker Inc. is Henrik Fisker’s second effort. His first, Fisker Automotive, went bankrupt in 2013.There’s a risk that Fisker Inc. will end up in a similar situation. The SPAC merger and the private placement combined raised about $1 billion in capital. That capital will be spent simply getting to production. If Fisker stumbles before it gets to production, FSR stock can take a huge hit.But even with the rally on Friday, the rewards seem worth the risks. It’s true that success isn’t guaranteed. It’s also true that success isn’t priced in.On the date of publication, Vince Martin did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.After spending time at a retail brokerage, Vince Martin has covered the financial industry for close to a decade for InvestorPlace.com and other outlets.The post A Steep Sell-Off Leaves Fisker as an Intriguing Play for EV Bulls appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/a-steep-sell-off-leaves-fisker-as-an-intriguing-play-for-ev-bulls-2020-11-03

37,"Nov 3, 2020 6:27AM EST","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI don’t like most of the electric car companies that emerged in the wake of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Switchback Energy (NYSE:SBE) and SBE stock is an exception.Switchback is a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). It is designed to take ChargePoint, which produces electric vehicle charging equipment, into the public market.Think of ChargePoint as the gas station of the electric vehicle revolution.ChargePoint was founded in 2007 to sell networked charging hardware and services to fleet owners. It now has 4,000 customers and more than 115,000 charging ports. It manages another 133,000 through roaming contracts.This has given the company an early lead in the electric vehicle charging market, It claims a 44% market share. Vehicle charging is a fast-growing market, with several segments.Most ports are simple conversions of AC wall power to partly charge a vehicle overnight. Most of the chargers you’ll see on the street are called Level 2. These can fully charge a vehicle overnight, or top your charge up while you’re going around town. ChargePoint is the leader in Level 2.Then there are Level 3 chargers that can charge a vehicle in a half-hour. ChargePoint calls its Level 3 charger DC Fast. It uses DC power. Each type of charger also uses different plugs. Tesla cars carry a custom Level 3 plug, but it offers adapters for other types of Level 3 chargers and for Level 2.The initial opportunity is in hardware, and that’s where the market is now. But it won’t always be there.Companies are still signing alliances with car makers and fleet owners. As large enterprises like UPS (NYSE:UPS) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) switch to electric delivery vehicles, there will be huge contracts where scale will matter. Over time service, software and maintenance all create huge revenue streams.Thus the “hockey stick graphs,” showing enormous growth over the next several years, are out in force for the sector. A market worth $1.7 billion last year could be worth $18.5 billion in six years.A lot of smart money is also backing ChargePoint.Former oil magnate Kyle Bass, who now runs a hedge fund called Hayman Capital, recently bought 9% of the SPAC taking ChargePoint public. He sees electrics taking 10% of the car market by 2025, and a third of it by 2030. A private funding round worth $226 million attracted such companies as Kleiner Perkins.There is competition from companies like Switzerland’s ABB (NYSE:ABB), Schneider Electric (OTCMKTS:SBGSY) of France, Eaton (NYSE:ETN), and Germany’s Siemens (OTCMKTS:SIEGY). Most are focused on hardware sales and are large conglomerates.Chargepoint is focused on electric vehicle charging and takes a holistic approach. It should also have the capital to grow at what Bass calls “ludicrous speed” thanks to the SPAC deal, which values it at $2.4 billion.Other Investorplace writers have gotten to Chargepoint ahead of me. They have good things to say.Louis Navillier suggests you can invest directly in the SPAC, noting ChargePoint could have 2.5 million stations in 2025.Once ChargePoint’s merger with Switchback is complete, Mark Hake thinks it could be worth 56% more than it is now. Josh Enomoto says you can trust ChargePoint to deliver. Chris Lau says it has the potential to jump 400%.These are endorsements that should intrigue an investor in their 30s or 40s. You’re on the ground floor of a big trend and you’ve got the market leader.I think you’re a few years away from the big return, but your patience may well be rewarded.At the time of publication, Dana Blankenhorn had long positions in AMZN.Dana Blankenhorn has been a financial and technology journalist since 1978.

38,"Nov 3, 2020 6:01AM EST","Investors were ecstatic when Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) announced a 4-for-1 stock split back in late July. The first stock split in six years created a wave of buying in the tech giant's shares, sending the stock to record highs and Apple's valuation above the $2 trillion mark.The split happened in late August, and investors have had a couple of months to let the dust settle. For many shareholders, things didn't play out the way they'd hoped. Here are a few things Apple investors learned the hard way -- and why it might not turn out all that badly for investors in the end.Shares of Apple soared following the split's announcement, and they just kept on climbing throughout August. Investors were so excited about the prospect of getting more shares that Apple saw a more than 40% share-price boost.AAPL data by YCharts.As you can see above, though, that hype turned out to be short-lived. In fact, the stock started giving up its gains within days following the completion of the split. Those who bought Apple at the very top ended up suffering a loss of almost 20%.That behavior was consistent with the experience of many past stock splits. The move gets a lot of attention until it's done, and then investors have to refocus on fundamentals. That doesn't always turn out poorly for shareholders, but it does often make a pullback more likely.Brokerage companies knew investors would anxiously watch the Apple stock split, especially since it came while Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) was also moving forward with a split of its own. Millions of investors had at least one of those stocks in their portfolios, creating a challenge for the operations departments of the largest stockbrokers.In at least some cases, investors found that their portfolios didn't immediately reflect the additional shares they received due to the split. However, online accounts did usually reflect the updated price. Therefore, some people saw what looked like a 75% plunge in the value of their Apple shares -- and others had their Apple positions simply taken off their holdings entirely while the transaction was processed.For those who weren't day trading the stock, brokerage issues weren't of immediate concern, but many were still shocked to see their account value plunge unexpectedly. Brokers fixed the problem quickly, so those who don't check their accounts frequently were spared the worry.Image source: Apple.The stock split distracted from Apple's fundamental business performance. Once the split was over, investors turned their attention back to what really matters.Going into the key holiday season, Apple investors are looking at the company's newest products. On the hardware side, there's the new 5G-capable iPhone 12 lineup, as well as new versions of the Apple Watch and iPad. New services include a planned Fitness+ online exercise program, as well as the expected Apple One bundle of television, music, and other service offerings.Some will be unhappy with the decline in Apple's stock price after the split, but fundamentally, the iPhone giant is hitting on all cylinders and has plenty of opportunities for future growth. In the long run, whether you bought the tech stock at $130 or $110 should become increasingly unimportant if Apple can sustain its recent pace of growth.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

39,"Nov 3, 2020 6:00AM EST","By John McCrank and Imani MoiseNEW YORK, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Retail investors have been a growing force in 2020, exploding in numbers during lockdowns and helping fuel the rebound in stocks from pandemic-driven lows. Now, as election-related volatility spikes, this new cohort sees opportunities.Day traders are tapping resources online and in virtual communities to position themselves for what could be a bumpy ride depending on how long it takes to resolve Election Day uncertainties.In the past year, traditional online brokerages like Charles Schwab Corp SCHW.N and Fidelity joined upstarts like Robinhood in getting rid of trading fees, while also allowing users to buy slices of individual shares, making it easier than ever before for anyone to own a piece of a company.When stock prices plunged in March and governments and central banks flooded the economy with liquidity, millions of would-be investors saw an attractive entry point and downloaded trading apps on their mobile phones.""It's just something I picked up as a hobby,"" said Sam Freeman, 23, a cancer researcher in Chicago, who said he started day trading in April after seeing a conversation on options trading on Twitter. He has been trading Microsoft Corp MSFT.O options and said he made money off a rally around Tesla Inc's  TSLA.O stock split.With the election at hand, he is leaning on a Slack Technologies Inc WORK.N group comprised of a few thousand retail traders with various levels of experience, and social media, to position himself.He said he is betting on a victory by Democrat Joe Biden over Republican Donald Trump, followed by a sharp market sell-off.But with a record number of early ballots having already been cast, the results may come in later than in previous years, which ""could increase volatility in the market especially in the event of a close outcome,"" Barclays said in a research note. Despite the volatility that has been a hallmark of 2020, record numbers of individuals have been tapping the markets.Three million new Robinhood accounts were opened in the first four months of 2020, the brokerage said. TD Ameritrade, which was recently bought by Schwab, said more than 1.2 million new funded accounts were opened on its platform in the first half of the year and usage of the firm's educational resources is up more than three times that of 2019.""The retail investor has the ability to be much more sophisticated than ever before,"" said Spencer Mindlin, an analyst at Aite Group.Along with near-frictionless trading and a bevy of educational materials, the rise of retail is partly due to the tech-savvy, independent-minded millennials coming of age, he added.""It's more about do-it-yourself, like DIY YouTube videos on how to invest your money,"" he said.Jaidan Craig, 23, of Provo, Utah, said he has been investing for a few years and regularly posts investing videos for his YouTube channel's nearly 2,000 followers. He said he aims to emulate Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater, the world's biggest hedge fund, who espouses ideas like diversifying portfolios across different asset classes.Craig invests some money every week, and lately, he said he has found stocks too pricey, so he has been holding more cash. If stock prices drop due to election uncertainty, he will treat it as a buying opportunity.""The main thing is just investing more of my cash, deploy more of that into stocks as they drop,"" he said.The surge of new retail investors benefits the market in many ways, such as promoting financial literacy and bringing more attention to a wider variety of companies than institutional investors tend to focus on, said James Angel, a finance professor at Georgetown University.""Individual investors bring a lot to the table,"" he said.To be sure, those investors are not always going to hit home runs, he added.Retail investors can be bitten by sophisticated strategies in which losses can stack up if markets turn, such as trading on margin, using derivatives or betting on highly speculative stocks.Early this summer, seasoned traders were scratching their heads as retail traders bid up bankrupt or soon-to-be-bankrupt stocks, like Hertz HTZ.N, Chesapeake, Whiting WLL.N and JC Penney, which had a rollercoaster ride, drawing comparisons to casino gambling. ""But some college kid with $25 to spare can basically afford to lose that playing on a fractional share on some popular trading app,"" rather than spending the cash on avocado toast, Angel said.ANALYSIS-Investors brace for another wild ride on U.S. Election Night(Reporting by John McCrank and Imani Moise in New York Editing by Megan Davies and Matthew Lewis)((john.mccrank@thomsonreuters.com Twitter @jmccrank; 1 646 223-6643; Reuters Messaging: john.mccrank.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysis-retail-traders-position-for-volatility-after-u.s.-election-2020-11-03

40,"Nov 3, 2020 5:01AM EST","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFisker Motors (NYSE:FSR) has completed its merger with Spartan Energy Acquisition, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), and begun trading on the New York Stock Exchange.It’s just one of the slew of SPACs that have helped the NYSE gain on the NASDAQ, as the Financial Times noted earlier this week. These blank check companies have raised $66 billion this year on the Big Board compared to $61 billion on the rival.The plan is to use roughly $1 billion of cash generated by the transaction to begin production of the Ocean, an electric SUV, at a contract manufacturing plant in Germany. The car would hit the market near the end of 2022.Before the deal was finalized, a lot of digital ink was spilled, even here at InvestorPlace, about the SPAC. Thomas Niel wanted you to wait until the stock hit single digits.  (It closed Nov. 2 down 2.1% at $8.96.) It’s on “a road to nowhere,” wrote our Lou Carlozo. It’s “only for those who can handle the heat,” opined Josh Enomoto.While it’s there’s speculation in the SPAC, is it really all bad?Fisker is one of several start-ups aiming to compete with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in electric vehicles (EVs). Most have some connection to General Motors (NYSE:GM).GM has an investment in Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) and its electric truck. Workhorse Group (NASDAQ:WKHS) wants to use an old GM plant in Cincinnati to make EVs for the Post Office. Lordstown Motors (NASDAQ:RIDE) wants to build pick-ups in an old GM assembly plant.Fisker wasn’t built that way. Founder Henrik Fisker has been trying to get his company off the ground since 2007. After his initial plan crashed and burned, Fisker went back to the drawing board with Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO), unveiling a prototype in January.After failing to come up with an agreement to use Volkswagen’s (OTCMKTS:VLKAY) electric vehicle design, he made the current deal with contract manufacturer Magna International (NYSE:MGA).The VW connection remains important, however. Fisker has not yet closed off the connection. VW sees its modular electric drive matrix (MEB) platform, which includes the battery and drive train, as a global standard. Vehicles using the standard are already rolling off Chinese assembly lines. In addition to committing lines like Audi to the platform, VW also has a deal with Ford Motor (NYSE:F) to manufacture MEB products in the U.S. starting in 2023.Fisker, a Dane who got his start designing luxury cars, is who you’re betting on if you buy FSR stock. Fisker has the swagger of Elon Musk but comes at the problem from a different direction, namely design.This means there’s a lot of flashy marketing, aimed at big investors, small investors and consumers of luxury goods. The SPAC transaction means Fisker has the cash to execute initial manufacturing. If he gets sell-through, he has the connections to scale.But it’s all a high-wire act, as our Alex Sirois notes. Electric cars are a revolution, but it’s unclear whether Tesla, start-ups or existing players will win the market. Fisker is a start-up with connections to existing players, which seems like the best of both worlds.History says Fisker is as likely to wind up as Preston Tucker as he is Walter Chrysler or Elon Musk. Musk’s success has thrown the whole industry into the air and there’s enormous uncertainty where it will come down.Making an electric car, however, is just half of the current revolution. Making cars autonomous is the other half. Most of the start-ups, including Fisker, are emphasizing drivers and style first.Contributor Tim Yeung considers Fisker a good speculation, thanks to Fisker and his team of VW veterans. My own view is that making a car electric is the easy part. The computer technology end — providing safety, reducing the need for drivers and interacting with other vehicles to create a transport system — isn’t here yet.I’m going to wait for it.On the date of publication, Dana Blankenhorn did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.Dana Blankenhorn has been a financial and technology journalist since 1978.

41,"Nov 3, 2020 1:40AM EST","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsElectric vehicle upstart and last-mile delivery specialist Workhorse (NASDAQ:WKHS) has had more than its share of controversy in 2020. This has been reflected in the wild price action of WKHS stock. Investors have every reason to wonder where this roller-coaster ride will end.Back in August, I recommend a position in WKHS stock because the company had introduced the idea of the HorseFly, which is Workhorse’s name for an autonomous four-rotor drone that could make last-mile delivery cheaper and more efficient.Since I issued my bullish outlook on WKHS stock, the share price has completed a crazy up-and-down round trip. Along the way, Roth Capital’s Craig Irwin downgraded the stock from a “buy” to a “hold” while slashing his price target on WKHS to $27.The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) delaying its contract decision might be a contributing factor in Irwin’s downgrade as well as the pullback in the WKHS stock price. But then, could a little HorseFly help Workhorse get its mojo back, even without a USPS contract?I’ll be the first to admit that the possibility of Workhorse winning a USPS contract for 140,000 electric mail trucks (Workhorse is among three finalists) has been a prime mover of the WKHS stock price.Another major influence has been the moves in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Other electric-vehicle names tend to follow TSLA stock. When the market sentiment is bullish on Tesla, the WKHS stock price often rises.In light of these factors, the ascent of WKHS stock from less than $3 in May to a 52-week high of $30.99 in September makes a little bit more sense. And, so does the share price’s decline to $15 and change in October.At the very least, we can say that the WKHS stock price is more reasonable now. Coming down from nearly $31 in September and October isn’t necessarily a bad thing. If anything, it’s a buying opportunity for prospective investors.Since the USPS delayed its decision on awarding a federal contract that’s potentially worth $8.1 billion, some traders have expressed concerns about WKHS stock. InvestorPlace contributor Faizan Farooque, for instance, suggested that “investors have already priced in the contract before it’s awarded.”Larry Ramer, another InvestorPlace contributor, provided the details on a firm issuing a scathing report and even taking a short position:“On Oct. 8, short-seller Fuzzy Panda Research issued a report in which it stated that it believes that Workhorse has no chance of winning a huge deal to provide USPS with new vehicles. Workhorse bid on the $6 billion deal along with its partner, VT Hackney.”I’ve seen some WKHS stock bulls go through extreme mental gymnastics. They’ll sometimes stretch the bounds of logic in order to defend the supposition that Workhorse will win the USPS contract.To them, I say, “Let it go.” Workhorse can still thrive as a company even without that lucrative contract from the USPS.So, let’s get off of the topic of the USPS contract for a moment. Right now, I feel that it’s a good time to talk about drones. Workhorse CEO Duane Hughes certainly doesn’t seem to mind talking about them.One can’t blame Hughes for wanting to discuss drones. After all, his company recently submitted a formal “Type Certification” application to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for Workhorse’s HorseFly drone.Perhaps I shouldn’t call the HorseFly a “drone.” The correct technical term is “unmanned aerial system” or “UAS.” Either way, submitting a “Type Certification” is a big step towards establishing the HorseFly’s airworthiness.The FAA has strict standards for airworthiness, no doubt. But then, the HorseFly UAS has been designed to meet those standards. Indeed, it’s been validated for use with “approximately 80% of most commercial package sizes, shapes, and weights.”Moreover, the HorseFly has “demonstrated the ability to carry a ten-pound payload up to 10 miles.” That’s pretty impressive for a little drone. As I see it, the HorseFly could be the key to Workhorse’s future success, with or without the USPS.It’s understandable that traders are focused on the USPS contract. This has been a major influence on the WKHS stock price. The movement of TSLA stock also has to be considered.Yet, let’s not discount the importance of Workhorse’s drone/UAS technology. The HorseFly could absolutely be a game changer. It might even help the WKHS stock bulls stage a comeback. And just maybe, Workhorse can thrive without a USPS contract.On the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.The post Workhorse Stock Can Turn Around Even Without a USPS Deal appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/workhorse-stock-can-turn-around-even-without-a-usps-deal-2020-11-03

42,"Nov 2, 2020 4:56PM EST","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhen former Vice President Joe Biden announced his $2 trillion climate plan, investors immediately began pouring their money into solar companies like Sunrun (NASDAQ:RUN). Between this and its recent merger with rival Vivint, RUN stock has risen more than 200% since Biden cinched the Democratic nomination back in June. Investors will undoubtedly continue pouring money into the newly combined firm, the largest pure-play solar company now on the market. But while “hot money” will push up the company’s stock price in the short run, it would take a 5x to 8x gain for Sunrun to refinance its terrible debts. And unless that happens, investors will eventually realize that Sunrun (despite its name) isn’t a solar company. Instead, it’s a financing one, specializing in leasing solar panels back to customers at a loss.With Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) elbowing its way into the industry, Sunrun’s profitability problems will compound. That’s because, no matter how much you scale, you can’t ever become profitable by selling $1 bills for 90 cents.As a high-growth tech analyst, I appreciate the power of investor mania. Some bubbles, such as the 1997 tech boom, allowed companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to raise cheap capital and eventually become world-beating companies.Today, Sunrun has a chance to become the next Amazon of clean energy. Investor hype over alternative energy stocks, combined with a catalyst from the White House, will propel the stock higher in the short run. If this lasts long enough, Sunrun could issue new shares, wiping out $3.1 billion of long-term debts (net of deferred revenues), and potentially show some minor profits. Its merger with Vivint may consolidate the market far enough as well to boost nominal profits. That would send the stock even higher, creating a virtuous feedback loop.Once the Biden-driven solar mania begins to cool, however, investors will quickly realize that residential solar power has been a terrible business from an economic standpoint — witness the epic collapse of SunEdison in 2016. And unless Sunrun weans itself off its money-losing financing business, it will head in the same direction too.Residential solar doesn’t profit from consumer demand. Instead, it’s far more of a financing operation like GE Capital or Ford Capital, which rely on cheap capital to make ends meet. That means, no matter how efficient solar panels become, Sunrun won’t receive the benefits.Sunrun’s core offering involves installing “beautiful, money-saving solar panels on your roof for as little as zero dollars upfront. Z-E-R-O,” according to the company’s website. The company then leases back the rights for the power (or to sell it off) for a flat fee, typically on 20-year terms. From a financial standpoint, that means borrowing the $15,000 to $29,000 it takes to outfit a customer’s roof, repaying that loan with customer rents, and keeping the profits for themselves.To report its profits, the company uses an unorthodox metric known as “unlevered NPV,” the net present value of a customer that’s the difference between “Project Value” and “Creation Costs” (yet more unconventional measures). In Q2, that came to 51 cents per watt, down from $1.11 the year before. In other words, Sunrun’s management would like you to believe the company earns 51 cents for every watt produced.There’s just one problem: “unlevered NPV” appears to ignore reality altogether.Among other issues, the measure completely ignores loan interest charges, uses a 6% discount rate, and doesn’t seem to account for future replacement costs of aging solar panels.A reality check shows a company that’s spent $5.2 billion in capital expenditure since 2013 to install 1,987 megawatts of power, but generated only $107.5 million in gross income from customer agreements and incentives in 2019. Even before considering $275 million in sales and marketing costs, that’s a gross return of just 2%. It’s an unsustainable business model at current rates.So how much is left over for Sunrun investors? A bankruptcy court might be a better judge of that answer.The residential solar industry’s original sin was to compete on price. The only way to switch customers over, they reasoned, was to undercut public utilities.There’s one problem: public utilities are frighteningly efficient compared to piece-meal solar panels on single-family residences. Even when adding 36% in delivery costs for public utilities, it’s hard to compete against 1) massive solar farms that are, 2) built in the best locations and 3) outfitted with tracking systems to always face panels towards the sun.Tesla’s push into the industry will also ensure the Sunrun/Vivint merger won’t push up rates. The carmaker, which bought SolarCity in 2016, promises a cost of $1.89/W before incentives. That’s almost half the cost of Sunrun’s technology.The company must perform three miracles to succeed. First, management needs to stop using unconventional metrics. It’s not fooling anyone (except maybe themselves). Investors have already sold short 18 million RUN shares, or around 20% of the company’s free float.Second, Sunrun should shed its financing operation and become a pure-play solar developer/reseller. In other words, become more like Ford (NYSE:F) (which makes and sells automobiles) and less like Ford Credit (the branch that deals with vehicle-related financing and leasing). Sunrun already generates around 55% of its revenue from product sales, so why keep pumping money into a cash-burning financing operation?Finally, Sunrun MUST slim down where it matters. In 2019, the company spent 46% of its revenue on marketing and overhead costs (SG&A). That’s as bloated as companies get. That’s even true in the high-growth world: Tesla spent just 11% on SG&A in 2019, choosing instead to channel a far higher portion than Sunrun into R&D.If Sunrun can achieve these three things, the company could skyrocket. The Energy Information Administration predicts renewables will overtake natural gas as the single largest energy source by 2042, with solar making up almost half. And in the short term, RUN stock will benefit from a green-focused Biden presidency.But to become the next Amazon of solar energy, Sunrun’s management needs to start thinking like investors and shed their unprofitable businesses. And they had better work quickly. After all, Tesla is coming.On the date of publication, Tom Yeung did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Tom Yeung, CFA, is a registered investment advisor on a mission to bring simplicity to the world of investing.The post Sunrun Stock Will Soar on a Biden Win, But Don’t Count on Long-Term Success appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/sunrun-stock-will-soar-on-a-biden-win-but-dont-count-on-long-term-success-2020-11-02

43,"Nov 2, 2020 2:17PM EST","China government officials are forecasting sales of non-gasoline-powered vehicles to jump to 20% of overall Chinese sales by 2025, from just 5% now.Sales of ""new energy vehicles,"" which include battery electric, plug-in hybrids, and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles, are expected to jump as the technology improves and the vehicles become more price competitive, according to a State Council report released Monday. The State Council is China's cabinet, and the forecast was included as part of the discussion around a new national five-year plan.Image source: Getty Images.China is the world's largest automotive market, and western companies, including incumbents like General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Volkswagen (OTC: VWAGY) as well as newcomers like Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), have raced to build share there. Tesla late last year began production at a new facility in Shanghai aimed at building vehicles for the Chinese market.Still, even with the added resources devoted to China, the growth target is ambitious. The State Council advocated for building out electric-vehicle (EV) charging locations and battery-swapping technologies to make EVs more accessible, and pushed for investment in new technologies.The government also wants to rework a green car quota system installed in place of alternative fuel subsidies and to push for more non-gasoline buses and trucks.The new target comes on the same day that Chinese electric-vehicle maker Nio (NYSE: NIO) reported October deliveries doubled from a year ago, breaking the 5,000-delivery threshold for the first time.10 stocks we like better than General MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

44,"Nov 2, 2020 10:54AM EST","Easy go, easy come. On Friday, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock closed out the month of October on a low note, falling 5.5% after Consumer Reports rated the company's Autopilot autonomous driving software ""a distant second"" to the Super Cruise driving tech offered by General Motors.Things could have continued going poorly for Tesla today, with Automotive News reporting that Germany's Umweltbundesamt (Federal Environmental Agency) has levied a $14 million fine against Tesla ""alleging its non-compliance under applicable laws relating to market participation notifications and take-back obligations with respect to end-of-life battery products required thereunder.""  Instead, Tesla stock is going up today, up 4.1% as of 10:20 a.m. EST, despite the fine. Why?Image source: Getty Images.First and foremost, $14 million is kind of like pocket change for Tesla, which did $8.8 billion in revenue last quarter alone, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Plus, Tesla may not even have to pay the fine. As Tesla explained, in fact it ""has continued to take back battery packs"" and the fine really relates ""primarily to administrative requirements"" on how it does this. In any case, Tesla is appealing the fine and, whether it wins or loses, does not expect to suffer ""a material adverse impact on our business.""  Plus, all of these facts were revealed in Tesla's 10-Q filing on Oct. 26, so while AN is just getting around to reporting them today, they were probably already baked into the stock's price before this.Meanwhile, in China, where Tesla now has a factory operating at full speed, news of a different sort is helping to lift shares of the electric-car maker. Reuters cites Chinese government sources predicting that sales of electric (and plug-in hybrid, and hydrogen fuel cell) cars will surge to account for 20% of all new car sales by 2025.If correct, this prediction would quadruple the current market share of electric car companies like Tesla in China, boosted by a ""green car quota system"" that will ""guide automakers to make more environmentally friendly vehicles.""Today, this news is already guiding investors to buy Tesla stock.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

45,"Nov 2, 2020 9:34AM EST","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf you believe that the United States is destined to turn to renewable power sources instead of burning its way through fossil fuels, Sunrun (NYSE:RUN) stock deserves some serious consideration.After a recent merger, Sunrun is undoubtedly the biggest name for consumers to turn for solar panels and alternative energy solutions. The potential market is huge. So is the opportunity for RUN stock.While Sunrun has come down from some recent highs, the stock is still up nearly 277% so far in 2020. Third-quarter earnings in early November could be a key point for RUN stock sentiment. So could the results of the presidential election.Sunrun recently completed its acquisition of Vivint Solar, in a $9.2 billion deal that was announced in July. The deal closed in early October, giving Vivint shareholders .55 shares of Sunrun stock for each share of Vivint stock.Sunrun will operate Vivint as a separate company in the near term before incorporating its operations into Sunrun. Sunrun owns 64% of the former Vivint, with its former shareholders owning the remaining 36% of the shares.Now that the deal is closed, Sunrun has more than 500,000 global customers and owns more than 3 gigawatts of solar energy capacity.Sunrun says that it is installing a new rooftop solar system nearly every two minutes. The company saw its customer base grow by 37% on a year-over-year basis in 2017; growth in 2018 was 31%, and growth in 2019 was 26%.As of August, Sunrun had customers in 22 U.S. states as well as Puerto Rico. But that’s really the tip of the iceberg.Even with its solid growth rate, Sunrun says that its market penetration is only 3%. Factoring in a compound annual growth rate of 15% over the next 10 years, Sunrun believes that it can reach 13% market penetration by 2029.The second quarter was not a good one for RUN stock. The company had one of its worst quarters for distributed energy deployment in two years. The slowdown was attributed to cutbacks in household spending from the novel coronavirus.For the second quarter, Sunrun reported a loss of $13.6 million, which equated to -11 cents per share. Revenue for the quarter also fell by 11% on a year-over-year basis to $181.3 million. The losses were led by product sales revenue and solar energy systems revenue, which fell by 33% on a year-over-year basis.But improvement is expected this quarter. When Sunrun reports earnings after the closing bell on Nov. 5, analysts are expecting revenue of $209.5 million. The company is also expected to turn a profit, with EPS of 2 cents.A year ago in the third quarter, Sunrun posted EPS of 23 cents per share, so the Covid-19 headwinds are far from over. It’s also notable that Sunrun has a history of consistently missing earnings expectations.Solar panel stocks have been doing particularly well this fall as the stock market begins hedging its bets on who will be occupying the Oval Office in January.President Donald Trump has been a champion of fossil fuels, promoting coal and exploration of oil and natural gas. But Democrat Joe Biden leads in the national polls as well as in key battleground states.Biden hasn’t endorsed the Green New Deal that the progressive wing of the Democratic party champions, but the policies of a Biden White House are seen to be more environmentally-friendly in promoting alternative energy sources. A Biden victory in November would continue to support solar panel stocks such as Sunrun.The company has been on an amazing run so far this year. Its Vivint acquisition gives it a market value of $22 billion. And there is a growing likelihood that the U.S. could have a more environmentally-friendly president in 2021.Even with the specter of competition from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in the residential solar panel market, the potential market for Sunrun is huge. Now that it’s absorbing Vivint, the company should be able to scale its operations and increase its profit margins as it accelerates growth.RUN stock has a ‘B’ rating in my Portfolio Grader, where it carries a buy recommendation.On the date of publication, Louis Navellier did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.The InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article had a long position in TSLA.

46,"Nov 2, 2020 8:01AM EST","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHydrogen fueler Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) proves markets are beginning to accommodate the world’s transition from fossil-fueled transportation to “greener” alternatives. It’s going to be a long and bumpy trip, however, as the volatility of PLUG stock demonstrates.Electric vehicles are the rage lately. Investors, lined up like excited Star Wars fans outside a theater, are pushing stocks in this emerging field. Never mind that some of these companies aren’t close to producing a vehicle.This enthusiasm is thanks to pioneering efforts of hybrid automakers and that rascal Elon Musk. Markets can now visualize battery-power vehicles being mainstream. And investors are supporting firms that will help provide needed infrastructure.All of these are baby steps, to be sure. No one promised change of this magnitude would come fast.The arc of alternatives to the internal-combustion engine goes back to when the federal government-imposed fuel economy standards. This rude nudge forced automakers to seriously consider miles per gallon as much as performance.Over time, vehicles became lighter and smaller, and mileage improved. Technology squeezed more miles and reduce pollution. Then hydrids arrived, bringing dependable 50 mpg and battery power to the traveling public.Full battery power, while perhaps the logical next step, isn’t the only option for clean transport. While hydrogen fuel cell technology is behind door No. 2, it’s not new to the party. George W. Bush, the 43rd president, touted its virtues, But folks weren’t in the mood – yet.Times have changed. Now, a growing number of people are strongly committed to sustainable investing. The long-term impact of ESG investing (environmental, social and governance) is helping hydrogen fuel cell development and companies like Plug Power get a foothold.Plug Power was launched in 1997 and went public two years later. The company, based in Latham, New York, grew through acquisitions and product expansion. Plug Power booked about $230 million in revenue in 2019 and has a market cap of about $5.6 billion.The company’s goal for 2024 is revenue of $1 billion.Plug Power says its products provide “cutting edge hydrogen fuel cell solutions across a broad spectrum of transportation, aerial and stationery applications.”Shares of PLUG stock are trading in at $14. In early October, the stock posted a 52-week high mark of $19.02. At the other end of that graph, PLUG bottomed at $2.53. PLUG stock can be as volatile as a teenager.The company is slated to release its third-quarter earnings on Nov. 5.Recently, InvestorPlace listed Plug Power sixth on a list of “10 Stocks to Ride the ESG Investing Wave.” In his article, my colleague Will Ashworth acknowledged Plug Power’s lofty valuation and its virtues, as well.“…I believe this is one of those stocks that will grow into its valuation,” Ashworth writes. “While it might seem expensive today, I’m confident its work across many industries will pay dividends in the future.”He adds that the company “has gone from speculative buy to plain-old all-around buy” with strong potential for the next decade.Strong performers join Plug Power on this list. Other companies include Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) and Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND).Only the most stubborn fans of oil companies will argue that clean energy is not the future. Instead, enlightened investors are discussing how long it will take to have an economy where sustainable and zero-emission energy sources are the norm.Plug Power deserves to be part of this timely conversation. The company is poised to be a major player in this evolving segment. It has put in more than a decade of work to get established and develop a brand. As a result, this hard work is beginning to, as they say, pay dividends.Now, the question is whether potential investors like what they see in Plug Power and willing to put money behind shares of PLUG stock.The answer is yes. PLUG stock should be included in a diversified portfolio that includes energy stocks. And at current prices, the company’s valuation is more reasonable.On the date of publication, Larry Sullivan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.Larry Sullivan is a veteran journalist in Florida who has covered banking and finance for several years.

47,"Nov 2, 2020 7:31AM EST","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn August, Peck (NASDAQ:PECK), a solar-focused contractor, agreed to acquire Sunworks (NASDAQ:SUNW) stock in an all-stock deal. Peck shareholders would own 63.46% of the combined entity, while SUNW shareholders would get the other 36.54%.Mergers are usually dull ordeals for regular investors. Investment banks take their massive cuts, hedge funds nibble at the edges for arbitrage opportunities, and individual investors get a note from their brokerage that one of their stock tickers changed at some point two weeks ago.But the Sunworks deal is different. And, as a solar investor, I NEED you to pay attention.Here’s why.Since the two companies announced the deal, the typically smooth merger process has gotten upended by “electric vehicle mania,” a mad dash to invest in any company that looks like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).On Sept. 24, SPI Energy (NASDAQ:SPI) announced plans to enter the electric vehicle space. As rumors swirled, investors targeted similar-sounding Sunworks as another potential electric vehicle play. Shares of the solar panel contractor jumped 275% on hopes it would create an EV battery.The duller sounding Peck Company, on the other hand, rose by just 70% despite its similar affiliation. Yet, the terms of the SUNW/PECK deal haven’t changed – Sunworks will still get 0.185171 shares of the combined entity.That means SUNW stock has become wildly overpriced. Any investor buying high-priced Sunworks today will have their shares converted into cheaper PECK stock once the merger closes in Q4. In other words, investors looking to cash in on the solar craze should buy Peck instead.I know this might seem boring, but it’s critical to understand what merger arbitrage means for SUNW stock. It’s the difference between having 56% of your investment melt away or getting 130% in “free money” once (or if) the PECK/SUNW merger closes.In a merger, the acquiring company (buyer) typically offers either its shares, cash, or a combination of both to the acquired company (target). Offer a high enough price tag, and TargetCo’s shareholders generally say “yes.”All cash deals. Of the three options, all-cash deals are the easiest to understand. An acquiring company might offer $100 per share to buy TargetCo, which would immediately push its shares $100. The target might trade for slightly less (i.e., $98) if investors don’t believe the deal will go through. Or it could sell for more (i.e., $105) if investors believe a better deal will come along. But it will eventually settle at $100 once both boards agree to the terms and the merger goes through.Share-based deals. Share-based transactions are a little harder to understand but follow the same principle. Let’s say an acquiring company offers 30% of its shares to the target. If the buyer’s total share value is $70 million, the target’s total share value should settle around $30 million (i.e., 30% of the combined 30 + 70 = $100 million entity). And because share prices are linked, one stock’s rise tends to push up the other.When management announced the PECK/SUNW deal, their share values largely met these guidelines. PECK closed at $4.10 on Aug. 11, while Sunworks closed at 72 cents. The agreed-upon exchange rate of 0.185171 meant that each SUNW stock valued PECK at 0.72 / 0.185171 = $3.88/share, a minor 6% difference.But then something happened this fall: SUNW stock rocketed in value as investors rushed into solar stocks. (Perhaps they didn’t realize that PECK is also a solar company). Today, SUNW is valued at $3.05, which suggests PECK should be worth 3.05 / 0.185171 = $15.22. However, PECK is worth just $6.56 today, despite 70% of its business coming from installing solar panels. That’s a gaping hole of $8.66 per share.In theory, that means regular Joe investors could potentially buy PECK, short SUN, and earn $8.66/share in profit. That’s how merger arbitrage hedge funds make a living. (Merger arbitrage hedge funds have almost certainly stayed away since the PECK/SUNW deal comes to just $28 million, a drop in the bucket for most hedge funds).And that leaves regular investors a grand entrance into a usually exclusive world of “merger-arb.”So, what could go wrong? Firstly, Sunworks could still call off the deal. The $375,000 termination fee is a drop in the bucket compared to the current $28 million mispricing of SUNW stock. Secondly, SUNW shares are expensive to short. Interactive Brokers, a trading platform, quotes a 42.38% fee rate for shorted shares.And finally, more investor mania could push SUNW stock up even further, creating massive short-term losses for those who don’t correctly hedge their short positions.Those three reasons make SUNW stock somewhat unattractive to short. To simplify the process, investors looking to buy into solar contractors should buy PECK stock outright. The second-generation family company has a long history of profits and offers a way to buy SUNW stock for cheap.PECK isn’t perfect either. For instance, it had trouble managing profitability through its IPO – EBITDA decreased 10.7% in 2019 as the company moved to acquire projects at the “notice to proceed” phase. Its localized team will also need to adjust to working nationally with SUNW’s sprawling operations.But it’s far and away more profitable than SUNW, despite working in the same contracting industry. It’s also in an incredibly fast-growing space of solar panels. The EIA expects renewables to make up over half of all power generation by 2042, with solar accounting for almost half. That makes PECK a far better buy than SUNW, in both price and operations.Solar investors: get all hands on deck. PECK has a long way up to go.On the date of publication, Tom Yeung did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Tom Yeung, CFA, is a registered investment advisor on a mission to bring simplicity to the world of investing.The post Sunworks Could Win, But Buy Its Acquisition Partner Peck Instead appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/sunworks-could-win-but-buy-its-acquisition-partner-peck-instead-2020-11-02

48,"Nov 2, 2020 6:48AM EST","The higher one climbs, the harder one falls. Such is the fate for stocks that are trading at ridiculously high price-to-earnings ratios. This is especially the case in the context of the ongoing market sell-off, where the S&P 500 has now declined 8.3% from all-time highs. These three companies -- an electric vehicle (EV) maker, a videoconferencing leader, and a struggling biotech -- already have their growth potential maxed out in their stock prices, if not more. Today, let's look at why investors should be in no hurry to buy their dips. Image source: Getty Images.Nowadays, many investors view Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) as a revolutionary company at the forefront of innovation in the EV industry. Its financials seem to suggest so as well. In its third-quarter update, the company said its sales increased by 45% compared with last year, to $8.7 billion. As its revenue increased, so did its profits. Tesla's gross margin came in at 23.5% versus 18.9% in Q3 2019. And the company more than tripled its free cash flow from last year to $1.3 billion. During the quarter, it produced over 145,000 vehicles and delivered about the same amount. The problem with Tesla lies not in its business model nor the quality of its vehicles, but in its valuation. Right now, the stock is trading for an incredible 14 times sales and 825 times earnings. Tesla's $389 billion market cap is now bigger than the world's top five automakers combined. Betting on the EV manufacturer's potential is a lucrative idea, but now is simply not the time to do it. Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ: ZM) has undoubtedly become one of the biggest beneficiaries of the coronavirus pandemic by providing an essential videoconferencing service to employees, professors, students, and pretty much everyone else. During the second quarter of its fiscal 2021, its revenue grew by 355% year over year to $663.5 million. Earnings increased more than 30-fold to $0.63 per share. There are now 370,200 businesses with at least 10 employees using Zoom's platform, 458% growth since the second quarter of 2020. Similar to Tesla, Zoom has a huge valuation problem despite its fantastic underlying business. The stock trades for an unbelievable 113 times price-to-sales and a P/E of 661. Even tiny risk factors, such as a coronavirus vaccine bringing people back to the workplace or school and causing videoconferences to decline, could poke holes in Zoom stock's rapid growth. For those who are looking to get into tech stocks, I'd recommend ones that trade for more reasonable prices. Just a year ago, Amarin (NASDAQ: AMRN) was on track to become a multibillion-dollar biotech after the Food and Drug Administration approved its fish-oil pill Vascepa for reducing cardiovascular risk in patients. Last year, the drug rang up $430 million in sales, an 87% increase over 2018. But that dream ended in a rude awakening in March, when a Nevada District Court Judge ruled U.S. patents covering Vascepa were invalid because the drug was too obvious to be considered a novel invention. In September, the company lost an appeal to the ruling. Patents are integral to a biotech's revenue potential since they protect generic competitors from entering the market for 20 years after filing. The price of branded oral medicines typically declines by 80% within five years after losing their patent protection. As a result, Amarin's current 8.5 P/E may appear to be very cheap based on historical financials. But the stock seems incredibly overvalued given that it could lose more than three-quarters of its revenue in a short period of time. There are already three copycat drugs on the market competing with Vascepa. Despite small-cap biotechs' high-growth potential, investing in their stocks is about as risky as it gets. 10 stocks we like better than AmarinWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

49,"Nov 1, 2020 9:00AM EST","By David Randall and Svea Herbst-BaylissNEW YORK, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Some investors are betting the technology and communications stocks that drove a massive rebound in U.S. markets this year will face a tougher slog in coming months, no matter whether Republican President Donald Trump or Democratic challenger Joe Biden wins Tuesday's election. Betting against big technology has been a risky proposition over the last decade, as stocks like Amazon, Google and Netflix have shot higher at the expense of so-called value and cyclical stocks such as banks and energy companies.Recently, however, some fund managers say they are growing alarmed by what they see as a consensus in Washington to tighten regulations, and prospects that another large stimulus bill would bolster a rotation out of tech and into other sectors including economically sensitive value stocks.""There will be a shift and it is starting, but it will take time,"" said Max Gokhman, head of asset allocation at Pacific Life Fund Advisors, which cut its exposure to large-cap tech in September to neutral from overweight. Should Biden win as polls suggest, technology companies could face higher tax rates and tax-motivated selling as well as increased regulation, investors said.Both Trump and Biden have criticized large tech companies but stopped short of explicitly calling for them to be broken up. Trump has said “there is something going on in terms of monopoly” when asked about big tech firms.Apple Inc AAPL.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, Facebook Inc FB.O, and Google-parent Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O now make up approximately 23% of the total weight of the S&P 500, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, giving their gyrations an outsized impact on broader markets.Hedge fund manager David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital, a longtime tech bear, told clients in a letter this week that tech stocks were in the middle of an “enormous bubble” that popped when the S&P 500 hit its record high on Sept. 2, 2020. Technology stocks tumbled in the past week's selloff, though earnings results from companies like Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon have shown how the tech giants expanded their businesses this year.""It has become more difficult for mega-cap tech to surprise on the upside,"" analysts at UBS Global Wealth Management said in a note Friday.Some investors pointed to recent hearings in Washington as a sign that increased regulations will come to the sector no matter which party takes control in Washington.The Justice Department’s lawsuit against Google in late October marked the first time the U.S. government has cracked down on a major tech company since it sued Microsoft Corp MSFT.O for anti-competitive practices in 1998.""This may be the only bi-partisan issue out there,"" Pacific Life's Gokhman said.An expected $2 trillion stimulus package by Biden, who leads Trump in national polls by 10 percentage points, could enhance the appeal of out-of-favor stocks like construction equipment and materials companies, investors said.A shift to value stocks ""is increasingly likely over the next 12 months,"" said Eduardo Costa, who runs hedge fund Calixto Global Investors, LP. Calixto, which invests largely in technology, media, and telecom stocks, has returned 30% since January, an investor said.Potentially higher taxes under a Biden administration are another worry. Biden has proposed increasing the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%, potentially weighing on companies' earnings. A separate proposal to tax capital gains and dividends as ordinary income could prompt some investors to sell winners in order to lock in lower tax rates, analysts said.Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist at Wells Fargo Asset Management, said his firm has been underweighting the Nasdaq Composite and is moving more of its portfolios into cyclical stocks with more compelling valuations, especially industrials.""We've done some scenario analysis and thinking through various permutations of who controls Congress and the White House and our general view is that it might not matter all that much,"" he said.(Reporting by David Randall and Svea Herbst-Bayliss; Editing by David Gregorio)((David.Randall@thomsonreuters.com; 646-223-6607; Reuters Messaging: david.randall.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/wall-st-week-ahead-big-tech-stocks-may-face-post-election-headwinds-no-matter-who-wins-0

50,"Oct 31, 2020 9:03AM EDT","In this segment from Fool Live, Senior Consumer Goods & Industrials Specialist Asit Sharma and senior technology specialist Daniel Sparks put the spotlight on Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) improved bottom line.The electric-car maker has gone from burning through huge sums of cash to generating well over $1 billion of free cash flow in a single quarter. As the automaker continues to scale its business, Tesla could generate massive profits in the years ahead.In this video, Daniel takes a closer stock at Tesla's free cash flow and what it means for the stock's valuation.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.See the 10 stocks *Stock Advisor returns as of October 20, 2020 Asit Sharma: So in terms of the profit on the books and the cash flow, they've had a few quarters here, and I'm not sure that these are actually sequential -- you can remind me -- but it seems like they're hitting a scale where they're able to cross that chasm and show some net income on the books, show some positive operating cash flow. Any thoughts on that?Daniel Sparks: Yeah, I meant to highlight that, as well. I got carried away in the demand story there, but they are, they really have shown they can be consistently profitable. So $0.76 per share and a non-GAAP basis is $0.27 per share on a GAAP basis, the analyst estimate was around $0.50 cents, I think at $0.55 cents (non-GAAP) or so. Seventy-six cents was up 105% year over year, but free cash flow, which is, I think, at a fast-growing company that's very capital-intensive, gives you more insight into the way the business is scaling. They brought in $1.4 billion in a single quarter. Going into this quarter, the trailing 12-month free cash flow was $800 million. It's enormous. The transformation here is definitely real. I think that people who doubted Tesla, there might have been a lot of good reasons for their doubts a few years ago. But I think the story has changed drastically because they've hit a critical point. I think that investors should really revisit the valuation. I mean, $1.4 billion in a single quarter -- you push that out four quarters and you're talking, they could substantiate a pretty wild valuation, especially with their growth rates.Daniel Sparks has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

51,"Oct 31, 2020 8:31AM EDT","We're counting down to Nov. 3. The election between Donald Trump and Joe Biden is one of the most anticipated elections in modern history. The only thing that holds more sway in the news is the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. With a ton of votes already in early, and polls opening Tuesday morning, just what does an election do to the stock market?According to analysts at U.S. Bank, a division of U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB), equity and bond markets tend to underperform their typical 12-month trends during the year of a general election. It's not hard to see why when you consider all the noise. Every single news source reports evolving commentary daily. Within that commentary, citizens (including investors) are flooded with a lot to think about. Will a liberal government sway the market with tighter regulations and taxes on industries? Will four more years of tough trade stances from the Trump administration weigh on international dealings? Image source: Getty Images.Following an election year, U.S. Bank noted, stock markets have a habit of closing slightly lower, while bond markets outperform. Perhaps most interesting is that the party taking office doesn't have a large impact on the trends; the bigger factor is whether there is a change in who is president. Specifically, stock market returns average around 6.5% if an incumbent party maintains hold of the presidency, or if the president is reelected. If the party changes, markets average gains of around 5%. Jurrien Timmer, Fidelity Investments' director of global macro for their global asset allocation division, noted that the first two years of a presidential term are mostly associated with below-average returns, while the second two years tend to outperform. But this has been a strange year, with a plethora of influences on the market and economy that has spurred a large variant from the norm. Going into election week, 2020 has basically been a wash for the the market, as COVID-19 sent the S&P 500 spiraling in the spring. The index has largely recovered, but the majority of the strength has come from tech companies, with access to the needs of remote working and social distancing. There are so many working parts to an economy that it's hard to give too much credit to one person. In many ways, the Federal Reserve and Congress have far more influence on the economy than the President does. Congress can drive fiscal spending, and the Fed holds control over credit markets and liquidity.Very rarely has a shift in party governance meant catastrophic results for the economy or security markets. A notable exception might be the failure of Herbert Hoover, and the government at that time, to act during the crash of 1929 and subsequent Great Depression. But the cause of that crash was not the government. The culprit was good ol' speculation run amok, with leveraged debt to buy securities that were inflated. Those types of trends are what investors should watch out for. Look at the market today. You'll find that some of the best performing stocks this year command pretty big premiums that are not in conjunction with the actual earnings of the company. The P/E ratio of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) should influence your decisions far more than whether or not the President supports electric cars. If you're making long-term investment decisions based on an elected official who could be around for eight years at most, you're already thinking too small. Throughout the last 50 years, in which we have had nine Presidents, the S&P 500 has grown by over 4,000%. Again, certain industries can flourish or suffer based around certain policies, but the broader market has always muscled on.Traders might be able to take advantage of volatility during a presidential election, but for the average investor, it doesn't pay to take part in that speculation. Maintaining a well-thought-out, diversified portfolio that isn't focused on the short term is still the intelligent way to play the game.I'll extend an olive branch to those that are heavily engaged in the impact that the election could, or could not, have on markets.A sector that could see a wild ride is healthcare. The debate over private healthcare systems and government funded plans is an ongoing fight between Democrats and Republicans. It's no secret that the two parties don't agree on what they want when it comes to our nation's healthcare system. That ongoing debate and uncertainty could scare investors in companies like UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) or Humana (NYSE: HUM). Joe Biden's stance on healthcare includes a call for a public option. No matter how you slice it, that creates competition for private sector insurance companies.President Donald Trump supports replacing Obamacare with a new plan. There hasn't been a ton of information provided on what he wants exactly, but it includes the desire to lower drug costs and drive down premiums. That puts pressure on healthcare stocks as well.As we've learned time and again, nothing is easily achieved when it comes to actually creating the legislation. Nevertheless, speculation and fear could very easily run amok within the healthcare sector. If the supreme court does take up the issue, the matter will only get more volatile.Over the course of time, no election has resulted in permanent damage to the stock market. The S&P 500 has increased through time, regardless of the who is in the White House. There can of course be short term volatility, and certain policies can have detrimental implications for certain industries, or specific companies. That's why it will never backfire to stick to the fundamentals of diversification and long-term thinking.Make sure you think rather than simply buying something because Joe Biden or Donald Trump won. Justify it with analysis. As pointed out, it might be best to go light on healthcare stocks. Regardless, investing in a diversified portfolio, with an emphasis on long-term performance, can withstand election volatility. 10 stocks we like better than WalmartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

52,"Oct 31, 2020 7:24AM EDT","After more than a year of campaigning and seemingly millions of robocalls, the United States goes to the polls this Tuesday.Elections, as they say, have consequences, and investors understandably are focused on what happens on Tuesday and what it will mean for their portfolios.To be clear, we at The Motley Fool advocate for investing for the long-term and picking stocks that will generate strong returns for much longer than one presidential cycle.But for those looking for investment ideas tied to the upcoming election, here's why we believe ManTech International (NASDAQ: MANT), Ford Motor (NYSE: F), and Huntington Ingalls Industries (NYSE: HII) are three stocks to buy.Image source: Getty Images.Lou Whiteman (ManTech): Defense stocks have underperformed this year, largely because of election concerns. The SPADE Defense Index is off 21% year to date, losing to the S&P 500 by 20 percentage points. Government services companies, specialists that focus on running IT systems and assuming other outsourced tasks, have done far worse than more traditional defense contractors that build fighters, tanks, and ships.The stocks are down because the last time there was gridlock in Washington it led to sequestration, which cut Pentagon spending. This time around it could be worse due to the large unexpected outlays the government has paid to fight COVID-19, leaving Washington with only a limited amount to spend.I think the concerns are overdone, as both presidential candidates have committed to defense spending. And while government services did feel the bulk of the pain last decade when cuts happened, that neglect helped contribute to IT snafus including the Edward Snowden incident. Officials tend to overcorrect after mistakes, and given the recent emphasis on nation state hacking and IT security I believe it is unlikely the government's current tech modernization is derailed this time around.The Pentagon also doesn't have the same amount of foreign military activity to fund this time.There are a handful of beaten-down government IT companies I think are poised to outperform, but ManTech is my top pick because it offers a lot of ways to win. Its top-secret-heavy portfolio should hold up better than more-commoditized IT providers.ManTech also has a strong balance sheet and should be able to do deals to take advantage of valuation discounts due to these worries. And the company, with an enterprise value of $3.19 billion and a well-performing business, would be an enticing mid-sized target for some of the larger companies in the business.Company co-founder George Pedersen ran ManTech for five decades, and during that time the assumption was ManTech was not for sale. But Pedersen gave up the CEO role in 2018 and in September transitioned from executive chairman of the board to chairman emeritus.ManTech doesn't need to be acquired for investors to win, but I like the number of different ways for the stock to propel higher.John Rosevear (Ford Motor Company): Ford's stock has been sinking for years now, along with, it must be said, its profit margins. While General Motors has jumped from strength to strength, and Tesla has done the Tesla thing, Ford has looked, well, low on gas.So why buy Ford now? Things are looking up.New CEO Jim Farley represents a big change from his predecessor, the now-retired Jim Hackett. While the professorial Hackett was admired inside Ford, he often had trouble communicating his vision for the company to people outside -- particularly auto investors and Wall Street analysts. Not surprisingly, investors looked elsewhere. Ford's all-new 2021 F-150 is just one of several important new products due over the next few quarters. It'll be out by the end of 2020. Image source: Ford Motor Company.But that is changing -- in fact, it has already changed. Farley, a longtime Ford executive who took over the top job on Oct. 1, made a strong positive impression during Wednesday's earnings call. Among other things, Farley spoke clearly about his near-term vision for Ford, and promised to present a comprehensive update on the company's longer-term strategy next spring.Ford's third-quarter results were surprisingly strong, but it's still a big automaker in a recession, and sales are likely to be only so-so until the COVID-19 pandemic recedes. That said, recessions can be a great time to buy cyclical stocks like automakers, as auto sales tend to be a leading indicator -- they, and automakers' profits, tend to jump early in economic recoveries.I don't know when this recession is going to end, of course. But I do know that Ford, with plenty of cash in the bank and a slew of new products on the way over the next few quarters, is likely to be in a great position to benefit when the economy turns back up. I think it's a good bet that investors holding Ford stock (I'm one) will benefit as well.Rich Smith (Huntington Ingalls): For four long years, President Donald Trump has been promising to build a 355-ship Navy for America. As his second term winds down, though, the number of ships on the Navy's ""Battle Forces"" register remains below 300 -- and only 253 of those are active in commission. Clearly, we still have a ways to go before America's Navy is up to snuff, and that means that whoever wins the White House next week, the U.S. Navy is going to have to keep buying warships.And that's good news for Huntington Ingalls.One of only two or three companies remaining that are capable of building large warships for the Navy (General Dynamics and sometimes Lockheed Martin are the two others), Huntington Ingalls' fortunes are inextricably tied to the Navy's expansion plans -- and a Navy that needs to grow by another 40%, I'd argue, is a Navy that will be expanding for years, no matter who sits in the Oval Office. Even assuming I'm right about that, though, why choose to invest in Huntington Ingalls instead of General Dynamics or Lockheed Martin?Mainly, I base my decision on valuation. At 11.5 times trailing earnings, Huntington Ingalls stock is more of a bargain than General Dynamics (12.1 times earnings), and it's much cheaper than Lockheed Martin (15.6 times). The disparity in valuations gets even clearer when you compare stock prices to sales. Here, Lockheed Martin is once again the most expensive stock of the group, selling for a price-to-sales ratio of 1.6. General Dynamics looks significantly better at just a little over one times sales -- very close to the usual, historical average valuations for defense stocks.At a valuation of less than 0.7 times sales, however, Huntington Ingalls is far and away the cheapest defense stock of the group -- and my favorite to outperform the market regardless of who wins Election 2020.10 stocks we like better than FordWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

53,"Oct 31, 2020 5:51AM EDT","Forget ghouls and goblins -- if you want to scare an investor, just show them a five-week chart of the benchmark S&P 500 between Feb. 19 and March 23. The S&P 500's 34% loss in roughly one month during the first quarter marks the fastest bear market decline in history.Of course, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and record-setting volatility in the stock market aren't the only frights investors may have to cope with in the near term. A trio of exceptionally popular stocks currently looks more like trick than treat. Think twice before buying into these companies.Image source: Getty Images.Cue the chorus of boos, but investors should be highly skeptical of electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA).As an investor, I can be highly skeptical of a company and still give credit where it's due. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has successfully achieved what hasn't been done in over five decades: creating a new car company from the ground up and reaching mass production. EVs are unquestionably the future of the automotive industry, and Tesla has been on the leading edge of EV and battery technology innovation.But Tesla is also tricking its shareholders into believing it's firing on all cylinders (pardon the combustible engine pun). Though Tesla has reported five consecutive quarterly profits, four were solely the result of selling regulatory credits. In each of the past four quarters, Tesla has sold $133 million, $354 million, $428 million, and $397 million in regulatory credits, while generating generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income of $105 million, $16 million, $104 million, and $331 million. Without these regulatory credits, Tesla isn't profitable on a GAAP basis. There are only so many credits Tesla can sell, which leads me to believe that future quarters won't have this tricky (but perfectly legal) boost to GAAP earnings. Tesla investors also have to cope with the ups and downs of having Elon Musk as CEO. Though undoubtedly a visionary, he's also a bit of a loose cannon. He's been in hot water with the Securities and Exchange Commission more than once. He also has a long history of overpromising on new technology, at least concerning when new products or software will debut.Tesla has been a massive treat for long-term shareholders, but looks to be more of a trick at its current valuation.Image source: Getty Images.Another company that looks great but becomes questionable under scrutiny is biotech stock Inovio Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: INO).Inovio has been on fire in 2020 given that it's one of roughly a dozen publicly traded drug developers testing a COVID-19 vaccine. The COVID-19 pandemic offers multibillion-dollar sales potential for biotech and pharmaceutical companies. In a phase 1 trial, Inovio's experimental INO-4800 vaccine elicited an immune response in 94% of patients. Inovio is more trick than treat at this point thanks to two factors.First, the Food and Drug Administration has put the company's phase 2/3 clinical trial on partial hold. There are no safety concerns, but the regulatory agency has questions regarding INO-4800 and its accompanying Cellectra delivery device that Inovio will need to answer before the study can proceed. The longer Inovio's experimental therapy remains on hold, the further it falls behind competing therapies. Second, Inovio hasn't exactly shown investors much over the past four decades. While it's been able to raise cash through common stock offerings and U.S. government grants, it doesn't have a single approved therapy to show for it. Even if Inovio somehow trumps its poor drug development track record and brings a vaccine to market, it's unlikely to be the only drugmaker providing a COVID-19 vaccine.At this point, the Inovio growth story looks to be all hype.Image source: Getty Images.Young investors absolutely love marijuana stocks, and Canadian licensed producer Aurora Cannabis (NYSE: ACB) often tops the list. It's easy to like the pot industry with sales estimates for legalized weed soaring throughout North America. Still, it's important to realize that not every company is going to be a winner in this space.By the midpoint of 2019, Aurora seemed to have it all. The company had peak annual output potential of more than 650,000 kilos with access to two dozen countries outside its home market of Canada. But since the midpoint of 2019, it's closed five of its smaller cultivation facilities, halted construction on two of its largest projects to conserve cash, and sold a separate 1-million-square-foot greenhouse that it never retrofit for pot production. It's also delivered very little in the way of international sales.What has Aurora given shareholders? The wrong kind of buzz. In fiscal 2020, the company wrote down more than $2.8 billion Canadian, much of which was tied to its grossly overpriced acquisitions. Despite these huge losses, a recent SEDAR filing showed that the company's executives qualified for a healthy pay raise and bonus bump in the June-ended year.Furthermore, Aurora Cannabis can't stop burning through its cash on hand and diluting its shareholders. The company recently completed a $250 million (that's U.S.) at-the-market offering and announced another $500 million ATM offering this week. This comes after Aurora's outstanding share count ballooned from about 1.3 million in June 2014 to 160.7 million as of October 2020. Though marijuana should be a high-growth industry this decade, Aurora Cannabis isn't the stock to own in this space.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In addition, Daniel details how the electric-car maker's vehicle production rates and deliveries are surging.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.See the 10 stocks *Stock Advisor returns as of October 20, 2020 Transcript:Daniel Sparks: I won't bore you, just jump into the numbers. What we did know going into the report was we knew it was going to be a big quarter, deliveries were up sharply. They had already announced that deliveries were up 43 percent year-over-year and 53 percent sequentially -- record quarterly deliveries. They had a full recovery from their factory shutdowns during the second quarter. I glanced over at the report and revenue was expected to be up about 31 percent year-over-year. Instead, it was up 39 percent year-over-year. I haven't had too much time to look into how much of that has to do with regulatory credits but I think that just from a quick glance that it's probably quite a bit because regulatory sold credits were 397 million compared to 134 million in the year-ago quarter. But that's still a small chunk of the total revenues, which were $8.8 billion.Then can you just believe that? $8.8 billion in a single quarter? I've been covering this company a long time. That's huge compared to five years ago.Then another thing I wanted to look for quickly was signs of how demand is fairing because really this is a growth story and investors want to check on that growth story every quarter. They did say in the outlook section of their report that they still have the capacity installed to produce and deliver 500,000 vehicles this year but they said, ""achieving this goal has become more difficult. Delivering half a million vehicles in 2020 remains our target.""Now just some background on that. I mean, they've had to pump out a lot of deliveries in the final two quarters, to even have a shot. Going into 2020, their guidance was 500,000 vehicles or more, but then the factory shutdown put them back on that target -- and then they brought that guidance back after the factory reopened. It's still an ambitious target and we're talking that would be up from 368,000 vehicles last year, so wild growth in the face of the challenges they've had this year.But what's interesting is they say, this is what's key to me in the report, is they highlight that demand must be fine because it's not whether or not they're going have enough demand to do 500,000 vehicles, it has only to do with production. I'm just going to read them right here from this report.Achieving this target depends primarily on quarter-over-quarter increases and Model Y and Shanghai production, as well as further improvements in logistics and delivery efficiency at higher volume levels.Two bottlenecks there: production and our ability to get the vehicles in the hands of customers. No mention of demand being an issue. This has always been my thesis that demand grows in proportion to deliveries because of the word of mouth of the vehicle and, of course, they don't have advertising, so that makes sense and it looks like that thesis continues to play out.Daniel Sparks has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

55,"Oct 30, 2020 5:10PM EDT","By David Randall and Svea Herbst-BaylissNEW YORK, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Some investors are betting the technology and communications stocks that drove a massive rebound in U.S. markets this year will face a tougher slog in coming months, no matter whether Republican President Donald Trump or Democratic challenger Joe Biden wins Tuesday's election. Betting against big technology has been a risky proposition over the last decade, as stocks like Amazon, Google and Netflix have shot higher at the expense of so-called value and cyclical stocks such as banks and energy companies.Recently, however, some fund managers say they are growing alarmed by what they see as a consensus in Washington to tighten regulations, and prospects that another large stimulus bill would bolster a rotation out of tech and into other sectors including economically sensitive value stocks.""There will be a shift and it is starting, but it will take time,"" said Max Gokhman, head of asset allocation at Pacific Life Fund Advisors, which cut its exposure to large-cap tech in September to neutral from overweight. Should Biden win as polls suggest, technology companies could face higher tax rates and tax-motivated selling as well as increased regulation, investors said.Both Trump and Biden have criticized large tech companies but stopped short of explicitly calling for them to be broken up. Trump has said “there is something going on in terms of monopoly” when asked about big tech firms.Apple Inc AAPL.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, Facebook Inc FB.O, and Google-parent Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O now make up approximately 23% of the total weight of the S&P 500, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, giving their gyrations an outsized impact on broader markets.Hedge fund manager David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital, a longtime tech bear, told clients in a letter this week that tech stocks were in the middle of an “enormous bubble” that popped when the S&P 500 hit its record high on Sept. 2, 2020. Technology stocks tumbled in the past week's selloff, though earnings results from companies like Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon have shown how the tech giants expanded their businesses this year.""It has become more difficult for mega-cap tech to surprise on the upside,"" analysts at UBS Global Wealth Management said in a note Friday.Some investors pointed to recent hearings in Washington as a sign that increased regulations will come to the sector no matter which party takes control in Washington.The Justice Department’s lawsuit against Google in late October marked the first time the U.S. government has cracked down on a major tech company since it sued Microsoft Corp MSFT.O for anti-competitive practices in 1998.""This may be the only bi-partisan issue out there,"" Pacific Life's Gokhman said.An expected $2 trillion stimulus package by Biden, who leads Trump in national polls by 10 percentage points, could enhance the appeal of out-of-favor stocks like construction equipment and materials companies, investors said.A shift to value stocks ""is increasingly likely over the next 12 months,"" said Eduardo Costa, who runs hedge fund Calixto Global Investors, LP. Calixto, which invests largely in technology, media, and telecom stocks, has returned 30% since January, an investor said.Potentially higher taxes under a Biden administration are another worry. Biden has proposed increasing the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%, potentially weighing on companies' earnings. A separate proposal to tax capital gains and dividends as ordinary income could prompt some investors to sell winners in order to lock in lower tax rates, analysts said.Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist at Wells Fargo Asset Management, said his firm has been underweighting the Nasdaq Composite and is moving more of its portfolios into cyclical stocks with more compelling valuations, especially industrials.""We've done some scenario analysis and thinking through various permutations of who controls Congress and the White House and our general view is that it might not matter all that much,"" he said.(Reporting by David Randall and Svea Herbst-Bayliss; Editing by David Gregorio)((David.Randall@thomsonreuters.com; 646-223-6607; Reuters Messaging: david.randall.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/wall-st-week-ahead-big-tech-stocks-may-face-post-election-headwinds-no-matter-who-wins

56,"Oct 30, 2020 4:05PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) isn’t giving the bears what they want, which is a collapse into oblivion. And while TSLA stock has been volatile, the past year has really been one giant victory lap for the bulls. At its highs, Tesla stock commanded a market capitalization in excess of $450 billion. That made it one of the largest stocks in the entire market. Think about that for a minute: The company that seemingly everyone hated became one of the most valuable entities in the country.From its low on Aug. 11 to its high on Sept. 1, TSLA stock surged more than 70%. Admittedly, that was a bit exuberant — particularly given its market cap at that point — as the rally was being driven by momentum ahead of its stock split.However, the latest quarter highlights why the stock has had momentum.Earlier this month on Oct. 2, Tesla reported third-quarter deliveries of 139,300 vehicles. More than 124,000 of those vehicles were the Model 3 or Model Y. This result was able to top consensus Wall Street expectations of 137,000 and crushed its previous deliveries record of 112,000.A few weeks later, the company impressed again. Non-GAAP earnings of 76 cents per share beat estimates by 16 cents. On a GAAP basis, Tesla also turned in a profitable quarter, its fifth straight quarterly net income.Additionally, revenue of $8.77 billion grew almost 40% year over year and beat estimates by a good amount. Can we talk about that for a minute? At a time where the global economy is getting thrashed, Tesla found a way to generate 40% revenue growth and churn out record deliveries.Talk about impressive.Even better, automotive margins climbed to 27.7% in the quarter. That was up from 25.4% sequentially and easily beat analysts’ expectations of 24.1%. Versus the same quarter a year ago, Tesla’s automotive gross margins increased significantly from 22.8%.We’ve talked about deliveries and vehicles, but notice that I haven’t yet called Tesla an automaker. That’s because I consider Tesla a tech company with an automotive business unit. That’s as Tesla continues to make progress on the autonomous driving front and also has an energy unit. Moreover, Tesla continues to deploy systems as it works on its solar roof approach. In fact, the company said, (bold emphasis added):“Our energy storage business reached record deployments of 759 MWh in Q3. Megapack production continued to ramp at Gigafactory Nevada as production volumes more than doubled in Q3. Powerwall demand remains strong and is growing, particularly as our solar business grows as many customers include a Powerwall with their solar installation. Additionally, we are seeing accelerating interest in Powerwall as concerns with grid stability grow, particularly in California. We continue to believe that the energy business will ultimately be as large as our vehicle business.“You see, the energy unit of Tesla has huge potential as consumers, municipalities, states and entire countries start to alter the way they view energy consumption. The world is making an enormous shift to green energy, and Tesla is in prime position to leverage that shift. However, the company is also properly preparing for the future — like any great company with a visionary CEO. And despite doubts aplenty regarding Gigafactory 3 in Shanghai, the factory went up in impressive time. Now, Tesla is working on factories in Germany and Texas, as it gears up for the Cybertruck, Roadster and Semi. Regarding the German factory, Tesla expects production to start next year. To get these jobs done, Tesla raised an additional $5 billion in cash in September. Some investors may not like the dilution, but honestly, I love it. A company like Tesla needs capital, particularly when liquidity was the bears’ strongest argument. And with CEO Elon Musk owning tons of the stock and plenty of long-term investors in the name, why not raise funds?In fact, Bank of America analysts argue that Tesla should raise even more capital. Last quarter, it ended with more than $14.5 billion in cash and equivalents and had positive operating cash flow. Last but not least, volatility is our friend. TSLA stock goes through its ebbs and flows — like any other stock. It will not go up forever, so enjoy the sunshine as it bakes down upon us. After spending a few years in a sideways trading pattern, Tesla stock is up more than 500% in the past year. Amid that pattern, bulls had plenty of days to rejoice and plenty of days spent tending their wounds. Now, they need to remember that the painful stretches are an opportunity to buy. Those who bought the deep dips in TSLA stock have reaped handsome rewards. And I don’t expect that to change going forward. On the date of publication, neither Matt McCall nor the InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article held (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.The post Record Deliveries and Earnings Make Tesla Stock One to Buy appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/record-deliveries-and-earnings-make-tesla-stock-one-to-buy-2020-10-30

57,"Oct 30, 2020 1:16PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLordstown Motors (NASDAQ:RIDE), housed in a former General Motors (NYSE:GM) assembly plant, has begun trading with a market capitalization of $460 million. RIDE stock opened Oct. 29 at about $14.50 per share. GM is backing the start-up, which merged with a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) called DiamondPeak to go public this week.It’s all part of a frenzy of electric-car financing, as investors continue to reject the old gas-powered giants and search for someone who might compete with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) went public earlier and is now part-owned by GM. A company called Fisker is also trying to go public through a SPAC.Lordstown has a design for an electric truck that looks more like a standard model than the Tesla Cybertruck, which is made out of thick sheet metal that doesn’t bend easily.The plan is to get the new truck into production by next September. Meanwhile a prototype is doing stunts against Ford (NYSE:F) F-150s.CEO Steve Burns says that what will distinguish his truck, called the Endurance, is its price. At $45,000 it’s directly price-competitive with gas-powered models from GM and Ford.The company is targeted at large fleet-buyers, claiming the Endurance gets the equivalent of 75 miles per gallon of fuel. Burns says 40,000 units have been pre-ordered, worth $1.4 billion. Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow, an Ohio native, has been signed as spokesman for the truck.David Hamamoto, the man behind DiamondPeak, is a former real estate executive whose NorthStar real estate empire had merged in 2016. Hamamoto resigned from it in 2017. He is also a former executive with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).  DiamondPeak was formed in 2019 specifically to merge with a private company like Lordstown.InvestorPlace writers hold different opinions about the new company.Louis Navillier loves it. He likes the market and notes that those who bought DiamondPeak shares before the merger saw them rise, at one point, to over $30 each. He noted that the merger brings Lordstown $675 million in cash to get Endurance into production.Alex Sirois is more skeptical. He likes the fleet vertical because it means Lordstown doesn’t have to build a dealer network. But he notes that reservations to buy the truck cost just $100, so it’s a deal people can get out of. He also notes that fleet sales are a very competitive business. It’s an important niche for both GM and Ford.I suspect that all these start-ups — Nikola, Lordstown and Workhorse Group (NASDAQ:WKHS) — are actually stalking horses in Detroit’s effort to catch Tesla.Not that there’s anything wrong with that. Wall Street has turned thumbs down on Detroit’s plans for electrics, but it seems to love electric vehicle start-ups. The combined value of all three companies comes to about $13 billion. This means Detroit can afford to buy them out, and GM already has a deal in place with Nikola, which is the most valuable of the three.But for all the speculation around support from President Donald Trump’s administration, or the possibility of a U.S. Postal Service contract, Tesla remains the 800-pound elephant in the space.Tesla is now to these start-ups what GM was to Tesla just a few years ago. Tesla is scaled. It has the brand name, and it has the market.If Lordstown can get trucks out the door, the best thing for it might be to be bought by one of the Detroit companies. The ceiling, in short, is limited.On the date of publication, Dana Blankenhorn did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.Dana Blankenhorn has been a financial journalist since 1978.

58,"Oct 30, 2020 12:01PM EDT","Investors in Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) are having a very bad day today. Everyone in the stock market seems to be having a bad day, with the S&P 500 down nearly 2% and the Nasdaq down more than 2.5%. But investors in the electric car maker are suffering even more than most on Friday, incurring a 6.1% loss through 11:10 a.m. EDT on no apparent bad news specific to Tesla.Tesla investors could be looking at a 3-car race. Image source: Getty Images.Instead, Tesla is tumbling in a stock market rocked by the latest coronavirus numbers, as the U.S. marches seemingly inexorably beyond 9 million infections, and toward 230,000 deaths.Tesla also seems to face more competition in the electric car market. Earlier this week, Consumer Reports said that in its real-world driving tests, General Motors' (NYSE: GM) Super Cruise autonomous technology outperformed Tesla's Autopilot, leaving Tesla ""a distant second"" in its rankings.Wall Street responded quickly to the report, with Wedbush saying Thursday that GM's Hummer electric vehicle has sold out in its pre-order phase, and could prove a strong competitor to Tesla.  And today, Reuters is reporting that Ford (NYSE: F) is building its Active Driver Assist hardware into its very first batch of redesigned F-150 pickups and Mustang Mach-E electric SUVs, which will go on sale this year. By the third quarter of 2021, the company plans to activate the software remotely, adding new competition for Tesla.

59,"Oct 30, 2020 10:17AM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmid a seasonally spooky October following a stellar quarterly run, is Sunrun (NYSE:RUN) worth buying today? Let’s see what’s happening off and on the price chart for RUN stock, then propose a stronger, risk-adjusted determination for investors. RUN shareholders enjoyed a sizzling (if not dizzying) rally this summer and into the fall. From July up to a peak and all-time-high share price of $82.42 on October 1, Sunrun soared higher by just over 175%.Not bad, right? It’s absolutely true, especially compared to solid broader market gains on either side of 10% for the quarter.Behind the unusually strong rally in RUN shares, it’s fairly common knowledge the solar industry has become a hot play in 2020. Along with alternative energy plays ranging from the largest of the large like EV manufacturer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to more speculative hydrogen outfits such as Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG), this expansive and diverse market has increasingly felt the love from Wall Street on the back of expectations of a Democratic White House and in-tow ‘greener’ energy initiatives.Still, Sunrun’s stock performance stood out as an early achiever in the space.Shares outpaced the Invesco Solar ETF (NYSEARCA:TAN) by almost three-to-one over for the quarter ending in September. RUN also crushed enviable rallies in heavily-traded peers First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR), SolarEdge (NASDAQ:SEDG), Canadian Solar (NASDAQ:CSIQ) and many others. So what’s the deal?The jumpstart RUN experienced could be attributed to the company’s announced buyout of rival Vivint Solar followed by the Justice Department’s ‘early termination’ of an antitrust waiting period. The deal combines the market’s two largest residential solar installers into one massive renewable energy giant. Cost synergies estimated at around $90 million may have been another factor at play, as Sunrun’s sales and marketing costs have been trending higher since 2017.The Motley Fool theorizes investors may have partly bid shares up on Sunrun’s increased investment into virtual power plants. In a nutshell, as RUN introduces more energy storage systems it can combine and bid the platforms into competitive power markets. It’s potentially another revenue stream for the company’s thousands of installations each year.October has been a different and more frightening story for many RUN investors though. The good news in this strategist’s estimation, the price action is actually less scary and resembles what happens consistently to even the best stocks.
Source: Charts by TradingViewThe fact is, all stocks correct. And those odds increase after sizable rallies. Even in healthy market environments, profit-taking will eventually make its mark on the price chart.Technically, considering RUN stock’s October stumble of 36%, the loss in valuation is standard fare for a volatile stock of Sunrun’s caliber. Losses on either side of 30% during risk-on trading environments are routine. And in less benign market cycles, corrective declines of 40% and even 50% aren’t uncommon while the broader market peels off 5% to 10%.It is what it is. And with the likes of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite giving back 4% to 6% in September and roughly 1% to 2% in October, without oversimplifying matters, it’s likely as simple as that. Looking forward though, buying in the aftermath of RUN’s correction and today’s bullishly-oversold and well-supported candlestick signal is slightly more challenging.There is next week’s election to consider. It nearly goes without saying the Presidency is going to a contested and drawn out event. Sunrun also has earnings. That raises the bar on uncertainty as a lot of moving parts beyond one or two numbers goes into how investors react to any given quarterly report. I’ll leave it at that, well almost.Among other expectations, Wall Street’s analyst community is forecasting 2 cents per share on sales of $209 million from Sunrun when it reports November 6. More importantly, investors should be braced for significant gap risk which works both ways. And the way I see it, given where RUN has been, is right now on the price chart and potentially how things may or may not take shape going into the new year, the January $60 / $65 bull call spread looks about right when weighing the risks versus the potential rewards.Stocks Owned: On the date of publication, Chris Tyler holds, directly or indirectly, positions in Plug Power (PLUG) but no other securities mentioned in this article.Chris Tyler is a former floor-based, derivatives market maker on the American and Pacific exchanges.

60,"Oct 30, 2020 9:14AM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAfter its stock market debut, what’s next for Lordstown Motors (NASDAQ:RIDE) stock? When its merger deal was announced back in August, these shares, formerly known as DPHC stock, soared. They went from around $10 per share to as high as $31.80.But, in the weeks since the stock reached that high, the “EV bubble” has taken a breather. RIDE stock, along with other names vying to become the next Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA,) have headed lower. Development-stage EV companies like Lordstown may offer massive long-term potential. Yet the pressure’s on for them to deliver.Can Lordstown live up to its still-high expectations? All bets are off. On one hand, the company’s flagship Endurance EV truck may have enough factors on its side to ensure that it’s a winner right out of the gate.On the other hand, the company has its work cut out for it. Sure, since it’s using a former General Motors (NYSE:GM) plant for its manufacturing operations, its long-term infrastructure needs have already been met. But if the company fails to turn the initial interest in Endurance into consistently strong sales, Lordstown could wind up having excess capacity.So as the stock heads closer to the  offering price of around $10 per share, what should investors do with it? RIDE stock remains a high-risk but high-potential opportunity.  As the shares pull back,  now is the time to consider entering a long-term position in the name.It’s no surprise that the closing of Lordstown’s merger with  DiamondPeak, a SPAC, hasn’t fueled a rebound by this stock. While SPAC stocks, EV stocks, and SPAC stocks with EV catalysts were “too hot to touch” earlier this year, the speculation that lifted these stocks has started to taper off.That being said, the party may not be over yet for SPAC EV plays, including RIDE stock. As InvestorPlace’s Sarah Smith reported on Oct. 27, there’s a major catalyst just around the corner that could fuel a second wave of “EV mania:” next week’s U.S. Presidential elections.If former Vice President Joe Biden wins the White House, we could see large investments by the federal government  in “green” initiatives. That could help drive another near-term rally by Lordstown Motors and other major EV stocks.Sure, it may not be worth chasing RIDE stock now, in an effort to benefit from a quick short-term pop. But Biden’s push for clean energy could fuel long-term demand for EVs by governments. And, since Lordstown’s focus is on EV trucks for the fleet market, demand from federal, state, and municipal agencies for its vehicle could be strong.But consider this a secondary long-term catalyst. More important factors remain in motion, which in tandem could drive this stock significantly higher in the coming years.Earlier this month, I laid out how RIDE stock has all the ingredients to become a long-term winner. First, with 40,000 pre-orders for the Endurance, there’s more than sufficient demand for the commercial EV truck.Secondly, with fuel costs a major pain point among the owners of commercial fleets, the shift to EVs could happen sooner in this market than in passenger vehicles. Thirdly, as I mentioned above, Lordstown has the infrastructure to become a major EV manufacturer.Thanks to its purchase of the former GM plant in Lordstown, OH, the company claims it has the capacity to produce up to 600,000 vehicles per year. With the Endurance sporting a sticker price of $52,000, this could mean potential revenue of well over $30 billion, on par with Tesla’s sales today.But before you rush out and buy RIDE stock, keep a few things in mind. Namely, the company isn’t set to deliver vehicles until the second half of 2021. While  that’s not very far away, a lot could change in the meantime.As InvestorPlace columnist Joel Bagole noted in his Oct. 20 article, since the company has yet to manufacture vehicles, who’s to say there won’t be issues when the Endurance starts rolling off the assembly lines? Any sort of manufacturing hiccup or delay could shatter confidence in this company’s ambitions, quickly sending Lordstown’s shares down to the single digits.Sure, investor mania over EV stocks is starting to fade. But with Lordstown’s compelling prospects and its tremendous potential to become a major EV maker, it’s premature to throw out this baby with the bathwater.This development-stage EV company still has much to prove. But, with multiple factors on its side, Lordstown has a better shot than many of its rivals to become the “next Tesla.”So, what’s the play now? While this remains a solid opportunity, don’t go hog-wild. Consider RIDE stock a cautious buy as its shares pull back.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not (either directly or indirectly) hold any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Thomas Niel, a contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single stock analysis since 2016.The post Don’t Abandon Lordstown Motors Stock Just Yet appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dont-abandon-lordstown-motors-stock-just-yet-2020-10-30

61,"Oct 30, 2020 6:46AM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOne of the big surprises of this year is that Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) has become a red-hot growth stock. This has actually come after lackluster returns for the past two decades. But everything has changed suddenly in 2020, with PLUG stock going from $3.80 to $15. The market capitalization is now at $6 billion.But a few days after the election, the company, which is a top player in the hydrogen fuel cell market, will report its third quarter results. And yes, Wall Street is quite bullish on expectations.The consensus is for a spike in revenues by 80% to $110 million. As for the bottom line, the earnings per share is expected to come in with a loss of 7 cents a share.Keep in mind that the Covid-19 pandemic has not slowed down Plug Power. Just look at some of the highlights of the quarter:I’ve been bullish on PLUG stock for some time. The main reason: the long-term prospects look extremely favorable. As seen with the huge success of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), there is substantial demand for alternative energy approaches.  The sentiment is quickly becoming mainstream.Now it’s true that the use of hydrogen fuel cells has its downsides. The costs are still high and there have been challenges with adoption. There will also need to be heavy investments in infrastructure.But despite all this, there continue to be great strides in improving hydrogen cells. For example, according to a study from McKinsey: “By scaling up across sectors, hydrogen demand in the U.S. could reach 17 million metric tons by 2030 and 63 million metric tons by 2050, roughly equivalent to 14 percent of energy demand.”If this prediction pans out, then Plug Power will be in an ideal position. The company has the advantages of scale and an extensive platform of systems and technologies. There is also a customer list that includes biggies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Kroger (NYSE:KR), FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT).Another essential part of the strategy has been to focus on the materials handling market. This requires an energy source for long-range transportation.And finally, the company has been smart to pursue an aggressive M&A strategy. Deals for companies like United Hydrogen and Giner ELX have expanded the product line and opened up new market opportunities.While the long-term prospects look positives, investors may still want to get a better price point on PLUG stock. The election is likely to stir up more volatility – and this could put lots of pressure on growth stocks. Let’s face it, there’s a chance that it could take a while to determine who will win.And even if there is a slight miss for Q3 earnings, this will mean even more selling. So for now, it’s probably best to wait on PLUG stock.On the date of publication, Tom Taulli did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.Tom Taulli (@ttaulli) is an advisor/board member for startups and author of various books and online courses about technology, including Artificial Intelligence Basics, The Robotic Process Automation Handbook and Learn Python Super Fast.

64,"Oct 29, 2020 11:03PM EDT","HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - American elections are closely watched in China, but this time the outcome of the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 3 may matter less to Beijing. U.S. President Donald Trump’s tough act on China has wrought little real damage. And while neither he nor his challenger, former Vice President Joe Biden, is likely to thaw relations, the fumbling of the pandemic has left the U.S. more at risk. Trump has set out to weaken China with policies that were a pillar of his presidency since he took office in 2017. A trade war dented some aspects of commerce with America, but elsewhere is helping to make up for it. Exports are surging to Europe and Asia – making the punishments he’s affected look wobbly. The intended ban on Chinese social app TikTok is facing judicial pushback at home that could continue to contradict Trump’s orders. And many U.S. firms are still exhibiting clear reluctance to exit China, exemplified by Tesla's latest investment in a Shanghai factory.Meanwhile the country led by President Xi Jinping has also emerged much stronger from the virus, in what many citizens see as China's institutional strength, demonstrated by its tougher pandemic response. Most of the country is now free of Covid-19, with an impressive economic rebound of 4.9% in the July-to-September quarter. Despite that the U.S. economy appears to be bouncing back too, based on numbers that were released Thursday, it is facing another surge and lockdowns are being threatened in various cities across the country just as the winter months take hold. U.S. pressure on China will continue if Trump is the winner next week. Biden, meanwhile, may look to mend fences with foreign allies who can take a more coordinated approach to weakening the presumed adversary. The People's Republic remained the subject for blame during much of the final presidential debate last week, at least one sign that whoever occupies the Oval Office will remain tough on China. And Washington has more cards to play, including implementing a law that could force Chinese companies to delist from U.S. stock exchanges. Still Beijing seems ready to play tough. Xi recently spoke at the anniversary of the deployment of Chinese troops to fight against U.S. forces in the Korean War, warning of consequences if the Chinese people are ""trifled with"". His economy still depends on others – including the U.S. But as long as it remains relatively strong, China has less to worry about for now.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/breakingviews-trump-vs.-biden-is-sideshow-for-xi-2020-10-30

66,"Oct 29, 2020 4:47PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI’m not here to tell you that you should buy shares of the shamed electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA). With what short-sellers have accused the company of, and how much light has shined on it, this is a toxic organization to say the least. Conservative investors should absolutely stay away from Nikola stock.But at the same time, most of my readers gravitate toward my work because I often provide angles that the competition doesn’t. Love or hate me, I’m not your typical writer. And honestly, if you gleaned any new information from my articles — again, whether you agree or disagree with the premise — my job is done.So — I have to ask — is there anything about Nikola that hasn’t been touched on extensively?I don’t claim to be an arbiter of all information on the company, but there is one angle that deserves more attention: China.As InvestorPlace contributor David Moadel points out, American icon General Motors (NYSE:GM) sees an opportunity with NKLA. That’s significant because, despite the ugliness that has pummeled Nikola stock, GM is sticking around with the underlying organization. The incentive, Moadel notes, is likely profit driven.Further, I’ve mentioned before that GM has every incentive not to associate with bad actors. Remember, not too long ago, this was an American company that killed American drivers and devastated families. In our politically charged environment, that’s not something you should ignore.But within this production partnership between Nikola and GM, there is a silver lining. By combining two American companies together to work on an innovative platform in fierce competition with China, they have a massive PR opportunity.Not only would that help Nikola stock, it could potentially provide longer-term payoffs.Undoubtedly, President Donald Trump must take responsibility for how he handled the novel coronavirus pandemic. Yes, Trump can blame the “China virus” or the “Chinese virus” or “kung flu” — whatever he wants to call it. But at the end of the day, he had an opportunity to show leadership, and he failed.In addition, the racism that has been directed against Asian Americans — and not just by white Americans, as the mainstream media suggests — is awfully rich.But fair is fair. If we’re going to blame our own president for his pandemic response, we must also criticize the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Moreover, if global public sentiment is anything to go by, holding China accountable appears to be a bipartisan issue.According to a Pew Research Center report, approximately two-thirds of surveyed countries across Europe, Asia and Oceania hold a very negative view about China. That will also likely worsen because, in my opinion, we’ve not seen any contrition from China’s top brass. Instead, the country has turned to nationalism, as the Wall Street Journal notes. It has confronted international anger with audacious indignation.Essentially, China is the Houston Astros of the international community, a team that only the hometown appreciates. It’s enough to make you buy American whenever possible. And that’s how Nikola stock stands to benefit, potentially.Heck, Trump could possibly win a second term because his toughness on China is more than justified.This narrative is not as unrealistic as you might believe — for both Nikola and Trump.I want to be clear about something: I don’t agree with the rhetoric that Trump uses in his prosecution of China. But the reason he downplayed the novel coronavirus was because he didn’t want to panic everyone. Or, he felt that Americans were too foolish to not be panicked.And maybe he made the right call there, given the toilet paper hysteria that ensued organically earlier this year. But by that logic — that some Americans are too foolish — he should have realized that some Americans are also too ignorant to distinguish a CCP bureaucrat from the average Asian American.That’s my beef with Trump. His logic was applied inconsistently, and many Asian Americans of varying ethnic backgrounds have paid for it.All said, though, the underlying message is correct — China should have been more transparent with the pandemic. And because the CCP is acting like the Astros, American and international consumers have a great way of penalizing it: a good old boycott.Of course, boycotting all Chinese products is virtually impossible. What we can do, however, is avoid making expensive purchases that directly or indirectly benefit China. I would classify EV purchases as one of these cases.Such collective global action would not just help Nikola stock directly. It would also provide a sharp contrast to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which has significant ties to China. For instance, Australia has an 81% unfavorable view of China according to Pew. So how likely is it that the Aussies will buy a Chinese-manufactured Tesla? Or the Swedish, at 85%? Or consumers in Japan, where the unfavorable view is 86%, the worst of the Pew-surveyed nations?I mention this because the international animosity against China is real. And that could truly be a catalyst for Nikola stock somewhere down the line.Having said all that, I don’t want you to misunderstand where I’m coming from — Nikola stock is highly speculative. Please don’t buy Nikola thinking that it’s guaranteed to move higher. It’s not.However, I can’t ignore that the GM-Nikola partnership — if it continues forward as was expected before the exposé — has a strong fundamental catalyst. Obviously, the two companies would have to exercise this opportunity. But if they do so tactfully, it could work out.Bottom line, if Trump wins the election, at least look into this narrative before making your decision.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in NKLA.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

67,"Oct 29, 2020 9:55AM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNot to be a stickler for details, but the 2020s actually begin this Jan. 1, 2021. Over the next decade, InvestorPlace will continue to cover the investment themes that interest our readers. One subject sure to generate interest is in ESG investing. Bank of America estimates that $20 trillion — the size of the S&P 500 — will flow into environmental, social and governance strategies over the next 20 years as millennials and Generation Z become the primary investors. When it comes to the “E” part of ESG investing, climate change and global warming are a subject near and dear to people of all ages. A recent study by Stanford University’s Resources for the Future and ReconMR found that at least 60% of Americans believe climate change will be a serious issue in the future.“These data provide strong signals to many policymakers about how their constituents would like them to vote on legislation related to global warming. With just over a week until the presidential election, these findings document the likely role that climate will play in voting decisions from coast to coast,” stated social psychologist Jon Krosnick, the study’s co-author and a professor at Stanford.Companies of all sizes are implementing policies to reduce their carbon footprint. Certain businesses will benefit from this focus. Covid-19 is sure to alter ESG investing in the future. We asked Laura Gonzalez, Ph.D., an associate professor of finance at California State University, Long Beach, to comment on these changes.“Covid-19 has increased uncertainty levels in all aspects of life and changed lifestyles. There is less need to travel and less opportunities to socialize. This will reflect in expenditure decisions,” Gonzalez wrote in an email to InvestorPlace.com.“Also, unemployment is increasing world-wide and recovery will take years towards a new normal. This means that new sustainability options will be explored, especially aided by technology or more likely to protect users or consumers from disease.”These 10 stocks are working to slow global warming. Each of them plans to do well by doing good. Long-term, ESG investing will be a winning strategy for all stakeholders.The stocks of European wind-related businesses such as Vestas had the wind at their backs, figuratively speaking, in the third quarter. Vestas’ stock gained 53% during the three months ended Sept. 30, while Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy (OTCMKTS:GCTAY) gained 46% over the same period.Wind power is a hot commodity in 2020 as governments worldwide commit further spending to green energy. “The wind energy sector, in particular, has ‘proven resilient amid the coronavirus pandemic, and we anticipate this may continue into the fourth quarter, which is typically the strongest quarter for installs and revenue recognition,’” Bloomberg Intelligence clean-energy analyst James Evans commented in early October.  How busy is one of the world’s biggest manufacturers of wind turbines?Year to date through Oct. 27, it’s announced 11,089 megawatts of orders. In the fourth quarter of 2019, Vestas had 4,439 MW of orders. It will be hard-pressed to meet its 2019 order total (17,877 MW) but given we’ve been in a global pandemic for most of the year, 2020 has to be viewed as a big success. I must admit I had never heard of Umicore until I saw it listed amongst the iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF (NASDAQ:SDG) holdings. As an aside, SDG is an easy way to play climate change and other serious issues facing our planet. At 0.49% annually, it’s a reasonably fair price to pay for an impact fund.As for Umicore, Goldman Sachs recommended the company’s stock in July, suggesting that its cathode materials business will benefit from the European Union’s Green Deal, aiming to have net-zero carbon emissions 2050.   Umicore once was a large-scale polluter. Now its shareholders are hoping to ride the sustainability and cleantech movement all the way to the bank. So far in 2020, its stock has been in a downer, losing almost 20% year to date. While its revenues have been affected by Covid-19, the future is promising. “The current crisis does not change the need for the world to move towards a more sustainable path, as evidenced by the various government stimuli for cleaner mobility and green initiatives, in China and Europe in particular, Umicore, with its broad materials technology portfolio and production footprint, can play a key role in enabling the transition to zero-emission mobility,” stated the company’s July 31 press release announcing its results for the first half of 2020. It’s easy to cheer for a company that’s trying to make a difference. It’s hard to do a story about ESG investing without mentioning an EV company like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). After all, it’s led the charge in North America and worldwide to deliver electric vehicles that are both fun to drive and good for the planet. There would likely be no Nio (NYSE:NIO) and others without Elon Musk’s inspirational vision. Tesla is SDG’s largest holding with a weighting of 4.7%. The Environmental Protection Agency has started to release its 2021 ratings for electric vehicles. The Tesla Model 3 Long-Range version gets 134 miles per gallon. The highest rating for an electric vehicle not made by Tesla is the 2021 Mini Cooper SE Hardtop 2-door automatic. Seven out of the top 10 are made by Tesla. The Tesla Model 3 Long Range gets 141 MPG in the city. I don’t even want to know how badly my Jeep Cherokee does under the same conditions. It’s truly an amazing side-by-side comparison. If you thought it was too late to buy Tesla stock in early January because it had a good year in 2019 — up 25% — you’ve missed out on 408% appreciation.   In May 2018, I argued that Tesla was headed to $400 ($80 post-split), not $200. Well, it has actually gone to $2,123 on a pre-split basis.  More than two years later, I continue to appreciate the company’s innovative ways.Earlier this year, I happened to see an article in Wired that discussed how the oldest solar panels were coming to the end of their natural lives–leaving a massive amount of industrial waste in its wake. The International Renewable Energy Agency estimates that by 2050, solar waste will account for approximately 6 million metric tons. That defeats the purpose of solar energy. Thankfully, First Solar understands that solar energy won’t be nearly as beneficial to the planet if these panels don’t have a recycling game plan. Currently, First Solar reclaims 90% of the glass and semiconductor materials from their solar panels, well ahead of the European Union’s standards. “Our aim for solar is to help our customers decouple their economic growth from negative environmental impacts,” Andreas Wade, global sustainability director for First Solar told Fast Company recently. “So it is kind of a mandatory point for us to address the renewable-energy-circular-economy nexus today and not 20 years from now.”I recommend you read its 2020 Sustainability Report. And if you’re wondering about the business, sales jumped 70% in the third quarter and earnings per share ($1.45), beating the analyst estimates of $676.5 million and 68 cents per share. FSLR is definitely walking on the bright side of the road.Most of the recent InvestorPlace commentary about this Florida-based utility has generally been quite positive. That includes me. I included NextEra Energy in a list of 20 stocks to buy if Joe Biden wins the 2020 election. I could find the only negative comments from Mark Hake, who recently expressed valuation and growth concerns for NEE stock.“The fact that NextEra Energy seems to be stuck in Florida for its growth is concerning. Unless it can convince another utility to agree to a merger or acquisition, its growth will be geographically limited,” my colleague wrote on Oct. 19. “I am also a bit concerned that the stock is now overvalued. For example, in the past year, NextEra Energy stock is up 29%. On a year-to-date basis, the stock is up 24%. That is pretty good for a utility stock.”It is indeed. And why is that the case?In large part, I believe it is the work done on the renewable energy front that has investors so excited. Clean energy will continue to drive the company’s share price higher as ESG investing becomes more popular. “We expect that our investments in emissions-free wind and solar generation, innovative battery storage technology, low-emissions natural gas generation, safe and emissions-free nuclear power, industry-leading energy efficiency programs and transmission lines designed to deliver energy where it’s needed when it’s needed will enable us to continue providing a wide range of benefits to our many valued stakeholders,” NextEra writes on the renewable energy page of its website. As my colleague, Josh Enomoto, said recently, “young people care about clean energy.”I’ll go one step further and say that anyone who cares about this planet cares about clean energy. It’s that simple. NextEra is the world’s largest generator of renewable energy. I fail to see how investors can’t get behind its story. One of my best calls for 2020 was my suggestion in December 2019 that Plug Power was an excellent speculative buy under $3. Up 368% year to date, the company’s push to generate $1 billion in revenue by 2024 has captivated investors everywhere. In late September, Morgan Stanley analyst Stephen Byrd upgraded PLUG to overweight from equal-weight while also raising its 12-month target price by $3.75 to $14. As I write this, it’s trading above Byrd’s target, 11 months early. Benzinga reported some of Byrd’s analysis. “Plug is a key enabler of the greater usage of green hydrogen, which is created from increasingly cheap renewable energy — this essentially allows for the extension of renewable energy usage into the Transportation and Industrial sectors, a result that could greatly reduce the carbon emission profiles of these sectors,” Byrd stated in a note to clients.Byrd also projected that Plug Power would meet its 2024 goal for $1 billion in revenue — the analyst believes it will generate $1.3 billion in revenue in 2024 with 21% annual growth until 2030. That’s a lot of growth. Trading at almost 16 times sales, I believe this is one of those stocks that will grow into its valuation. While it might seem expensive today, I’m confident its work across many industries will pay dividends in the future. At that point you’ll be kicking yourself for not buying its stock. In my opinion, Plug Power has gone from speculative buy to plain-old all-around buy. This is the kind of ESG investing that has promising growth throughout the next decade.Like NextEra, Atlantica Sustainable Infrastructure is a utility with a major focus on renewable energy. It has assets in North America (45% of revenue), South America (12%), Europe, the Middle East and Africa (43%). Its 27 assets include solar, wind, efficient natural gas, electric transmission, and water. California and Arizona are home to two of the company’s most important assets. Solana in Arizona and Mojave in California both have 280 MW capacity. The company’s assets are supported by long-term contracts with local utilities. The average contract has more than 18 years remaining, providing it with stable cash flow. If you’re into income, AY stock currently yields 5.8%. In terms of ESG investing, Sustainalytics gives it an ESG Risk Score of 9.7, which means Atlantica provides almost no ESG risk. In 2019, it ranked first out of 48 companies involved in renewable power production, first out of 442 utilities, and 58th out of a global universe of 12,228 companies. If you’re interested in a backdoor way to invest in Atlantica, Canadian utility Algonquin Power & Utilities (NYSE:AQN) owns 44.2% of the company. Based in Toronto, it has utilities that operate in several U.S. states, and it owns or has an interest in more than 35 clean energy facilities. It yields 3.4%. My wife and I swore off meat several years ago. We did it because of the poor treatment of cows and other meat-supply animals. However, we also stopped eating meat (I still eat fish) because of the incredible strain farming puts on the planet. The Washington Post covered the subject in November 2019. “Since cows are the most carbon-intensive part of the food industry — cattle are responsible for 62 percent of agricultural emissions — eating fewer of them is one of the most powerful steps an individual can take toward protecting the planet,” Washington Post contributor Sarah Kaplan wrote. “A 2017 study found that if every American swapped out all the beef in their diet for beans, it would get the United States halfway to meeting the 2020 greenhouse gas emission targets laid out in the Paris climate accord.”Say what you will about the quality of Beyond Meat products or even the health benefits compared to beef, there is no argument that the company isn’t doing its part to save the planet from self-destructing. “[T]he Beyond Burger generates 90% less greenhouse gas emissions and requires 46% less energy, 99% less water and 93% less land compared to a quarter pound of U.S. beef,” CNBC stated in September 2019.  Now, I’m not naïve enough to think the study from which the above statistics were drawn — commissioned by Beyond Meat — is flawless in its conclusions. However, logic dictates that a plant-based diet is better for the environment. Oxford professor Marco Springmann discussed the subject in the same CNBC article.“It makes sense to develop alternatives to beef, because we have to change our eating habits to more plant-based diets if we want to limit global warming to under 2 degrees Celsius. Impossible and Beyond tap into this market,” the senior environmental researcher told CNBC.Trust me. If you try Beyond Meat’s spicy Italian sausage, you won’t want to eat one filled with beef. Great companies — and stocks — solve problems. You can add Beyond Meat to the ESG investing buy list.The success of electric vehicles depends on two things: Affordable prices for the mass market (without subsidies) and charging stations on almost every corner. Both requirements won’t be met for several years. In the meantime, ChargePoint is looking to capture a big chunk of the global electric vehicle charging network. It’s already said to be the world’s largest with more than 83 million charges provided since its founding in 2007. In case you’re counting, that has eliminated the need for 102 million gallons of gasoline. As for global warming, its EV charging network’s led to a reduction of 341,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions. ChargePoint estimates that the EV charging industry will require an infrastructure investment of $190 billion by 2030. Its first-mover advantage is why energy-focused special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), Switchback Energy Acquisition Corp., has agreed to combine with ChargePoint. “ChargePoint has distinguished itself as the number one EV charging network and is well positioned to deliver mission-critical charging infrastructure as the expected transition to electric mobility accelerates,” Switchback CEO Scott McNeill stated in the press release announcing the combination in late September. “ChargePoint has a proven and capital-light business model that combines hardware and high-margin, recurring software subscriptions and services with extensive and strong customer relationships.”I couldn’t agree more. That’s why I recently gave SBE a big thumbs up as a prime ESG investing picl. Each time I walk by my local gas station, I can’t help but think about the Switchback/ChargePoint tie-up. And that’s an excellent thing.  I know what you’re thinking: Why is this guy talking about an alternative asset manager? This is supposed to be an article about climate change and ESG investing. Well, Brookfield has $550 billion in assets under management. Amongst the high-quality assets it owns that operates in more than 30 countries worldwide is 50.4%-owned Brookfield Renewable Partners LLC (NYSE:BEP). Brookfield Renewable is one of the largest renewable energy companies globally with more than 5,300 facilities in North America, South America, Europe and Asia, capable of producing 19,300 MW of power with a pipeline of 18,000 MW under development. Five years ago, Brookfield Renewable had just a 3 MW pipeline. Boy, how things have changed. On Oct. 27, the company announced that it would provide power to more than 90% of JPMorgan Chase’s (NYSE:JPM) New York City offices. This will help the bank move toward its goal of 100% renewable energy for its entire worldwide business.Investors might have noticed a recent high-profile appointment at the renewable energy business. It hired Mark Carney, the former Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor, as the company’s vice-chair. It also promoted chief investment officer Connor Teskey to CEO. The former CEO, Sachin Shah, has become Brookfield Asset Management’s CIO. Brookfield Asset CEO Bruce Flatt continues to assemble the best talent to deliver long-term returns for shareholders.

68,"Oct 29, 2020 9:47AM EDT","Oct 29 (Reuters) - Ganfeng Lithium 002460.SZ, 1772.HK, one of the world's top producers of the commodity used in electric-vehicle batteries, on Thursday reported a big jump in third-quarter profit but pulled out of a deal that would have boosted its output.The Chinese company, which supplies lithium to automakers including Tesla Inc TSLA.O and BMW BMWG.DE, posted net income of 174 million yuan ($26 million) for July-September, a filing to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange showed.That was up more than fivefold from 33.4 million yuan a year earlier, when Ganfeng had reported a sharp drop in the value of its financial assets, and marked its best result since the first quarter of 2019. Revenues rose 8.5% year-on-year to 1.51 billion yuan in the third quarter but fell 7.5% in the first nine months of 2020, in which Ganfeng managed to eke out only a 0.4% increase in profit.In China, prices for battery chemical lithium carbonate AM-99C-LTCB are down some 10% year-to-date amid ample supply.""The company's production and sales ... increased, but the price of lithium salt products fell,"" Ganfeng said, noting its lithium battery sales had also climbed.In a separate filing, Ganfeng said it had terminated a deal announced in August that would have seen it take over 25,000 tonnes of annual lithium carbonate and 5,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide production from smaller firms including Jiangxi Special Electric Motor Co 002176.SZ. The two sides ""failed to reach an agreement on the technological transformation plan for the lithium salt production lines"" and opted to terminate the agreement, which would have run from this month to March 2023, it said.Ganfeng produced just over 54,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent in 2019.Upstream, one of its raw material suppliers, Australian spodumene producer Altura Mining AJM.AX, announced on Monday it had gone into receivership, although a Ganfeng spokesman played down the impact on the company.

69,"Oct 29, 2020 7:45AM EDT","In a Fool Live segment recorded just before Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) earnings report last week, ""The Wrap"" host Jason Hall and the Fool's contributing senior technology specialist Daniel Sparks took a look at key areas for investors to focus on when the automaker reported third-quarter results. In addition, Daniel explained why the key narrative for Tesla stock is the underlying rapid growth in its business.This video was recorded on Oct. 20, 2020.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Tesla wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.See the 10 stocks *Stock Advisor returns as of October 20, 2020 Transcript:Jason Hall: Daniel, I know people want to hear a little bit about Tesla. Let's check in on what's going on there. What are you looking to hear from Tesla when it reports in the next couple of days?Daniel Sparks: Yeah. Tesla tomorrow after close. So that'll be interesting. As always, they've already reported their quarterly deliveries. They always do that a few days after quarter-end. So we know it's going to be a big quarter year-over-year -- record deliveries by far, year-over-year growth of 43 percent and it was up sequentially 53 percent. So obviously, the sequential growth there is because Fremont factory was shut down for half the quarter last period.So what I think we're going to be looking at though, as usual, when Tesla reports earnings is investors like to check in on the growth story because the stock is valued for so much of the future. One of the ways I'm going to be doing that is to see what management is saying about guidance for vehicle deliveries and demand for its cars. Of course, the energy business and all that, it's very important. But just headline figures, those are some of the things that we'll be looking at because it represents such a huge portion of the thesis for the stock.So just a little bit of background going into 2020, Tesla had guided for 500,000 vehicles this year. Which was up, I think from about 368,000 -- somewhere around there -- in 2019. So they expected some big growth. A lot of that was going to come from the Model 3, continued growth there -- and then the introduction of the Model Y in March. Then they suspended that guidance during the COVID-19, during the heat of the shutdowns -- when factories were shut down. They actually reported earnings while it was shutdown. So they suspended it. But then they reinstated that guidance.Now, they say they're back on track. But they're going to need another enormous sequential jump in fourth-quarter deliveries to be able to hit that 500,000 sales. So it's not totally in the bag. But if they guide, and they say they can still hit this number, it's really going to signal two things. That the progress at their factories is really ramping up. Which they've got a lot going on. They got Berlin, they got China, they got product line expansions, production line expansions here at Fremont. So they're really ramping up. So it's going to signal that confidence in their manufacturing capability, which by the way, Tesla has really gone from someone who is not very good at manufacturing five-years ago to a very good at ramping up new product lines. We've seen that in both with Tesla Energy and the Model Y very recently, and then the Shanghai factory. So that's what I'm going to be looking at. Will Tesla reiterate the 500,000 guidance? Maybe in the commentary, we can find out how demand is doing. I'm not too worried about demand, I think it kind of grows organically with deliveries. But yeah, that's what I'm looking for.Jason Hall: They're sure got a pretty big bang on their marketing dollar, don't they? The company doesn't spend a penny on marketing.Daniel Sparks: You're right.Jason Hall: They get millions of free advertising on Twitter every single day.Daniel Sparks: Yeah. I think it's not that orders are always far in advance of production, but it's really that demand grows with sales as more cars get out there and show their neighbors. People haven't really tried it and customers sell the cars. So that's why I'm not necessarily worried about it. But there could always be temporary blips in the demand story and it'll be interesting to see how this one plays out.Daniel Sparks has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

71,"Oct 29, 2020 7:01AM EDT","While many were stockpiling toilet paper as the pandemic escalated, others were adding more shares of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock to their portfolio, waking up to triple-digit gains this summer that seemed too good to be true. The electric car maker announced a five-for-one stock split and the stock jumped 74.2% in August alone. Tesla's meteoric rise left many investors with a tough decision: should I sell, buy more, or hold? If the temptation of cashing in on quick profits caused you to sell shares of Tesla in a standard (taxable) brokerage account, the capital gains could impact your tax returns. Taxes are probably the last thing on your mind when you're winning big in the stock market. But all investors should know this to maintain their sanity: selling stock is a taxable event. This additional income -- although unearned -- could easily put you in a higher tax bracket due to capital gains taxes.Image source: Getty ImagesCapital gains are good -- they mean you've made some money in the stock market. When you sell a stock for more than you purchased it, you have a capital gain. Let's say you bought Tesla stock for $400 and sold it for $2,000. That's a $1,600 capital gain. As much as you'd probably like to keep all the profits for yourself, the IRS believes that sharing is caring. Just like with other forms of income such as wages and dividends, you are required to share a percentage of your capital gains in the form of taxes -- at either short-term or long-term capital gains rates. If you held your investment for a year or less, you pay a short-term capital gains rate. If you invested for the long-term (over a year), you'll unlock lower tax rates. Bad news: If you bought shares of Tesla in March and sold in September (holding your shares for only six months), your short term capital gains will be included in your ordinary income. This means your profits will be taxed at ordinary income rates -- the same rates you pay on the wages you make from working a job. If you do sell enough Tesla shares that you're pushed into a higher tax bracket, don't worry -- you might not owe as much as you think. For example, if you are filing single for 2020 taxes and earned $40,000 in wages and $2,000 from short-term investments, your total taxable income would be $42,000 -- the 22% tax bracket. See chart below. But let's clear up some confusion: only a portion of your income will fall into that tax bracket.You pay 10% on the first $9,875 of taxable income, 12% on income between $9,876 and $40,125, and 22% on the rest. The total tax bill would be approximately $5,030 -- about 12% of your total taxable income, even though you're in the 22% bracket. Below are the federal tax brackets for taxes due by April 2021, for the income you earned in 2020.This is the Tax Rate for the Income in Each Range Single Filers (Taxable Income)Married Filing Jointly or Qualified WidowHeads of HouseholdMarried Filing Separately10%$0 to $9,875$0 to $19,750$0 to $14,100$0 to $9,87512%$9,876 to $40,125$19,751 to $80,250$14,101 to $53,700$9,876 to $40,12522%$40,126 to $85,525$80,251 to $171,050$53,701 to $85,500$40,126 to $85,52524%$85,526 to $163,300$171,051 to $326,600$85,501 to $163,300$85,526 to $163,30032%$163,301 to $207,350$326,601 to $414,700$163,301 to $207,350$163,301 to $207,35035%$207,351 to $518,400$414,701 to $622,050$207,351 to $518,400$207,351 to $311,02537%$518,401 or more$622,051 or more$518,401 or more$311,026 or moreData source: IRS.Selling Tesla stock that you owned for a year or less will be taxed at ordinary income rates, which could push you into another tax bracket -- although all of your income will not be taxed at that higher rate. To avoid those higher ordinary tax rates altogether, you can hold for more than a year to earn lower, more attractive long-term capital gains rates. Or pay no additional taxes at all by investing in a tax-advantaged account, such as a Roth IRA, where selling shares of Tesla won't trigger any taxes -- as long as you don't touch the money before retirement.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

72,"Oct 29, 2020 6:37AM EDT","When a friend of mine asked me about stocks the other day, I mentioned that I've been buying shares of Nano-X Imaging (NASDAQ: NNOX). And then he asked me what they did. And I told him.""X-rays?"" he said. ""But we've all got X-rays already."" And that's true. Most people in the U.S. have access to X-rays. If you have health insurance, there aren't many barriers between you and the imaging technology. But these machines are physically massive and seriously expensive.What's fascinating about Nano-X is that the company plans to offer a similar X-ray device that is smaller and cheaper to manufacture by a couple of orders of magnitude. Instead of costing over $1 million to produce and sell, Nano-X claims that it can manufacture its new X-ray device and then sell them to hospitals for only $10,000.Image source: Nano-X Imaging.Nano-X is an Israeli company commercializing an idea that was first developed in Japan. A group of Sony (NYSE: SNE) engineers were working on field-emission technology for flat-panel displays when Sony put a stop to the project. The engineers thought the technology from the project might work well for a totally different use case -- X-rays.Uniting with a venture capitalist in Japan named Hitoshi Masuya, they formed a start-up to work on a new kind of X-ray scanner. Eight years later, the company has a working prototype of their medical device, and a new CEO based in Israel, Ran Poliakine. Masuya sits on the board of directors and is still heading up the original team of engineers in Japan. The company has submitted its device to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and expects to earn its 510(k) clearance in the first half of 2021. Right now, Nano-X has no revenues, and it's hotly debated whether its machine will actually work. What's most exciting about Nano-X's potential product is the field-emission technology that is powering this X-ray instead of the traditional thermionic effect method. The typical technology requires a massive machine, because it has to manufacture a lot of heat (up to 2,000 degrees celsius), and then cool itself down. The Nano-X device doesn't need any of that. Using nanotechnology, Nano-X has developed a silicon chip that distributes this task of creating electrons across 100 million digitally controlled nanocones. That's what makes this X-ray a lot smaller, and a lot cheaper to manufacture and maintain.Nano-X plants to sell its machines at cost or even below cost, and the company will take a percentage of patient costs every time the X-ray is used. In countries where such deals are not allowed, the company will sell the machine for a profit. The scheme would still be significantly cheaper for hospitals than existing technology.For investors, the cheap up-front cost and the subscription platform are very exciting. Roughly two-thirds of the world population still do not have access to X-rays, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). About 75% of diagnostic problems can be solved through basic use of X-rays and ultrasound exams. Nano-X projects that its $300 X-ray could be reduced to as much as $40 for patients. In many places around the world, Nano-X's machine could be like the arrival of mobile phones. The X-ray, the groundbreaking 19th century technology that allows us to see inside the human body, is about to go digital. And it could be far more ubiquitous than it is at present because of Nano-X. Would it surprise you that Foxconn, the manufacturer of the iPhone, is collaborating with Nano-X as a minority shareholder? Or that SK Telecom (NYSE: SKM) has invested $23 million in the company?  Nano-X went public in August, and the stock opened at a little over $20 a share. In under two weeks, the stock doubled. By the middle of September, it had tripled to $66 a share.That's when shorts began to attack the stock, claiming that Nano-X was pulling off an elaborate fraud. The share price dropped from $66 all the way back down to $22 in about a week. The stock bounced back after Nano-X announced a live demonstration of its device will take place in November, at the Radiology Society of North America (RSNA) conference.     NNOX data by YChartsThis sort of volatility is common when you invest in rule-breakers that are disrupting the status quo. We saw it with Amazon back in the day, and Tesla more recently.

73,"Oct 29, 2020 6:02AM EDT","By Makiko YamazakiTOKYO, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Panasonic Corp 6752.T said on Thursday it is working to develop a new battery cell for Tesla Inc TSLA.O based on the U.S. electric vehicle maker's new cell format, as the Japanese company moves forward its decade-old partnership with Tesla.Tesla's new battery cell — a larger cylindrical format called 4680 that can store more energy and is easier to make — is key to achieving the goal of cutting battery costs in half and ramping up battery production nearly 100-fold by 2030. ""We have considerable know-how for that battery,"" Panasonic's Chief Financial Officer Hirokazu Umeda said at a briefing as the company reported an 11% increase in second-quarter operating profit, beating analyst estimates.""We started working on it immediately after Tesla's Battery Day (in September) and are also preparing to set up a prototype production line in parallel,"" he added.Panasonic's decision to work on the new cell for Tesla comes as brisk sales of Tesla EVs have stabilized profits at their joint battery venture in Nevada following several years of production troubles and delays at the U.S. partner.Umeda also said the company has decided to launch an additional production line at the Nevada factory next year, increasing the plant's total capacity by some 10% to 38-39 gigawatt hours (GWh) a year by around 2022.""We are targeting a profit margin of around 5% at our Tesla battery business within two to three years,"" he added.Panasonic's July-September operating profit rose to  92.8 billion yen ($886.34 million), compared with 83.9 billion yen a year ago.Tesla has said it plans to manufacture its own battery cells at several highly automated factories around the world, but will also continue to use its existing cell suppliers - Panasonic, South Korea's LG Chem 051910.KS and China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co 300750.SZ. With the advanced battery cell design and new manufacturing processes, Tesla CEO Elon Musk promised to cut battery costs in half and deliver an ""affordable"" electric car in several years, though experts have questioned how quickly they can be implemented.($1 = 104.7000 yen)(Reporting by Makiko Yamazaki; Editing by Rashmi Aich)((Makiko.Yamazaki@thomsonreuters.com; +81-3-4563-2805;))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/panasonic-beats-forecasts-developing-new-battery-cell-for-tesla-2020-10-29

74,"Oct 29, 2020 5:01AM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsYears from now, 2020 may be considered the year of the SPAC on Wall Street. The latest special acquisition company to capture the attention of investors is Spartan Energy Acquisition (NYSE:SPAQ) stock.Spartan is planning to merge with electric vehicle maker Fisker in the near future. There’s certainly nothing inherently wrong with investing in a SPAC. And there’s nothing inherently wrong with investing in EVs, either. But given that SPACs and EVs are two of the hottest mania on Wall Street at the moment, investors should be extremely cautious about buying SPAQ stock.EV stocks have been on fire in 2020, with so many traders on the hunt for the “next” Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Unfortunately, the more Wall Street gets whipped into a frenzy over a stock or a trend, the worse an investment that stock or trend tends to be. And SPAQ stock is the hottest SPAC on the market today.There’s a long history of high-tech initial public offerings that made for terrible investments, at least as they started out their publicly traded life.The best recent example is the Uber (NYSE:UBER) IPO back in 2019. At the time, many young traders saw ridesharing as a winning long-term trend. And they saw Uber as a can’t-miss investment. Founder Travis Kalanick (remember him?) saw his IPO priced at $45 only to close its first day of trading at only $42. It’s now nearly a year and a half later, and Uber shares are trading at $35.49. Ridesharing competitor Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) has performed even worse since its debut last year.Snapchat parent company Snap (NYSE:SNAP) has had a huge run in the past year, gaining nearly 200%. However, Snap was a major IPO disappointment back in 2017. The stock opened at $24 in its first day of trading back in March 2017. By September 2018, it was trading under $10. Three months later, SNAP stock was down roughly 80% to under $5.Snap eventually recovered, but it struggled mightily in its first year of trading. Overhyped IPOs Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) experienced similar patterns. True, both stocks ended up being huge long-term winners. But Facebook and Alibaba shares were down 38.4% and 12.8%, respectively, in the six months following their first days of trading.SPAQ stock bulls may believe the examples I mentioned above are purely anecdotal. However, eight of the 10 largest tech IPOs of all time were down between 25% and 71% in the 12 months following their first day of trading.One of the biggest reasons for this underperformance is insider selling. When companies go public via an IPO or a SPAC, management wants to take advantage of the publicity the brand gets. One way a company like Fisker could damage its brand is if SPAQ stock crashes as soon as the Fisker merger is complete.Companies prop up their stock price in the first few months following a SPAC merger via “lockups” that prevent insiders from selling shares in the public market. These lockup periods for SPACs typically last between 180 days and a year from the initial merger date.After the lockup period expires, company insiders are free to sell shares at will. Most insiders don’t rush to dump their shares at the first opportunity. But for tech startups like Fisker, founded just 13 years ago, relatively young insiders have the change to become instant millionaires just by selling their shares. Even if they believe in the company’s long-term success, that is an extremely strong temptation.So far I’ve discussed a couple of general reasons to avoid overhyped listings like Spartan. However, there are also some industry-specific reasons to be skeptical of SPAQ stock.Fisker expects to generate just $600 million in revenue in 2022. Investors need to understand just how small that number is. In the most recent quarter alone, Tesla generated $8.7 billion in revenue. General Motors (NYSE:GM) generated $137.2 billion in revenue in 2019.To put that in perspective, Fisker is hoping that two years from now its business will be 0.4% the size of GM’s.Fisker management is brilliant for going public in the middle of an EV bubble. That’s the best time for companies to come to the market. Sell your company when its valuation is at its highest. But it’s obviously not a good time to be buying.SPAQ stock buyers that got in after the stock spiked following the Fisker news a few months ago already understand the power of hype. The stock is now down 40% since July 10.“I think buying new offerings during hot periods in the market … I don’t think it’s anything the average person should think about at all,” legendary investor Warren Buffett once said.I wholeheartedly agree.SPAQ stock may take off once the Fisker merger is wrapped up. But with so much noise associated with EVs and SPACs in the market these days, buying an overhyped SPAC EV company with virtually no sales in the current climate is a gamble, at best.“You can go around making dumb bets and win … It’s not something you want to take as a lifetime policy, though,” Buffett has said.If you genuinely believe SPAQ stock will be the next Tesla, be patient for now. There’s nothing wrong with watching the stock from the sidelines for a year and picking a good entry point once the excitement has died down. That strategy has worked since July. It will likely continue to work at least between now and the company’s lockup expiration.And remember — investors who bought Tesla a year after its IPO paid a split-adjusted price of about $5.52. Those investors missed out on the risk associated with the first year of trading. Nine years later, they are doing just fine.On the date of publication, Wayne Duggan held long positions in GM and BABA.Wayne Duggan has been a U.S. News & World Report Investing contributor since 2016 and is a staff writer at Benzinga, where he has written more than 7,000 articles.

76,"Oct 28, 2020 3:20PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFor speculators looking to chase the hottest megatrends, SPI Energy (NASDAQ:SPI) may look like a surefire winner. But, ignore the press releases, and look at the details, with SPI Energy stock.What am I talking about? The company, via its recent dabbling into cannabis, crypto, as well as electric vehicles (EVs), is looking to be a “jack of all trades, master of none” situation. That is to say, it’s getting into hot sectors with little experience. Granted, each of these sectors is set to grow massively in the coming decade.This company’s “throw darts at a board” strategy could pay off. Then again, based on its plethora of red flags, coupled with history of eroding shareholder value, chances aren’t it won’t. That means a potential drop from today’s prices ($8.30 per share), all the way back to around $1 per share.Granted, continued “green wave” enthusiasm could help support shares. But, given there’s better ways out there to play the solar and EV megatrends, it’s best to skip out on this play.Until recently, SPI was basically a solar company dabbling in hot markets like crypto and cannabis. But on Sep 23, to say shares went parabolic would be an understatement. As our own David Moadel wrote Oct 20, shares soared to prices as high as $46.67 per share, on news of the company’s entry into the EV business.Of course, speculators came to their senses (somewhat), and shares sold off from there. Yet, despite the questionable odds its recently formed EdisonFuture unit becomes the next Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), SPI Energy stock remains over 800% above prior price levels.This isn’t the first time SPI has dived into a hot sector. Last year, the company entered the industrial hemp and CBD business, via a partnership with the Navajo Nation. And, before that, the company made a big move into the cryptocurrency space, as our own Josh Enomoto noted earlier this month.Is this sexy diversification good for SPI Energy? Based on its income statement, perhaps it should put all its eggs in the solar basket, and watch that basket. Burning through cash for years, it’s been dependent on stock sales and convertible debt offerings to keep the lights on.And, while 2020’s been a great year for even the most speculative of securities, that doesn’t mean this stock can remain a winner for much longer. Looking at its past performance, as well as recent “short report,’ it’s doubtful “this time, it’s different.”It’s safe to say this year hasn’t been the most kind to short-sellers. Even the most vocal shorts, with extensive research to back their bear cases, have seen big losses and heavy regret. This activist short-seller called out Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) back in December, when it traded for around $3 per share. Where does PLUG stock trade today? Shares are up five-fold since that bear’s scathing report.Yet, while I have my own bearish reservations about that company, its red flags pale in comparison to the major concerns with this stock. With this in mind, a recent “short report” from another vocal short-seller may be barking up the right tree.This month, Grizzly Research (which is short SPI Energy stock), made the case why this company remains a “perpetual pump and dump.” In the full 18-page report, Grizzly provides more than enough rationale to build a bear case.What are the key takeaways from the report?Firstly, according to Grizzly, the crpyto units has never been operational, and the hemp/CBD unit is set to be shuttered. Secondly, its EV prospects don’t look all too bright. The company’s Chinese EV partner (Shaanxi Tongjia) suspended operations a year ago. Thirdly, the company is at risk of losing control over its Solar Juice Australia unit, which makes up 82.3% of its revenue.Granted, as an activist short-seller, it’s in Grizzly’s interest to make the company look as bad as possible. But, this plethora of red flags, combined with the stock’s atrocious performance since 2016 (when it traded as high as $160 per share), should give you pause.With its interest in solar, and now EVs, speculators may see opportunity with this recently “too hot to touch” play. But, diving into the details, it’s clear there’s more sizzle than steak here.Granted, in today’s market, betting against hyped-up stocks isn’t worth the risk. But, if you are looking for “green wave” exposure, skip out on SPI Energy stock, and pursue more solid opportunities elsewhere.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.Thomas Niel, contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single stock analysis since 2016.The post More Hype Than Substance, Steer Clear of SPI Energy Stock appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/more-hype-than-substance-steer-clear-of-spi-energy-stock-2020-10-28

77,"Oct 28, 2020 12:12PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith demand for electrical-vehicle (EV) chargers set to soar in coming years and Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK) stock trading at a relatively reasonable market capitalization, the shares could rally over the longer term.The company does, however, have one important red flag and a significant weakness which investors should weigh.Amid rapidly increasing adoption of EVs, demand for chargers will likely increase rapidly in the coming years. In a  note to investors on Sept. 24, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas  predicted that EV use would increase “at a 20% {compund annual growth rate} through 2040.”Jonas also noted that California Governor Gavin Newsom recently issued an executive order making all gasoline-powered cars and pickup trucks illegal as of 2035. According to the analyst, the state on its own has the fifth largest GDP in the world. This makes Newsom’s decision important for the EV sector.Moreover, in a previous article on Blink’s larger rival, ChargePoint Inc.,  I noted that “According to one forecast, U.S. EV sales are expected to soar from 383,000 in 2019 to 2.35 million in 2027.”Of course, many owners of those EVs would, at times, like the convenience of charging their vehicles at stations that are available to the general public. For example, during  road trips, public charging stations would, of course, be quite convenient. And for those who EV owners live in apartment buildings, public charging stations are a necessity, since an automobile cannot be brought into an apartment.Indeed, earlier this month, Blink announced that it had  placed 40 of its chargers in a single apartment building in Los Angeles. That’s an indication of how lucrative the apartment-building market could eventually become for Blink.And, as I pointed out in my article on ChargePoint, increased competition for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and faster chargers should also lift demand for public EV chargers in coming years.A Seeking Alpha columnist recently warned that the company’s margins are negative, indicating that it may never be profitable. But in actuality, Blink’s gross margins have been positive this year, coming in between 10% and 20%. That suggests that, as the company’s sales climb, its overall profit will increase, assuming that its marketing and administrative costs do not jump dramatically.Additionally, as demand for public chargers climb, Blink should be able to meaningfully increase its prices.But the Seeking Alpha columnist did bring up a lawsuit against Blink Charging which alleges that it “vastly overstate[d] the size, functionality, usage, and economic potential” of the company’s chargers. Specifically, the plaintiffs contend that “the majority of Blink’s stations are damaged, neglected, or non-functional,” according to the author. Blink has denied exaggerating the size of its charger network.The lawsuit may be frivolous, but it could very well have some merit. If it’s true that many of Blink’s stations are defective,  that of course reflects very badly on the company. Even worse, to the extent that Blink misrepresented the condition of its charging network. It may not be trustworthy going forward.And finally, the Seeking Alpha columnist pointed out that Blink has very little cash. Indeed, according to Yahoo Finance, it had only $4 million of cash as of the end of the second quarter. Although its debt, which stood at just $1 million as of the end of Q2, is very low,  it may have to, given its negative cash flow, issue more shares of BLNK stock in the medium term to stay afloat. When companies issue new stock, their stock prices tend to drop.Blink has a big opportunity. And since the market capitalization of BLNK stock is only $273 million, the shares can rise dramatically if the company executes well.But in light of the accusations made in the lawsuit against the company and its small amount of cash, I think that investors are much better off buying Switchback Energy (NYSE:SBE) stock, which is slated to be taken over by ChargePoint towards the end of 2020.In my research, I did not come across any major weaknesses or red flags involving ChargePoint.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. Larry has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 13 years.

78,"Oct 28, 2020 10:13AM EDT","JD.com (NASDAQ: JD), China's biggest direct online retailer, is set to become the first company in the world to deploy an autonomous delivery vehicle program at scale. The company says it's operating an autonomous delivery robot project in Changshu, Jiangsu province, China, and plans to have 100 autonomous delivery robots in operation in the city by year's end.JD, which is sometimes referred to as the Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) of China, runs its own fulfillment network and third-party marketplace in China, in addition to direct online sales. But the comparison with Amazon often understates the advances the Chinese company has made in areas like fulfillment, grocery sales, and automation, where JD has been consistently ahead of Amazon. In 2017, JD opened a fully automated warehouse in Shanghai that requires just four workers but ships 200,000 packages a day. Now, the company has raised the bar again in automation, setting up the world's first Level 4 autonomous vehicle network. Image source: JD.com.At its Global Smart Supply Chain Summit earlier this month, JD announced that it would have a network of 100 Level 4 delivery vehicles operating in Changshu by the end of the year. The company first put this self-driving vehicle on the road in Wuhan in February to help facilitate contactless delivery to hospitals and residences. JD's autonomous vehicle in Wuhan logged nearly 4,000 miles and delivered more than 13,000 packages in a 107-day deployment, and the company says the technology is now ready to be scaled. The company developed the core of its autonomous driving system in-house, and the current robot is the result of several iterations after it first deployed an autonomous delivery vehicle in 2016. Level 4 automation is generally defined as self-driving without a driver, but only within a specific mapped area, known as geofencing. The reliance on geofencing makes package deliveries in a city an ideal application for Level 4 technology. Other conditions, like severe weather, can also limit Level 4 autonomous vehicles. JD's autonomous vehicles drive themselves from destination to destination and notify customers with texts and phone calls that include a verification code to ensure packages are given to the proper recipient. Delivery demand in China has boomed during the pandemic, as China's equivalent to the postal service reportedly delivered more than 60 billion packages year-to-date through Oct. 18. According to the company, JD's robots can both alleviate capacity concerns and assist human couriers. JD expects to have more than 100,000 automated delivery robots on the road within five years, making them a key part of its logistics infrastructure. JD Logistics CEO Zhenwui Wang said: ""We will continue to increase the investment in logistics technology and we will also make logistics technologies available to the general public, facilitating social infrastructure upgrades.""A woman receiving a package from a JD robot. Source: JD.comIt's easy to see the direct benefits of the automated delivery vehicles. They can help JD save on labor costs and expand capacity, especially as such vehicles could be operated 24 hours a day. The company also says that their power consumption is just 10% of the industry average, or the equivalent of a standard light bulb. Being able to deploy a network of the vehicles should also make JD even more appealing as a third-party logistics provider, potentially allowing it to charge lower prices. Or it could license the technology, as Wang alluded to in the quotation above. Third-party logistics is already one of the company's fastest-growing businesses, as the segment saw 54% revenue growth through the first half of 2020, to $2.2 billion.It's also notable that JD is the first company to roll out a scalable network of Level 4 vehicles, beating Amazon, which recently acquired AV tech company Zoox, known for developing robotaxi technology, and agreed to buy 100,000 electric vehicles from Rivian. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), meanwhile, has long promised to roll out or enable a fleet of ""robotaxis,"" but has yet to do so, though it just introduced its full-self-driving beta, which is currently meant to be used with driver supervision. Its vehicles offer a number of self-driving features under its ""autopilot,"" generally considered to be between Level 2 and Level 3.Despite JD's technology advances, investors continue to underestimate the potential of the stock. JD.com is also at the forefront in areas like drone delivery, further boosting its logistics capabilities. The Chinese tech stock  trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 36 based on next year's expected earnings, barely more expensive than the S&P 500 and much cheaper than Amazon and Tesla. Considering its momentum coming out of the pandemic, logistics prowess, growth potential in multiple areas, and its technological innovations, JD stock looks poised for serious long-term gains.10 stocks we like better than JD.comWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

80,"Oct 28, 2020 8:15AM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere are a number of ways to play Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) for one simple reason: it’s almost impossible to know exactly how the SPCE stock story will play out.Certainly, Virgin Galactic has a massive opportunity. “Space tourism” is likely to be a big business. The company will begin by targeting individuals with a net worth of $10 million or higher. That’s a bigger market than one might think: Virgin has estimated there are two million such individuals worldwide. Explosive growth in developing markets like China and India may only add to that total.That’s not Virgin Galactic’s only opportunity, either. The same research and development efforts used to drive manned spaceflight could lead to hypersonic travel here on Earth as well. One analyst believes hypersonic travel could be a $1 trillion market by the middle of this century.Of course, there’s no shortage of risks. Hypersonic travel is far from a sure bet. One tragic accident could impair the Virgin Galactic brand permanently. Competition will be intense. And investor patience over the years it will take just to get to positive earnings, let alone significant profits, will wax and wane.As I wrote earlier this year, SPCE stock is one to buy only with money an investor can afford to lose. With the stock up 64% since then, the advice is even more true.But what’s fun about Virgin Galactic stock — beyond “owning a little bit of a spaceship company”, as Virgin founder Richard Branson put it — is that the length of its timeline allows for multiple investing strategies. Each has its own risk and reward. It’s up to each investor to determine which one fits best.This is my preferred strategy toward SPCE stock at the moment. Virgin Galactic remains years away from driving a profit. The company doesn’t have the market to itself. Private spaceflight companies include Blue Origin, backed by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos; SpaceX, led by Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) chief executive officer Elon Musk; and Momentus, which is going public via a so-called “SPAC merger” with Stable Road Acquisition (NASDAQ:SRAC).SRAC stock actually highlights the potential for a pullback in SPCE. Virgin Galactic, too, used a SPAC (special purpose acquisition company) to go public. But whereas that merger drew optimism, SRAC stock trades barely above the $10 merger price.To be fair, Momentus and Virgin Galactic serve different aspects of the market; Momentus is a “space delivery company.” But the lack of enthusiasm in a SPAC group that has often seen enormous post-merger returns (as seen in the likes of Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) and DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG), to name just two) suggests that perhaps investor eyes are beyond space for the time being.Indeed, even SPCE stock has pulled back rather sharply of late. And so, the case for simply waiting is that a better price is likely to be on offer at some point. Virgin Galactic still is years away from turning a profit. Investors at the moment have little information on what the space market as a whole will look like. In that context, it’s reasonable to ask: what’s the rush?Of course, if there’s no rush, investors can also use options to play SPCE stock. Options are not suitable for all investors, and those investors must understand the trade fully before putting it on.But SPCE seems a strong candidate for either a cash-secured put or a covered call. These are essentially the same trade. In both, investors are selling off potential upside while receiving upfront cash that minimizes the downside.For Virgin Galactic, an investor could buy SPCE stock at $18 (as of this writing). She could then sell a call option with a 19 strike that expires Jan. 15, 2021, for almost $3.The option limits downside: she is paying a net of a little over $15 per share for the stock. But it also limits upside. If SPCE clears $19, the option will be exercised and the stock will be sold at that price.Of course, that’s not a terrible outcome. The investor sells the stock for almost $22 ($19 strike price + $3 premium), making a profit in the range of 20%. If the stock falls below $16, the investor would have been better off simply waiting.So, these are not risk-free trades. But an investor can create a scenario where the downside in the trade is owning SPCE at a price she would be happy to pay.The other risk, admittedly, is that Virgin Galactic stock (pardon the pun) takes off, leading the investor to miss out on a big rally. But that kind of move may be unlikely given that SPCE has traded (mostly) sideways for months now, and given the lack of significant, potentially perception-changing news until 2022 at the earliest.There’s a simpler way to go: just buy the stock.I don’t believe that’s a bad choice. Again, there’s big risk here, and investors need to size their position accordingly. The bull case is that the company succeeds and is worth tens of billions of dollars, against a current market capitalization barely above $4 billion.But as Branson himself pointed out, owning SPCE stock is kind of fun. It’s exciting to own “a spaceship company.” It might be exciting for a young family member interested in space to be gifted the stock as well.Personally, were I to take a long position, I’d probably get cute with options and try to lower my long-term cost basis. But, if investors are willing to take on the risk and willing to be patient, SPCE stock remains an intriguing long-term play, even at a relatively higher price.It’s worth noting that there’s a bearish option as well: shorting SPCE stock or buying put options that bet on its decline.This is a risky strategy, for a number of reasons. Most notably, shorting any stock can be dangerous, since losses are theoretically infinite. They can exceed 100%. Put options in SPCE aren’t cheap, and in the near-term have a high risk of being zeroed out.But there is a short case, and indeed about 27% of Virgin Galactic’s floated shares are sold short. (That adds to the danger of shorting, as high short interest can lead to a short squeeze.) Again, it’s possible that over time SPCE stock winds up going to zero. In the interim, the chart does not look particularly attractive; it looks right now like SPCE is following a past pattern of rallies fizzling out before the stock heads back to $15.And, again, it probably takes just one adverse event to significantly impair the bull case. A failed launch or a lost ship would cost the company millions of dollars it would have to recoup through selling more stock. It would also damage the brand, and the hopes that Virgin Galactic can transform how, and where, humans travel. There is a short case here.To be clear, I’m not recommending this strategy. I’m certainly not following this strategy. But the fact that many traders are is a reminder of the risks, both short term and long term, that surround this intriguing and high-reward stock.On the date of publication, Vince Martin did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The post 4 Different Ways to Play Virgin Galactic Stock appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-different-ways-to-play-virgin-galactic-stock-2020-10-28

81,"Oct 28, 2020 6:00AM EDT","By Paul LienertDETROIT, Oct 28 (Reuters) - General Motors Co's GM.N Super Cruise once again edged Tesla's TSLA.O Autopilot in an evaluation of 17 vehicles equipped with active driving assistance systems (ADAS) by Consumer Reports, the testing organization said on Wednesday.A Tesla Model Y fitted with Autopilot finished ""a distant second,"" the group said, to a Cadillac CT6 equipped with Super Cruise, which GM is rolling out to more than 20 vehicles - including its new Hummer electric pickup truck  - over the next three years.Safety and insurance researchers have frequently warned of the risks of consumers overestimating ADAS systems' abilities, a misconception increased by some automakers calling their products Autopilot, ProPilot or Co-Pilot. In 2018, the Cadillac CT6 with Super Cruise scored higher than a Tesla Model 3 with Autopilot, in a Consumer Reports test of just four vehicles equipped with ADAS.In the latest test, conducted this summer on a track and on public roads, the Cadillac scored 69 points out of a possible 100, while the Tesla scored 57. A Lincoln Corsair equipped with Ford Motor Co's F.N Co-Pilot 360 system, finished third with 52.The critical difference in the Super Cruise system is a driver-facing infrared camera to make sure he or she is paying attention to the road and is ready to take over manual control when necessary, said Kelly Funkhouser, head of connected and automated vehicle testing at Consumer Reports.The group noted that Autopilot can shut off abruptly in some situations, while Super Cruise did a better job of notifying the driver when the system is disengaging.In recent European safety testing, a Tesla Model 3 with Autopilot placed sixth out of 10 systems, getting high marks for performance and ability to respond to emergencies, but falling short on its ability to maintain a driver’s focus on the road.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.See the 10 stocksStock Advisor returns as of 2/1/20This video was recorded on October 22, 2020.Chris Hill: It's Thursday, October 22nd. Welcome to MarketFoolery. I'm Chris Hill, with me today, Mr. Jason Moser. Good to see you my friend.Jason Moser: Good to see you.Hill: We've got -- I said it before, it's my favorite time of year, and it comes four times a year, we got earnings season heating up. We got Chipotle (NYSE: CMG), we got Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), we're going to perform an autopsy on Quibi.Let's start with Tesla, though. Tesla reported a profit in the third quarter that was higher than Wall Street was expecting, and this is the fifth quarter in a row that Tesla has delivered a profit. Stock up about 5% this morning. It was one of those things where the lightbulb went off above my head this morning, Jason. It was like the fifth quarter in a row, profits, earnings... oh, wait! they have a P/E ratio now, I wonder what it is, and it's just shy of 1,100.Moser: Oh, I mean, I guess the market is just pulling forward some very robust expectations, let's just maybe leave it at that. You know, I don't have a dog in this hunt, so to speak, I don't own Tesla shares, I've not recommended it, I've not short it, I enjoy following this business, learning from it and there's some entertainment value there for sure. The core business here is just really so simple, right? I mean, they make cars and they sell them to people. And yet it's such a sideshow to the distractions and the drama with analysts, they're so dead-set on one position or the other. I mean, you go on Twitter, and it's just this back-and-forth that never ends. And honestly, it's like DC, I mean, nobody is going to budge, right?But to your point, fifth consecutive quarter of profitability. Yeah, we could sit there and argue about how they got to profitability, and I'll note that regulatory credits, I think, are probably a big question that a lot of folks will continue to harp on, how important are they. I think in regard to Tesla's business, regulatory credits are very important, but that shouldn't be a surprise. That's how you incentivize moving an entire society over to a new technology like this that we're so reliant on in transportation.And so, this year so far, they've taken advantage of about $1.2 billion in those credits, and that clearly affects profitability, that's good for them. But I don't hold that against them, because they're just playing the hand that they were dealt, they are playing with the rules of the game more or less. If you compare that to last year at this time, they claimed about $460 million in credit. So, clearly a considerable amount more in credits this year than last, and I'm sure that's something that we'll continue to see them take advantage of to the extent they can. But I mean, they produced just over 145,000 vehicles, they delivered almost 140,000.And I think, while Musk certainly loves to aim high, and I think he should, their 500,000 deliveries for the year remains a target. Now, that is a high goal. That's a lofty goal. They need about 180,000 to go. They need about 180,000 this final quarter. Maybe they get there, maybe they don't, but I think the more time goes on, the more we're seeing the market is willing to give this business time to do its thing. And not every business out there can claim that luxury, but you see companies like Amazon, for the longest time, the market really gave Bezos the leash to run with that business and build it. You see the same thing happening here.So, I'm for the business, I love what he's trying to do, I think it's funny to listen to just people go back-and-forth on the valuation and whatnot, but here we are and this is clearly a business that's making a big impact in the world.Hill: Yeah, there are definitely a couple of analysts, I was watching on CNBC this morning, who are bearish on Tesla. And they're getting kind of worked up. [laughs] It was just one of those things where I felt a little bad for them, I don't know, I mean ...Moser: And like I said, I don't dive into that discussion because it's just so unproductive. So, I'd say the one thing, like, if you look at where they are today in regard to the balance sheet. I mean, they're quarter in, they're cash equivalents jumped from $6 billion to $14.5 billion. Now, remember they had a capital raise here recently; I think they raised around $5 billion. If I had one piece of advice for Elon Musk -- and listen, Chris, I'm a dummy, OK, I know that. I mean, he's not asking me for advice, but if I were to give him one piece of advice. You know, like we've talked before about Tom Gardner's philosophy on your holding period, right? However long you plan to hold a stock, just, boom! Automatically double that, right, double that holding period and you'll benefit from it. I feel like any time he wants to raise money, double it, because it's just clear as day that any lever he wants to pull, he's going to be able to raise that money without too much trouble. And particularly where the stock is today, I mean, if he gets to a point where he needs to raise more capital, and he probably will, I mean, he sees the energy business ultimately being as large as the vehicle business one day, and that's going to require a lot of investment too. Yeah, anytime you're ready to raise some money, just go ahead and double it. I think that would be a nice rule of thumb.Hill: Third quarter profits and revenue for Chipotle came in higher than expected. Same-store sales were north of 8%, and Chipotle's digital sales tripled year-over-year. And despite all that, shares down more than 5%. What is going on here, did Brian Niccol say something on the call?Moser: [laughs] No, no, no, no. I think there are a couple of things that are probably coming into play here. No. 1, I think it's probably selling a little bit on valuation, in that, the stock is trading for over 120X full-year earnings estimates. I mean, this is still a burrito company basically at the end of the day. So, you know, +120X, that's a pretty expensive burrito, so to speak. So, I think there's probably a little bit of selling on the valuation side of it, but there's also some concern there. And fair concern, I think, in the delivery, and we'll talk about that in a minute. But I do think it's just amazing.I was thinking about this yesterday, the Chipotle story, it's amazing to watch here over the last several years, because they went from a restaurant that really couldn't stop from getting people sick to now being, like, one of the best operators in the entire space during a pandemic where a lot of people are getting sick. So, just hats off to Brian Niccol, the CEO. I think he's just done such a good job with this business since he took over, and it goes to show you the value in hiring folks with a lot of industry expertise like he has coming over from Taco Bell. So, for what it's worth, I think they made a great call on the CEO side.But when you start looking at the numbers, I mean, it really does feel like Chipotle is turning into Domino's, it's really interesting to see. They have over 17 million loyalty program members now versus just 7 million a year ago. And that's all thanks, really, to a very strong app. And if you looked [laughs] on the call, as I did, the word ""delivery"" was mentioned 45 times on yesterday's earnings call. A year ago, it was mentioned six times. And I think that is potentially a source of some market concern as well, because when you look at delivery, the digital sales numbers were really impressive, they grew over 200%. They represented close to 50% of sales. About half of digital was delivery, and the concern there, and they note this. And so, I want to read this exactly as they noted.But here's the crux of it, they say the amount that we remit to our delivery partner for sale through our app and website is higher than what we collect from customers and is included in other operating costs. So, delivery is something that is, yeah, it's driving the topline maybe a little bit, but it's also something tampering profitability. And they're going to have to figure out a way to square that at some point, but for now, they're doing a really good job in the face of what is a very difficult restaurant space, utilizing that delivery lever, really growing that part of the business. I don't hold that against them, I understand maybe a little bit of the concern in the near-term, but I think that when you look at all of these numbers put together, you still have to be very bullish on this company's future.Hill: We've talked before about the opportunity they have in terms of expansion, to grow their footprint. Gary Kelly, the CEO of Southwest Airlines, was talking this morning about corporate travel and how he thinks that's going to take 10 years for corporate travel to fully recover for the airline industry. David Chang, the restaurateur and chef was tweeting this morning about how the restaurant industry is tied to corporate business. And you know, putting those two together and, in particular, David Chang's comments, it really does seem like a longer opportunity for that type of investment for Chipotle to grow its footprint.Moser: Yeah. I absolutely agree. I mean, I think they've done a very good job of not trying to expand too quickly, that can be one of the dangers of franchising is that it gives you the opportunity to grow really quickly, but sometimes that can be a little bit of an anchor on you if times are a little tougher. And so, they opened 44 new restaurants during the quarter, and closed only three. They have just over 2,700 stores today, and most of them are all open.Since sales really hit their low in March, they've been able to retain, they said, 80% to 85% of the digital sales gains, while recovering about 50% to 55% of their in-store sales. So, again, I think that when you see how they're slowly and methodically growing that footprint and then they're also making sure that they utilize that physical store footprint for more than just the in-store dining experience or even picking up for that matter, again, I go back to Domino's, and really one of the things that Domino's really done so well through the years is utilizing that physical footprint to essentially offer two different businesses, right, it's a pickup and it's a delivery. And I think that Chipotle is really starting to exploit that as well.And if you do it right, if you do it well, it can be really, really valuable over many years. And Domino's investors, you know what I'm talking about. If you held on that [laughs] stock for the last +10 years, you are just loving life. Now, I'm not saying Chipotle will be Domino's, it's pizza versus burritos, and probably a little bit of a different market opportunity there, but I think that Chipotle is going to continue to be able to focus on the core Mexican food business for some time to come. And at 2,700 stores today, you know, they're going to keep on opening up 100 new stores a year here-and-there for the foreseeable future. And so, for investors, you have to love that, because now we're going to see two different drivers of sales from not only the store itself, but also the delivery model that they'll perfect that, they'll get it down, and it'll become something that's a bit more profitable and meaningful to the bottom-line, it's just going to take a little time.Hill: Six months after its launch in April, Quibi, the short-video streaming service, is being shut down due to a complete lack of interest. The company was started all the way back in August of 2018 by Jeffrey Katzenberg and Meg Whitman. They raised $1.75 billion and then proceeded to light that money on fire. Where do you want to begin with this guy, because one thought I had, and we were chatting a little bit about this yesterday, is that capitalism works. Like, among other things, this is an example of capitalism working. They built this thing, they spent a lot of money to do it, they put it out there, and everyone collected and said ""no.""Moser: Yeah, I mean, you're absolutely right. This is a great example of capitalism working. And there are a lot of different ways to go with this. And I don't want to make light of the fact that people are losing their jobs from this, though, I will say that even for the most glass half full person, jumping on board with this entity, you had to probably feel like the chances of success were going to be lower than 50%, I would have assumed, but it seemed like it was a little bit obvious all of us in the analyst community. But it was amazing to me, I read in one of the articles that during a video call with employees, Katzenberg actually suggested that staffers listen to the song Get Back Up Again from the Trolls film to buoy their spirits. I mean, it's like he's still talking to his own booking, [laughs] he's getting ready to lay a bunch of people off is what it sounded like. But it was very odd, like, I don't know, I feel like, it just didn't seem to me to be as sympathetic as probably it could have been.But we talked about this a few shows ago, right, a few weeks back, where I don't think anyone, including Jeffrey Katzenberg, really knew what Quibi was supposed to be. I mean, is it social, is it streaming, is it social streaming? I mean, there were already all sorts of competitors out there in that space to some extent. And so, sometimes, in investing, like we say, sometimes investing, you just have to be able to call the mistake, admit it, move on, as opposed to just keeping on burning money. And it sounds like in this case, I mean, they burned through their capital, and that was basically that. And I think the writing is on the wall. It sounded like a lot of Hollywood was doubtful to begin with, interestingly enough, they didn't have a problem selling [laughs] content, they're like, hey, sure, we'll sell it to you, but we don't think you're going to succeed.So, listen, when you jump into a crowded space like this, and video streaming is a crowded space, obviously, you need to differentiate yourself, you need to innovate, do something different, and it just didn't seem like they did that, like, at all. And you know, speaking of Seinfeld, it reminded me of that reservation's episode of Seinfeld, it all comes back to Seinfeld, Chris. But it's like, you say you know how to get in there, differentiate or innovate, but you don't actually know how to do it. Saying it doesn't mean that you're doing it. And it didn't feel like they really had come to that realization until it was just way too late.Hill: So, one of the thoughts I've had about all this is, I feel like we need to come up with a new word to replace the word ""unicorn"" as it is used in the world of investing. And for those unfamiliar, a unicorn is a private company that reaches a private market valuation of $1 billion. And I was thinking about something Emily Flippen said on the show a few weeks back where she made the comment like, the world is only getting bigger, we're only going to have more companies with $1 trillion market caps in the future, not fewer. And so, as things continue, I think we need to come up with a different -- because, you know, that was part of it, that's like, oh! look at this company, they've raised nearly $2 billion, you know? What would this be worth in the open market? That's like, well, it turns out zero. So, yeah ...Moser: Yeah, I look at some of these capital raises with some of these businesses, and it's astounding the money that some of these businesses raise. And it's just astounding, I mean, it's breathtaking, [laughs] like you said. Look at Robinhood, for example. With all of the trouble and issues that they continue to have, I don't know why anybody who's getting started investing today, why would you use Robinhood, because every other platform could basically match what they're doing for the most part and it's going to be a more robust and, frankly, trustworthy platform. And yet, this business continues to raise billions and billions of dollars, and it's garnered something like +$10 billion market valuation. Now, that to me seems really absurd, but it just goes to show, man, there are some very deep pockets when it comes to these VC interests and investors who aren't necessarily participating in the public markets. And I think the thing is, in most cases it's really all about hitting a couple of homeruns as opposed to trying to get, like, 60% of your picks right. I think most people know that they're not going to be getting 60% of those picks right, it's really just about finding a couple of grand slams that can make a big impact.Hill: Yeah. I mean, the unicorn is an incredibly rare creature, and private market valuations of $1 billion are becoming increasingly less rare. I'll tell you what is really a unicorn, it's something like Quibi, something that from day one, we all sort of looked at and we're like, I don't think that's going to work, and then every step along the way, like, yeah, no, it's still not working. The launch isn't going well, they're burning cash, like, oh, my God! They're exploring strategic alternatives. Oh, they're dead.Like, I can't think of another time when, you know, there was a business -- you know, maybe Pets.com back in the day, but ...Moser: [laughs] It feels like there are always going to be those examples. That's why this job is so fun, because we get to see this stuff every day. I mean, the market, at the end of the day, we said it, it's just like a really big disagreement. And both parties think they're right for whatever reasons, and you have to figure out a way to reconcile that and choose a side. I think we chose ours on this one very early on.Hill: Yeah, if only we had a chance to short it. All right. We'll wrap up there. Jason, always great talking to you.

83,"Oct 27, 2020 3:49PM EDT","Privately held SpaceX is ready to open up the beta testing of its Starlink satellite internet service, and has sent emails offering consumers who have expressed interest a chance to sign up for service.The email, which was posted on Reddit Monday, said the service requires $499 in up-front costs to cover a user terminal, mounting tripod, and router, as well as $99 per month in user fees. There appear to be no data caps, though Starlink admits the initial product might not be of the quality SpaceX hopes to eventually roll out to the masses.Image source: Getty Images.Starlink is calling the offer its ""better than nothing"" beta test, and admitted in the email ""we are trying to lower your initial expectations.""""Expect to see data speeds vary from 50Mb/s to 150Mb/s and latency from 20ms to 40ms over the next several months as we enhance the Starlink system,"" the email said. ""There will also be brief periods of no connectivity at all.""At those speeds and latency, the service would be most useful to those who are unable to get broadband service from terrestrial providers.Starlink is an ambitious plan by Elon Musk's SpaceX to launch a fleet of more than 12,000 satellites to blanket the globe with internet service. The project is expected to cost more than $10 billion to build out, but SpaceX has said it believes the business could generate upward of $30 billion per year once it is fully established.SpaceX so far has launched only about 900 satellites, and the beta trial according to reports will be limited primarily to locations near the northern U.S. border.The service is aimed primarily at rural households in the U.S., where terrestrial options are limited. It's possible the overall cost of the service will come down post-beta as terminal manufacturing increases, but given the high costs, the service for now will likely struggle to compete against other high-speed options.SpaceX officials have discussed the idea of eventually spinning Starlink out as a separate, publicly traded company, potentially creating a new tech stock focused on internet delivery.10 stocks we like better than WalmartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.See the 10 stocks *Stock Advisor returns as of October 20, 2020 This video was recorded on October 23, 2020.Chris Hill: We begin with a couple big names in technology both down around 10% this week. Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) data center business was weak in the third quarter and that brought the stock down on Friday. You tell me, Jason, how bad is this?Jason Moser: Well, I mean, it could be worse, it's obviously not been a very good year to-date for Intel. Their transition from being a PC-based company to becoming a data-centric company is certainly presenting its fair share of challenges. Now with that said, as much pessimism that is out there right now, there could actually be a value play developing here for you value investors out there. So, Ron, take note.Ron Gross: [laughs] I got my pen.Moser: As you mentioned, Chris, data-centric revenue $8.5 billion; that was down 10% from a year ago. And they attributed a lot of that to COVID-related weaknesses. PC-centric revenue was basically flat; nothing really to write home about. But the thing is, if you go back just a quarter ago to July, they recorded 34% growth in the data-centric side of the business, PC-centric grew 7%. So, clearly, they're running into some headwinds there. They're seeing some weakness in the Internet of Things department there. Revenue fell 33%, operating income down 80%. Again, they're attributing all of this related to COVID-related demand. And there's something to that, but remember they also remain behind the pack on that 7nm chip, pushing that farther and farther out. And so, I think that you've got this sort of confluence of events here where there's potentially going to be more consolidation in the space. You've got Nvidia and Arm merging. Rumors floating around of a potential tie between AMD and Xilinx. They're going through a rough stretch, but again, I think this is temporary, it seems like a timing thing. It's a big company with a lot of capabilities, so they're down but I wouldn't count them out yet.Hill: Shares of Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) are up more than 200% over the past year, but they gave some of that back this week. Third quarter profits came in lower than expected and subscriber growth for Netflix was the weakest in four years. Not great, Ron, but they seem like they're in better shape than Intel; and yes, I get that they're completely different businesses.Gross: [laughs] Completely different. For Netflix, it's all about that ability to maintain growth, especially when you're trading at 55X earnings. So, they ended just 2.2 million new subscribers in the third quarter; that's down 80% from the second quarter. Now, I don't think people should be surprised, because they told investors that the COVID boost of the second quarter was not going to follow through. So, the fact that it was down is not surprising. Revenue is still up 23%. Earnings per share still up 18%. The company continues to do really well, both internationally and domestically. Restarting content production is going to kind of ramp up the cost, that's going to bite into cash flow, free cash flow could be negative actually, as things start to ramp up but it's essential to ramp those up, because they've got to continue to produce original pieces of content to keep people coming in the doors. Pricing power still remains, it's still a relatively good bargain in my opinion, but competition is severe as more and more streaming services continue to, kind of, gain share, including folks like Disney+.So, I think Netflix is fine, I don't think it should have been a surprise that we saw subscriber growth come down. The stock is still up [laughs] 50% this year alone. So, I think everything remains on track.Hill: I agree with you about their pricing power, but you don't think they're thinking about raising that subscription price anytime soon, do you?Gross: I think that would be a mistake in this current environment, certainly there will be future price increases down the road. I wouldn't expect to see it, let's call it, within a year or even perhaps even longer. I think they'll sit at this price for now, but I do think, if they can continue to produce compelling content that folks really want to see, like, Stranger Things or whatever your favorite show is, that the pricing power does still exist.Hill: For the fifth quarter in a row Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) reported a profit, third quarter revenue came in at $8.8 billion, higher than Wall Street was expecting. And Jason, once again, no real fireworks on the conference call from Elon Musk.Moser: [laughs] No, but I'll tell you, Tesla and politics, man! This stuff, it gets people worked up, doesn't it? The core business of Tesla, they sell cars, it really is pretty simple, yet the drama really always takes center stage in regard to what Elon Musk may have said or promises [laughs] he may have made. I think the question for investors that comes out of this quarter, and I don't have a dog in this hunt, so to speak, but I think the question really, kind of, is revolving around regulatory credits and how important they are for this company. Because as they chalk up these profitable quarters, it's important to note that there is a regulatory credit aspect, the dynamic to that profitability, so that shouldn't be a surprise. I mean, that's how you incentivize the push, this big push toward electric vehicles, right? They're just playing with the rules that they've been given.But if you look at the numbers, they've taken advantage of about $1.2 billion in credits this year versus about $460 million at the same time a year ago. Again, I don't hold that against them, it just is what it is, so to speak. But if you look at the numbers, they produced just over 145,000 vehicles, delivered nearly a 140,000. They remain steadfast in their belief they can hit that 500,000 vehicle target by the end of the year, delivering 500,000 vehicles by the end of the year, that's a stretch goal for sure. I mean, they're going to have to bring about 180,000 deliveries this quarter, this final quarter of the year. But we know that Musk likes to aim high, and I certainly don't fault him for that, they're in good shape from a capital position right now with that recent raise. Balance sheet now has $14.5 billion or so. So, I think all in all it's a company that just keeps on doing the right things and it's working out for them.Hill: Shares of Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) up this week, despite the fact that its loss in the third quarter was the biggest loss Southwest has ever posted. Ron, why the optimism? [laughs]Gross: [laughs] You know, better than expected results, I would say, hopes for government stimulus, and perhaps some light at the end of the tunnel, if we look at maybe a year, [laughs] maybe even two years. But this quarter, obviously, it just remains brutal, kind of, across the whole sector. Revenue down 68%; operating revenue per average seat miles, [Revenue per Available Seat Mile] (sic) which is a common metric in the industry, RASM, often discussed, down 53%. So, you know, they lost over $1 billion, around $1.2 billion. Not much they really can do here, but they are taking some steps. They're seeing some modest improvement in leisure passenger traffic.Business, I think, is going to take longer. We saw United, American make comments about how business travel is going to take longer to come back. Everything is going to come back rather slowly. CEO Gary Kelly of Southwest said that until there's a widely available vaccine, they expect passenger traffic and booking trends to ""remain fragile."" [laughs] So, there is an operating metric for you, remaining fragile.They got their daily cash burn down to $12 million; I can't believe we're saying, you know, that's a pretty good situation, only burning $12 million a day. They expect that to continue into October. Listen, I think additional government stimulus would really help bridge the gap from here to where we hope they eventually will get. I assume we'll see something, timing, who knows. But you know, they're making moves, they're cutting costs, they're cutting, unfortunately, employees and furloughing folks when they need to. They're entering new markets. They entered nine new airports in recent months, including Miami, Chicago, O'Hare, Houston.Balance sheet is fine, $15 billion-ish in cash, only $10 billion or $11 billion in debt. I'm not worried about them with respect to something like a Chapter 11, but it's going to take a while for business to come back for sure.Hill: Well, and one more silver lining, not just for Southwest, but all the airlines is that, for all of the spread of the coronavirus that we've seen, the airlines have done well in that regard. We're seeing relatively few cases connected to air travel.Gross: Agreed. The movement of the air, the filtration systems are quite good. The mandating of masks certainly helps. We see Southwest just announced that they will go back to selling middle seats starting on December 1st. I think that's largely a result of what you just said that it seems that air passenger travel is relatively safe and they feel comfortable that they can do that without harming passengers.Hill: Shares of Chipotle (NYSE: CMG) went down this week, despite a third quarter that most restaurants would kill for. Profits and revenue came in higher than expected, digital sales tripled, Jason, come on!Moser: This is a strong quarter. I mean, think about the story, though. This is a company, this is a restaurant that went from, they couldn't keep from getting people sick in the good times, to a restaurant that is really one of the best operators in the space during a pandemic. [laughs] It's been a phenomenal, phenomenal turn of events. So, hats off to CEO Brian Niccol, because I think he's really done a wonderful job with the business. I think the selling really comes on valuation more than anything else, and one of the concerns in regard to delivery.The stock itself is trading over [laughs] 120X full-year earnings estimates. It's still a restaurant, they're just slinging burritos, Chris, it's not rocket science; we got to just keep that in mind. I'm a shareholder, so I'm happy about that.You mentioned digital sales, revenue was up 14%; digital sales were up 202%, accounting for almost half of total sales for the quarter. They have 17 million loyalty program members now versus 7 million a year ago. And to that point on delivery, it is a really big part of this business now. They mentioned it 45 times on the earnings call this week. And the problem is that it's the delivery service revenue in what they are collecting versus what they're having to shell out. And they mentioned it. They said the amount that we remit to our delivery partner for sales through our app and website is higher than what we collect from customers. So, it's good in that it's helping drive that topline growth and selling food, but it is coming in a little bit of a cost that's crimping margins.With that said, remember that with 2021 just around the corner here, you're looking at around $10 in earnings estimates for this year, that number is projected to double for 2021. So, assuming we get through this pandemic and things look better in 2021, there could be some pent-up demand, there's some coiled-spring earnings power coming this way for Chipotle.Gross: More importantly, have they gotten their queso act together yet finally, is the Queso Blanco here to stay?Moser: [laughs] I can't say that I've never tried it, Ron, I'm sorry to admit, but the guacamole is just so good; I always have to get the guacamole.Hill: Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) sales in the first quarter rose 9%. The company raised revenue guidance for the full fiscal year, and shares of the household goods giant hitting an all-time high this week, Ron.Gross: Definitely one of those companies that have been the beneficiary of COVID. You know, it's hard to say that, [laughs] but you know, the stay at home, the be safe, all of us hunkering down, really, is just accruing to, both, their top- and bottom-line. As you said, sales are up 9%. That's pretty strong for a company like Procter & Gamble. Strong demand for home, health hygiene products, not surprising, that's where I would have expected it to come from. Homecare was their strongest segment, up 14%; that's a very big number. Baby and family care, I guess, people are neglecting their babies nowadays, that was the weakest segment, only up 3%, but still up. So, certainly no signs of actual weakness to any major extent.Gross margins and operating margins both widened, so that really gives you a boost on the bottom-line. So, earnings per share were up 20%. Raised outlook. Sales growth expected to be 3% to 4%. Earnings growth of 4% to 9%. They returned $4 billion to shareholders; $2 billion of dividend payments, $2 billion in common stock repurchases. Things are going really well for Procter & Gamble. I don't think this continues into perpetuity, this is not a new Procter & Gamble, but they'll continue to benefit from the pandemic for a while.Hill: Well, we were talking earlier in the show about Netflix having pricing power, and you know, Procter & Gamble, they sell basic household items, they've got pricing power too and it showed up in this quarter.Gross: Yeah, for sure. Especially for things that people are clamoring for, which are those hygiene products, those household products, there is some room there to make a few more pennies here-and-there, and that's why you see the margins improve, which is profit that falls right down to the bottom-line.Hill: Shares of Boston Beer (NYSE: SAM) also hitting a new all-time high this week. Strong third quarter results fueled, once again, Jason, by sales of hard seltzer. We've seen this for a while now, the beer sales, the Samuel Adams sales falling a little bit, but the hard seltzer really making up for it.Gross: Yeah, you're right. I mean, talk about a business that's really flourishing during what's a tough time for a lot of other businesses. Boston Beer is really, really doing well here. And it's in the face of, as you noted, a beer business that's really continuing to suffer. And I actually don't know how relevant beer is going to be to this company five years from now, which is ironic given its name, of course, but I don't think that ultimately is really a problem. I mean, this is just turning into a beverage company at the end of the day.Depletions up 36%. Remember that sales from distributors to retailers. You know, it wasn't all that long ago where depletions, we were talking about negative numbers. So, they really turned this thing around. And part of that is due to that Dogfish Head acquisition; that's helpful. A lot of it, though, has to do with, like you mentioned, the seltzer and the other beverages that they're rolling out. And talking about other beverages, they're bringing some new ideas to the table in 2021, things like Truly Iced Tea Hard Seltzer; Samuel Adams' Just The Haze, which is going to be a nonalcoholic beer; Dogfish Head's scratch-made canned cocktails; and Angry Orchard hard fruit cider. So, as you can see there, not a whole lot of beer, but a lot of other stuff, and it's really helping this business grow.Now, I don't know that I'd put the stock at the top of my list given the valuation, it's still trading around 65X trailing earnings now, 72X full-year estimates, but it's a wonderful business. And for those who own the stock, I think it's a wonderful one to keep holding, probably not a buy at this price today, but a good business nonetheless.Hill: Is there any risks there of expanding their brand portfolio too quickly?Moser: Yeah, I think that definitely that risk definitely exists. I mean, you've always got to be aware of execution risk. And you've seen other larger players in the space, whether it's Diageo or Constellation, they get to a point where they get bloated and they start paring back that portfolio, selling off some brands, so there is something to be said for taking it slow in that regard.Hill: Speaking of getting rid of brands, mixed results for Coca-Cola's (NYSE: KO) third quarter. Profits were higher than expected, but overall revenue dropped 9%. Ron, I feel like with the metrics that Coca-Cola is putting up, they're seeing improvement, but they're not out of the woods yet.Gross: Perfectly stated. These are better than expected results, but they're still not great, the partial reopening of theaters and restaurants certainly has helped them, because that's a big part of their business. But net revenues are down 9%. Global unit case volume trends are improving as things start to open, but they are still down 4%, so still ways to go there. Elevated levels of sales in the at-home channel more than offset by the pressure in the away-from-home channels, as they call.Coke generates about half of its revenue from selling its soft drinks at public venues, so when things are closed, there's nothing they can do about it except absorb the pain. They saw some margin improvement. They did a nice job controlling costs, which is definitely what you want to see when times are tough. So, adjusted earnings down only 2%, I say only still down, but not terrible. Management thinks increasing COVID cases, Winter months could actually lead to a further slowing, so we're not out of the woods, and in fact the woods may be getting a little darker again at some point.Interestingly, as you said, they're going to cut a number of brands. They're going to cut their brands by half to about 200, so they're going to cut about 200, they'll be left with about 200. They're going to phase out some of your favorites, Jason, I know, Zico coconut water, and we talked about Tab last week. Diet Coke Feisty Cherry, how about that, I don't know, I'm not a fan of that, but I think that's smart; they got bloated, they have to rationalize their brands, definitely too many of them, focus on what's working and get rid of what's not.Hill: All right. Ron Gross, Jason Moser, guys, we'll see you later in the show.Nell Minow is the Vice Chair of ValueEdge Advisors, she's also the film critic known as The Movie Mom. She joins me now. Nell, thanks for being here.Nell Minow: Always a pleasure.Hill: I want to start with essentially the industry that is corporate governance, because during the pandemic, we've seen a lot of industries undergo a lot of change, some of it is good. Certainly, workplace collaboration businesses have been thriving during the pandemic. At the other end of the spectrum, the restaurant industry is really hurting. Has corporate governance improved during the pandemic, has it stayed the same, or has it gotten worse?Minow: It's continues to be bad, but it's bad in slightly different ways than it had been. You know, when we had the big market correction in March, I started getting a flood of emails saying, you know, should we reprice options, what are we going to do to protect our executives? And of course, my view is, we're not in business to protect them, we're in business for them to have their interests aligned with those of investors. And that has not necessarily been the case. So, some companies have been responsive, but not very effectively.Companies have tweeted, we talked about this before, they tweeted about how much they support Black Lives Matter, and people have tweeted back to them, could we see a picture of your Board of Directors? You know, what is actually behind that? While there are some business leaders that are calling for tying CEO pay to Paris Agreement climate goals or to diversity, I think you're going to hear a lot more discussion of that as we start to get, as I've said before, not back to normal, but back to better. So, you're going to see investors expecting a lot of changes.And in the world of government regulation, corporate governance has gotten much, much worse with the shoving out the door of two rules at the SEC and two at the Labor Department that have been on the wish list of the Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable for a long time, the shareholders are very unhappy about.Hill: Let's move to the movie industry, and specifically, the movie theaters. We've seen, over the past six months, the biggest theater chains in the world, AMC (NYSE: AMC), Cineworld, Cinemark, all of their stocks are down big for all of the obvious reasons. How big is the threat right now to the movie theater industry?Minow: It's a pretty existential threat. The best thing that I can say about the movie industry is that, while we certainly have enjoyed a [laughs] wonderful world of movies being streamed straight to us, most recently Pixar announced that their big new movie Soul is going to come straight to Disney+. The fact is that there is a very, very solid number of movie ticket buyers, primarily ages 15 to 30, who are going to continue to go to theaters, they're not going to be happy staying at home; it is a part of their social life. And so, I think that if the movie theaters can just hold on for a little bit longer, their ticket buyers will be back.Hill: What should people who enjoy movies expect in terms of the next couple of years? I'm curious about the production pipeline, because a bunch of big action movies that were going to get released this year have been pushed into 2021. A lot of other movies have shut down production. Should we just gear ourselves for a lot of animated movies for the next couple of years, because you can actually produce those remotely?Minow: ... But not quickly; [laughs] animated movies take a long time, so, no. What I can tell you is that my daughter is a costume designer in Hollywood. She is back in business. She looks like she's wearing a hazmat suit, because, you know, costume designers are very up close and personal with the stars, measuring them. And so, she's got a face shield and gloves. And that complicates her job very much. My future son-in-law is a screenwriter, his most recent film finished filming already and is coming to television. So, the industry is definitely continuing. You will not see the great, big action movies going into production for a little while and you won't see a lot of kissing scenes, but you will certainly continue to see movies.Hill: [laughs] Wow! Romance is going to really take a hit over the next couple of years on the big screen.Minow: Yeah. Did you hear that some of the soap operas are using mannequins? [laughs]Hill: That's not true; is that true?Minow: Yes, it is.Hill: Argh! Speaking of action movies. I mean, to the extent that there is a silver lining of those movies being pushed into 2021, it could be that, as we see this time of year, the movies that are gunning for Oscars maybe get a little bit more attention, because they don't have to compete with the latest James Bond movie or the latest Marvel movie, is that going to be the case, and if so, what are a couple of movies we should be on the lookout for over the next two to three months?Minow: You know, I'm a member of the Critics' Choice Association, and I'm not sure if it was the smartest idea in the world, but we announced this year we're creating a new category so that we can give an award, a special award to superhero movies, but we just won't have anything [laughs] to pick from this year. Well, I did mention Soul from Pixar, I think that's going to be very big. The movie that the inside buzz says is absolutely a lock for some nominations is Nomadland which has been at some festivals. And, of course, festivals are continuing, they're just virtual; I've been to several myself. So, Nomadland, directed by Chloe Zhao and starring Frances McDormand, who is currently the frontrunner for Best Actress.The Trial of the Chicago 7, which I think is a great movie, is on Netflix. People are talking about Michelle Pfeiffer as a nominee for French Exit. And Viola Davis for Ma Rainey's Black Bottom. You might see Chadwick Boseman get a sentimental, and I'm sure very well deserved, because he's always wonderful, a nomination for that one as well. George Clooney has got a movie coming out called The Midnight Sky, he's always interesting as a director. And then Regina King, Oscar winning actress, her first movie as a director, One Night in Miami, is coming out.So, personally, I would like to see the new David Copperfield get some awards, because I absolutely loved it, and I think they really blew it in the way that they released it, not putting it into streaming quickly enough.Hill: More immediately, we've got Halloween coming around the corner. Any scary movie recommendations? You know, I don't even know if I know this about you, are you a fan of the horror genre?Minow: [laughs] I'm not a fan of the horror genre. I'm such a sissy, I always think that Lassie is not going to get Timmy out of the well, but I do like some kinds of movies. I like psychological thrillers. And there's a small independent film that I always recommend, because I think it was very well -- if you like, sort of, Twilight Zone type scary, then I recommend it, it's called Coherence. My daughter, as I said, is a costume designer, and her most recent project is coming out next week. It is the remake/sequel to the legendary movie, The Craft, about the teenage girl witches. And that's got a female writer-director I like very much, so I'm looking forward to that.And then there are a couple of good ones for kids that are new, A Babysitter's Guide to Monster Hunting on Netflix and The Witches remake on HBO Max, those are a lot of fun for kids.Hill: Like you, I'm not a huge fan of the genre, although from a business standpoint, I think the horror movie industry is fascinating, in part because it is a profitable way to make movies, there are a lot of directors who get their first shot at making a movie by making a horror film, including, by the way, Steven Spielberg. So, it's one of those things that I find interesting from a business perspective, in part because these are -- look, every movie studio wants their movie to be a hit in whatever is the home country, but they want to be able to export it, and horror is one of those things that seems to travel pretty well.Minow: Horror travels very, very well, humor does not, because that's very culturally based and with a lot of -- it's very specific cultural references to make something funny. So, action and horror travel extremely well. You do not need to speak English or understand, you know, the U.S. constitution to understand horror. And so, the ROI [Return on Investment] on horror movies is excellent. They don't cost much to make and they do make a lot of money.Hill: One more reason to be on Twitter, so you can follow Nell Minow, get her thoughts on business, corporate governance, movies and a lot more.Guys, a couple of more news items before we get to radar stocks. Microsoft, McDonald's, Lennar, Starbucks, and Conagra, are just a few of the companies that have increased their dividends recently. Ron, six months ago, we saw dividends being cut, being suspended, I don't want to get overly optimistic, but should we see this reversal of this trend as a good thing?Gross: It's a good thing in selected areas. We're still seeing weakness in dividends, as you said, either suspensions or cuts in industries where that's appropriate. And then the airlines, for example, would be a good example, but there are companies that are doing quite well or they think they will be doing quite well this time next year, and they can, kind of, see that light at the end of the tunnel. So, even though business might be weak, like Starbucks isn't, you know, gangbusters right now, because not much is, they felt comfortable to raise the dividend. McDonald's feels comfortable, Microsoft feels comfortable. Some are 2% or 3%, some are 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, which is an even bigger indication that things are going well.I will point out that when things are tough, you kind of do want management to make those tough decisions and cut dividends and stop share buybacks, if it's necessary. You want to do what's necessary for the business, even though it's painful, especially if you're an investor who's looking for that income, but you do want management to make those really important capital allocation decisions. And then when things are better, we see the increases come back.Hill: Quibi, the short-video streaming service that launched in April is being shut down. Quibi was started two years ago by Jeffrey Katzenberg and Meg Whitman. They raised $1.75 billion. And amazingly Jason, the money's all gone.Moser: Chris, I mean, that was an amazing, amazing story from so many different angles. And it's ultimately a shame, I understand there are some people out of work for this. Yeah, I don't think it really comes as a surprise that this was something that didn't make it. I think it all really stemmed from the very beginning, I don't think anyone really knew what Quibi was supposed to be. It didn't have a firm identity really, it was either social, or it was streaming or social streaming, and it was really difficult to figure out what kind of void it was trying to fill. So, I think the lesson here, honestly is, when you're going to jump into a crowded space -- and let's be clear, video streaming is a [laughs] very, very crowded space -- it is imperative that you differentiate yourself, you innovate, you do something different. I mean, there is only so much room for imitators. And I think that this space is now so mature, anyone jumping in there and thinking that they're just going to do something similar to what everybody else is doing, it's going to be a very short-lived stretch for them in that space.Hill: I really think this is going to be one of those things that gets studied in business schools. Just the amount of money they raised, the speed with which they burned through all of it, it's going to be a cautionary tale for a long time. [laughs]Gross: I don't know if it's all gone, I think there might be $350 million left for them to play with, but you know, then you've got closing costs and liquidation costs and who knows what will happen. But I think investors will get a tiny bit of their money back, but it's a cautionary tale.Moser: I stand by Quibi as a verb. I mean, I think we can use that going forward as like, you know, when you really just mess something up, like, you make a bad decision or you just really mess something up, oh, man! You really Quibied that one. I think that in certain situations it works.Hill: Shares of fast food chain Jack in the Box (NASDAQ: JACK) up nearly 10% in the past month, and I think I know why, gents, enthusiasm for the latest promotional item from Jack in the Box, a fried chicken-scented facemask. This has been created to help promote a new plant-based chicken sandwich that the company is testing, not to be confused with the bacon-scented face mask that Hormel produced. Ron, I can't think of a Jack in the Box that's close by me, which is unfortunate, because I think I'd try this. [laughs]Gross: This is the Jack in the Box in Belgium by any case. [laughs] Because Belgium is doing some wacky things lately. This is, I don't know, decline of Western civilization, even a bacon one, like you said, that Hormel has, would be good for like a minute, but I think it would get pretty exhausting after that, it just seems a little silly to me.Hill: The one I'm hoping for, Cinnabon.Moser: Oh! See, I'm right there. The one I'd like to see, if Starbucks could come out with one that smells like a freshly opened bag of coffee beans, I would be onboard with that.Hill: Let's go to our man behind the glass, Dan Boyd. Dan, any of these masks of interest to you?Dan Boyd: No, Chris. The only way I can see this happening at Jack in the Box is somebody got a bunch of masks and then, like, left them in the restaurant overnight or something, came back and put one on, it was like, oh! This mask smells like chicken. Wait, this is great, [laughs] this is a great idea, let me tell the boss. No, this is ridiculous. I'm sorry, I can't get behind this at all.Gross: It's actually not the mask that smells, there's a little insert, I believe, that has the scent. So, if you want to remove the insert, you get yourself a Jack in the Box mask free of chicken.Moser: But did you read at the bottom of that little review, there's the slight tinge of an alcohol smell to go with the chicken. I mean, it just sounds like a headache waiting to happen.Gross: Oh, it's horrible.Hill: Let's get to the stocks on our radar. Dan is going to hit you with a question. Jason, you're up first, what are you looking at?Moser: Yeah, a company I've mentioned here before on the show. Ameris Bancorp (NASDAQ: ABCB), ticker ABCB. Earnings just came out. The company reported a very strong quarter. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.69, that was versus $0.98 a year ago. So, very healthy growth in the mortgage side of the business; no surprise there. Efficiency ratio below 50% now, just over 47%. Net interest margin pressure continues, but every bank is pretty much in the same boat where that's concerned. And they continue to maintain as healthy a number there as they can.Total assets are now about $20 billion, deposits up now to $16 billion. They've really improved the deposit mix, non-interest bearing deposits now represent almost 37% of total deposits. That is up from 29%, 30% a year ago, which is just tremendous. I mean, that really is a good source of profitability for these banks, especially in difficult times, because they don't have to shell out as much for those deposits that they maintain.So, the big question really remains on the acquisition front. They've talked about some pent-up activity they see coming in M&A here as the pandemic, you know, cycles through, so that'll be something to keep an eye on as far as the banking sector writ large, but another strong quarter from a bank that I enjoy following and still own shares in, personally.Hill: Dan, question about Ameris Bancorp?Boyd: Absolutely, Chris. Jason, with mortgages on the rise and housing supply, kind of, staying the same, are we going to run out of houses for banks like this to continue financing in the near future?Moser: Well, we're not going to run out of houses, because thankfully, we have lots of homebuilders that'll help that. But you are right, the supply is getting a little bit crimped, we're seeing a lot of valuations go up because the demand is there, so it's a nice time to be a homeowner and a tricky time if you're in the market to buy a new house.Hill: Ron Gross, what are you looking at?Gross: Some interesting developments this week with CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ: CRSP), CRSP, that sent the stock down rather sharply. One of the three or four early stage biotech companies focused on the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology. The good news is that a treatment for a drug under development led to the complete remission for two out of the four patients who received it; this is for a cancer trial. The bad and very sad news is that one patient who received the highest dosage did die, and died from complications that are sometimes seen from cancer therapies. So, more investigation clearly needs to be done there. I don't think this throws off the thesis or puts the company in a bad light, I think things remain on track. But again, it's a very early stage company with some significant technology and very volatile, so buyer beware.Hill: Dan?Boyd: Ron, CRISPR gene editing, let's go, man! What genes are you editing first for yourself?Gross: I would love some blue eyes if I could get those. [laughs]Hill: What do you want to add to your watchlist, Dan?Boyd: You know, Chris, I'm always up on medical technology, I think it's only going to get more and more important as time goes on. So, I'm with Ron this time around for CRISPR Therapeutics.Hill: All right. Ron Gross, Jason Moser, guys, thanks for being here.Gross: Thanks, Chris.Moser: Thank you.Hill: That's going to do it for this week's Motley Fool Money.

85,"Oct 27, 2020 9:01AM EDT","For a day that marked Tesla's (TSLA) fifth straight quarter of reporting positive profits, last week's 0.7% increase in the share price of Tesla stock seemed somewhat underwhelming.Reporting earnings Wednesday night, Tesla closed trading Thursday up only modestly, and really, only barely outperforming the S&P 500's overall 0.5% move. Tesla called Q3 its ""best quarter in history,"" with pro forma earnings coming in 36% ahead of expectations at $0.76 per share, sales of $8.8 billion about 6% better than predicted, and free cash flowing strongly -- $1.9 billion over the past 12 months.Tesla told investors Wednesday that it remains on target to produce and deliver half a million electric cars this year, despite the fact that ""this goal has become more difficult"" to achieve in the face of Covid-19. Cybertruck deliveries are expected to begin late next year. Even Tesla's ""energy"" business -- solar roofs and solar storage -- looks ""poised for strong growth,"" said the company.Much of Wall Street applauded the news, with R.W. Baird and JMP Securities both upgrading Tesla shares to ""outperform"" and Piper Sandler calling Tesla a ""must-own"" stock, and as both Oppenheimer and RBC Capital raised price targets on the shares. One analyst, however, stood out from the crowd for his continued pessimism on Tesla:Gordon Johnson of GLJ Research says Tesla is still a ""sell.""Urging investors not to forget the forest for the trees, Johnson reminds Elon Musk fans that Tesla continues to rely heavily upon taxpayer-funded subsidies in the form of tax credits for the production of zero-emission vehicles (ZEV). With automotive giants such as Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Volkswagen all ramping up their own sales of electric cars, though, soon they will not need to buy ZEV credits from Tesla to hit their fuel efficiency targets set by California and other ""green"" states. And this could become a problem for Tesla, says Johnson, because the sale of ZEV credits continues to make up literally all of money that has kept Tesla's profits positive these past five quarters.Ultimately, the 100%-profit revenues generated from the sale of ZEV credits will disappear, warns Johnson, noting that ""TSLA, itself, describes credit sales as non-recurring in nature."" Although the analyst admits that Tesla's gross margins have grown nicely, hitting 25% in the third quarter even discounting the effect of ZEV credit sales, trouble emerges a bit closer to the bottom line. Johnson notes that the company remains GAAP unprofitable but for the effect of ZEV credits.  Back them out, and Tesla would have lost $97 million in Q3. Indeed, back them out and... ""TSLA hasn’t been profitable ...since 3Q19.""Of course, Tesla is famously viewed by investors as a growth stock. So isn't it possible Tesla can just grow its way out of this problem? Sell more cars, and become so profitable that it no longer needs ZEVs?Maybe. But Johnson isn't optimistic.From Q2 2020 to Q3 2020, Tesla has grown its ability to produce cars to a stated capacity of 840,000 vehicles per year. Despite the added capacity, however, Tesla is only predicting that it might sell 500,000 cars this year. This seems to speak to a lack of demand for the product even at present production levels, and in Johnson's view, this lack of demand explains why Tesla has cut its prices ""now 13 times in 2020 alone.""Conclusion: Johnson disagrees with those who call Tesla ""fairly valued"" or even ""undervalued"" at its current P/E of more than 1,000 times trailing earnings. The analyst rates Tesla stock a sell, and continues to predict a 90% share price decline. (To watch Johnson's track record, click here)Overall, Wall Street is not as bearish on TSLA as Johnson, but is not convinced on this stock, either. TSLA holds a Moderate Buy from the analyst consensus, based on 9 ""buy"" ratings – but also 9 ""holds"" and 9 ""sells."" Shares sell for $420.28, and the $378.39 average price target suggests a 10% downside from current levels.

86,"Oct 27, 2020 7:36AM EDT","Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) new factory in Shanghai, China has been a blockbuster success for the company. Going from breaking ground at the beginning of 2019 to vehicle production less than a year later, the new factory has already become a critical component to Tesla's growth story. In fact, the factory is now producing so many cars that it is beginning to export vehicles to Europe instead of just making vehicles for the local market.Here's a closer look at the factory's production capacity -- and how it has become imperative to the automaker's continued growth.Elon Musk at the groundbreaking event for Tesla's Gigafactory 3 in China. Image source: Tesla.When Tesla first announced its factory in China, the company said the factory would be built to ship vehicles within the China market. This has been true up until now.A Chinese news website called The Paper reported Monday morning that Tesla is shipping about 7,000 Model 3 vehicles from the Chinese factory to Europe this week, highlighting how important the factory has become to Tesla's continued growth.Investors first learned of Tesla's plans to start shipping vehicles from its Shanghai factory to other markets in September, when Bloomberg reported that the factory may have the capacity to ship vehicles to other Asian countries and to Europe. According to Tesla's third-quarter update, the Shanghai factory now has the installed production capacity to build 250,000 Model 3 units annually. This is up from a capacity of 200,000 in the prior quarter. Tesla factory in California. Image source: The Motley Fool.But Tesla's Shanghai factory may soon see another huge jump in vehicle production capacity, as the automaker is currently building out its Model Y production capacity at the factory.During Tesla's third-quarter earnings call last week, management was unsurprisingly pleased with Tesla's progress in China.""Then in terms of capacity build out, we're making progress on three major factories,"" said CEO Elon Musk in the company's third-quarter shareholder letter.Musk continued:We're continuing to expand Shanghai significantly, which is going incredibly well. The Tesla China team is just, I mean, incredibly good. ... It's like I'm always amazed by how much progress the Tesla China team makes. It's beyond all reasonable expectations.Shanghai isn't the only place Tesla is making big progress on production capacity. During Q3, Tesla's annual production capacity at its factory in Fremont, California increased by 100,000 vehicles.

87,"Oct 27, 2020 6:31AM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf you’re going to invest in Electrameccanica Vehicles (NASDAQ:SOLO) stock for the long term, you have to be willing to stay the course and celebrate the small victories. That’s my message to investors in a time when the share price seems to be stuck in neutral.The last thing you want to do is get jealous of Nio (NYSE:NIO) investors. It’s tempting to compare the two stocks. Both of them traded at $2 and change earlier this year. Today, NIO stock is above $25 while SOLO is still $2 and change.Constantly comparing your investments to other people’s investments isn’t a constructive thing to do. It could cause you to abandon a perfectly good trade. Worse yet, you might end up chasing the price of an already expensive stock.My contention is that Electrameccanica Vehicles still holds great promise in the electric vehicle domain. The company is making progress, even if it’s relatively low-key. Hopefully, this progress will eventually be reflected in the SOLO share price.During the summer of 2020, electric vehicle stocks all seemed to ascend in tandem. For the most part, I believe that this was due to the breathtaking climb in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock.Still, even though the “Tesla effect” might have been the catalyst, the rise in the SOLO stock price was nonetheless dramatic. The sentiment was euphoric as traders bid SOLO up from less than $2 to the 52-week high of $6 within a couple of weeks.Chasing parabolic moves is rarely a good strategy (in my humble opinion). Thus, SOLO stock soon dropped into a range between $2 and $3. The stock has stayed there for quite a while now.The bulls did make a valiant attempt to break SOLO stock above $3 in mid-October. However, that attempt failed and the stock is back in the range again. Will SOLO ever escape and have its liftoff moment?Fans of Electrameccanica Vehicles’ SOLO model cars tend to like the way they look. These are truly unusual three-wheeled vehicles that have to be seen to be appreciated.Yet, the electric vehicle market isn’t just about looks. It’s also about promoting clean energy, and lately the trend has been toward more functional vehicles.Fortunately, Electrameccanica Vehicles is well aware of this trend and is taking action. In 2021, the company expects to roll out utility and fleet versions of its SOLO vehicles.We’re not talking about huge 18-wheel cross-country trucks here. Remember, SOLO vehicles aren’t meant to be huge. Rather, they’ll be right-sized for “purpose-built for utility and fleet applications, including food delivery, small parcel and post distribution, technician transportation for service calls and security.”I’m personally looking forward to the rollout of the SOLO utility and fleet vehicles. Electrameccanica is known for producing highly efficient vehicles, so their new SOLO versions could be a big hit with businesses seeking to reduce transportation costs.Again, the overarching theme here is patience. Unlike Tesla, Electrameccanica Vehicles isn’t about flash and grandeur. Investors shouldn’t expect Electrameccanica to grab headlines, nor should they expect SOLO stock to shoot to the moon this year.Instead, investors should acknowledge progress when they see it. For instance, Electrameccanica recently narrowed down its prospective locations for the company’s planned U.S.-based assembly facility and engineering technical center.The two finalist locations are the Phoenix, Arizona metro area and the Nashville, Tennessee region.Besides creating hundreds of new jobs, the new facility will “feature a state-of-the art engineering technical center, including plans for multiple labs to support ongoing vehicle, chassis and power electronics testing as well as comprehensive research facilities.”To me, this is what a hyper-growth company looks like. By expanding into a new region and building a new facility, Electrameccanica Vehicles is demonstrating that the company expects to generate profits and thereby deliver value for shareholders.Will SOLO stock break out of its range this or next week? That’s not the key issue to worry about.Instead, stay the course and hold your shares as the long-term view on Electrameccanica Vehicles suggests incremental but steady progress and, eventually, a breakout moment.On the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.The post Electrameccanica Vehicles Stock Won’t Stay Stuck Forever appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/electrameccanica-vehicles-stock-wont-stay-stuck-forever-2020-10-27

90,"Oct 27, 2020 5:01AM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRecently amped up Workhorse Group (NASDAQ:WKHS) is seeing investors continue to pull the plug. But does that offer an opportunity for today’s buyers? Let’s look at what’s going on in the market, as well as off and on the price chart of WKHS stock to reach a stronger risk-adjusted determination.Some WKHS investors must be asking themselves, what just happened? After defying a broad-based September correction with brutish relative and absolute strength to reach momentum-driven all-time-highs and gains approaching 1,000% in 2020, October volatility has turned outright seasonally bearish for “last mile” commercial EV and drone delivery upstart Workhorse.And with a new trading week underway, conditions aren’t getting any better for Workhorse shareholders.Out-the-gate Monday WKHS stock was off about 7.50%. The pressure compares unfavorably to a mostly flat tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index and 800 lbs. EV gorilla Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) which are largely shaking off broader market pressure in the likes of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 index linked to continued investor concern over rising Covid-19 cases, pre-election jitters and a stalled congressional stimulus package.To be fair, EV plays Nio (NYSE:NIO), Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) and XPeng (NYSE:XPEV) are also showing losses on the session. But WKHS remains the weakest in the space. So, what gives? Why has Workhorse continued to decorrelate, first while the broader averages corrected in September and now during the market’s improved situation and rally over the past month?Some of the weakness in WKHS can be attributed to a still-pending announcement by the U.S. Postal Service regarding its $6.3 billion next generation delivery vehicle contract. The deal is now expected to happen before the end of the year. And importantly, it can’t be stressed enough that time is money, a lot of money, as it relates to this significant award.Bottom-line, a deal with the USPS, even a piece of the contract, would prove a big win for WKHS. The thing is shares are still up more than 515% year-to-date. At the same time, and as InvestorPlace’s Chris Lau noted, last quarter’s sales amounted to a measly $92,000 while WKHS stock fetches nearly $2 billion in market capitalization. So yeah, it’s understandable some investors could be growing antsy. Obviously, there’s a lot at stake.Then there’s Fuzzy Panda Research. Without getting into the well-publicized nitty gritty, earlier this month the short-seller issued a damning attack on the company which stated that Workhorse misled investors on multiple fronts which could knock it out of contention with the USPS. And some investors did in fact, do more than simply listen to the report as shares sold off in the report’s immediate aftermath.
Click to EnlargeSource: Charts by TradingViewThe last force at work in WKHS is that all stocks correct. And as some investors have learned, that goes for champs and the most dominant of companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). It’s also true that volatile, smaller capitalization up-and-comers with modest stock floats which lack of institutional support are even more prone to falling victim to periods of non-correlated bearish price behavior. And the fact is Workhorse shares check all those boxes.The good news is Workhorse is entering value territory on the price chart. With shares of WKHS having now corrected 40% from their Sept. 21 all-time-high, the stock has already overshot a more common cyclical decline of around 30%. Optimistically, the bearish decline could go from a situation of near-term pain and into an opportunity for longer-term gain for shareholders. That said, though and technically speaking, today’s discomfort for shareholders isn’t yet showing signs of finishing on the weekly chart.The lost ground since October’s peak in share price is taking on the shape of a “W” or double-bottom corrective pattern. It’s bullish. Having formed one pivot low following September’s all-time-high and then a mid-pivot high earlier this month, shares of WKHS should be monitored for a second lower-low pivot to develop to make the case for an intermediate-term bottom. That’s the first step.A second critical step in our observation is for investors to wait for a currently misaligned stochastics indicator to favorably cross back over into a more supportive position. This appears all the more important given Workhorse has failed the 38% Fibonacci level tied to its year-to-date cycle and band support could allow WKHS to continue driving towards $13 a share before and if, all is said and done.On the date of publication, Chris Tyler held, directly or indirectly, positions in Nio (NIO) and its derivatives, but no other securities mentioned in this article.The information offered is based upon Christopher Tyler’s observations and strictly intended for educational purposes only; the use of which is the responsibility of the individual.

91,"Oct 26, 2020 4:39PM EDT","In a recent interview on Motley Fool Live, Motley Fool co-founder and CEO Tom Gardner recalled meeting Kendal Musk -- the brother of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. As Tom recalls, ""He looked at me and he said, 'I don't know, I just learned. Don't bet against my brother.'""Tesla short-sellers are learning that the hard way (again) after Tesla shattered analysts' expectations for the company's third quarter results, which were released on Oct. 21 after market close. Here's what investors need to know. Image source: Tesla.*Adjusted Earnings Per Share, diluted (a non-GAAP measure). Data source: Tesla. Chart by author.Those are impressive numbers, made even more impressive by the fact that they're being posted in the midst of a U.S. recession during which there are fewer drivers on the roads. When 39% revenue growth is the lowest percentage gain in your marquee figures, you know it's at least a good report. For Tesla, the third quarter wasn't just good: it was record-setting. Quarterly revenue set a new record high for the company, at $8.8 billion, which was expected due to the company's strong delivery numbers. Another record is the $331 million in quarterly net income, which surpassed Tesla's previous milestone of $311 million, set in third quarter 2018. For me, the most jaw-dropping figure is Tesla's $2.4 billion in operating cash flow for the quarter, which is nearly double its previous quarterly record, set in fourth quarter 2017. Despite the company's outperformance -- EPS topped analysts' consensus estimates by $0.20/share -- shares closed up less than 1% from the previous day's close. This could indicate that the expectation of big growth is already priced into the lofty valuation of Tesla's stock. CEO Elon Musk, never one to understate his successes, started the earnings call by telling it the way he saw it: ""All right. So, Q3 was our best quarter in history.""He highlighted the company's other initiatives, including the incremental advances in battery technology that Tesla showcased at its Battery Day, the beta release of Full Self-Driving mode, the continued buildout of the company's manufacturing capabilities, and a projected increase in sales of Solar Roof, which he referred to as a ""killer product.""He also doubled down on the company's stated goal of continuing to cut prices:If the car is too expensive... and people don't have enough money in their bank account, they simply can't buy it no matter what the value proposition is. So it is important to lower the prices. ... I do not think we lack for desire for our product, but we do lack for affordability. Some analysts are concerned that, as the company grows sales of its lower-priced cars and pursues price cuts, it won't be able to maintain its double-digit margin target. CFO Zachary Kirkhorn agreed with Musk on the need for affordability, but didn't think it was mutually exclusive with margin growth:If you just look at the journey of the company over the last 1.5 years, we have grown volumes and grown gross margins despite a number of price reductions over that period of time, and we have kept OpEx fairly stable during that period of time as well. We have to also continue to make progress improving the cost structure ... and improve the value of the vehicles at the same time. So in addition to reducing the cost of the car, we're making the cars better. And that's the formula to sell the volume. That's what we're focused on.One way to do this, according to Musk, is to bring as much manufacturing in-house as possible. ""There's in excess of a dozen start-ups effectively in Tesla,"" Musk said, citing microchips, battery cells, superchargers, and autonomous driving as areas that other car companies outsource but Tesla doesn't. ""Tesla is absolutely vertically integrated compared to other auto companies or basically most any company,"" said Musk. ""We literally make the machine.""""Quite frankly, we would like to outsource less,"" concluded Musk. ""That would be great.""The third quarter's strong performance indicates that Tesla has finally turned the corner when it comes to profitability and cash flow generation from its passenger cars.Interestingly, Musk and his management team didn't even mention the Semi or Cybertruck until they were specifically asked about them by the analysts on the call. They only briefly mentioned the company's often-overlooked energy storage products, Powerwall and Megacell. The primary focus of the earnings call -- and the company -- is clearly on its passenger cars. That's probably good news for investors, since Tesla's cars are in demand and selling well. Focusing on maximizing their profitability and improving their affordability is probably going to give Tesla the biggest bang for its buck in terms of improving the (already-much-improved) bottom line. Tesla's sky-high valuation should give new investors pause, but operationally, it seems to be on solid footing, and its impressive growth streak seems likely to continue. I wouldn't place any bets against the company right now.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

92,"Oct 26, 2020 4:29PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsElectric delivery van maker Workhorse (NASDAQ:WKHS) was a relatively unknown company for years. Until 2020. Until it became crystal clear that electric vehicles are the future of auto transportation, and Workhorse stock became investors’ favorite way to play the electrification wave in the delivery van vertical.At one point in September, WKHS was up a jaw-dropping 920% year-to-date.Of course, the meteoric rally in WKHS stock has attracted the attention of multiple bears, pundits and critics. Many notable short-sellers out there — like Hindenburg Research and Fuzzy Panda Research — see Workhorse as a wildly overhyped EV company, built on all hype and no substance, with a hyperextended valuation. Naturally, if you were to listen to those guys, you’d easily walk away thinking WKHS stock is a screaming sell after its huge 2020 rally.But the weight of evidence and data today suggests that the bear thesis will ultimately prove wrong here.Indeed, most logical signs point to the fact that WKHS stock could soar 200% over the next few years.Here’s why.WKHS stock has turned into one of the market’s favorite stocks in 2020 for a few reasons.One, it’s become crystal clear that electric is the future of transportation. Consumers want more electric cars. Businesses are committing to and doubling down on sustainability targets. Countries are implementing and sticking to legislature to decarbonize transportation. And, perhaps most importantly, the technology and economics underlying electric vehicles has improved to a point where they are a viable and economically sensible alternative to gas-powered autos.Two, the electric disruption of the delivery van market represents an exceptionally compelling investment opportunity. Over 350,000 last-mile delivery vans are purchased every year by U.S. fleet operators, at an average price of $50,000, for a total addressable market in the U.S. alone of nearly $18 billion. Less than 1% of fleet vehicles are electric today. Thus, over the next decade, the number of electric delivery vans in the world will grow by leaps and bounds, creating an multi-billion-dollar U.S. electric delivery van industry.Three, Workhorse has emerged as a clear leader in the electric delivery van space. In short, the company already has a working electric delivery van, with market leading range and top-notch performance specs, that the company is actively delivering to some of the biggest customers in this space — like FedEx (NYSE:FDX), UPS (NYSE:UPS), Ryder (NYSE:R) and DHL — at the same time that most other companies in the market are still in the “concept” phase.Connecting the dots, then, it’s actually pretty easy to see why WKHS stock rose by 10X in 2020. It has, to-date, been perceived as the best play on the electric delivery van megatrend.Over the past few months, some red flags have started to emerge with respect to the ostensibly compelling Workhorse growth narrative, and those red flags have, in sum, resulted in material weakness in WKHS stock.Specifically, much of the hype surrounding Workhorse stock in 2020 has centered around the company winning a 165,000 unit, $8.1 billion contract with the Untied States Postal Service (or USPS). That contract — dubbed Next Generation Delivery Vehicles, or NGDV for short — is widely considered the biggest and most valuable contract in the electric delivery market.Broadly, whoever wins that contract will likely turn into the runaway leader in the burgeoning electric delivery space.For months, Workhorse has been perceived by the market as the NGDV contract’s most likely winner, given Workhorse’s clear leadership in the electric delivery van market. But, multiple short-sellers like Hindenburg and Fuzzy Panda have recently cast doubt over Workhorse’s chances to win that contract, citing unnamed inside sources claiming that Workhorse’s trucks have not performed “up to par” during test trials with USPS.Those doubts received some credibility when, in October, USPS decided to delay its NGDV contract decision from October to December. USPS blamed the delay on “the current Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on Postal Service and supplier operations”. But, of course, it seems entirely likely that Workhorse blunders contributed to this delay.As doubts surrounding the USPS contract have grown in recent months, WKHS stock has plunged. And reasonably so. With the USPS contract, Workhorse gains immense visibility to turn into the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) of delivery vans. Without the USPS contract, Workhorse loses a lot of that visibility and potentially cedes market leadership to a competitor.In the former situation, WKHS stock soars over the next few years as electric delivery vans become the industry norm. In the latter situation, WKHS stock pitter patters until the next big catalyst.So … the big question with respect to WKHS stock is: Will Workhorse win the USPS contract?The weight of evidence and data today continues to suggest that — despite the delay — Workhorse will still win the USPS contract.According to numerous reports, there are three finalists for the USPS contract: Workhorse, specialty truck maker Oshkosh (backed by Ford (NYSE:F)), and a Turkish automotive company by the name of Karsan Automotive.It doesn’t make sense that USPS would want to outsource the contract all the way to Turkey, especially in this unstable geopolitical climate and amid a global pandemic, so a Karsan Automotive win seems unlikely.Meanwhile, Ford/Oshkosh provides formidable competition. But according to a 2018 press release, the Oshkosh/Ford entry in the NGDV program will have an internal combustion engine, i.e. it won’t be fully electric or zero-emission.Who does that leave?Workhorse. U.S. based. Fully electric. Completely zero-emission. Long track record of big contract wins with every other delivery and logistics company out there.Of the remaining competitors, Workhorse is the best fit for the USPS contract. That doesn’t mean the company is a lock to win the contract. But it does Workhorse is still the most likely winner.If the company does win the USPS contract in December, then WKHS stock will have clear visibility to enormous gains over the next few years.The the winner of the USPS contract will firmly establish themselves as the unrivaled leader in the electric delivery van market — and will presumably be able to leverage that leadership position to win more contracts with other delivery companies over the next few years, and ultimately turn into the industry’s Tesla.Depending on who you ask, Tesla controls anywhere between 60% and 80% of the U.S. EV market.Workhorse — if the company wins the USPS contract — has visibility to achieving that market share within the next few years in the U.S. electric delivery van market.Let’s say the 350,000-unit U.S. delivery market reaches 20% EV penetration by 2025. A ~70% share of that EV pie implies almost 50,000 Workhorse van deliveries in 2025. At a $50,000 price point, that implies about $2.5 billion in revenues — which is, as it turns out, just a smidge above Wall Street’s consensus 2025 revenue estimate.Based on a 15% operating margin and ~120 million shares outstanding, my modeling suggests $2.5 billion in 2025 revenues could easily flow into $3 in earnings per share.A basic 20X forward earnings multiple on that implies a 2024 price target for WKHS stock of $60 — nearly triple the WKHS stock price today.WKHS stock is risky. There’s no doubt about it. The company has a lot riding on the USPS contract. A win could send WKHS stock to the moon. A loss could send shares cratering.Still, the odds are good that Workhorse wins the USPS contract, and leverages that contract to turn into the Tesla of delivery vans in the U.S. over the next few years. If that does happen, WKHS stock has compelling upside potential from current levels.On the date of publication, Luke Lango did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The New Daily 10X Stock Report: 98.7% Accuracy – Gains Up to 466.78%. InvestorPlace’s brand-new and highly controversial newsletter… is rocking the industry… delivering one breakthrough stock recommendation each and every trading day… delivered straight to your inbox. 98.7% Accuracy to Date – Gains Up to 466.78%.

93,"Oct 26, 2020 4:15PM EDT","Shares of 3D printing company 3D Systems (NYSE: DDD) fell as much as 17.1% in trading Monday after a negative note came out from an analyst. Shares slid throughout the day and closed down 16.8% for the day. The culprit of the move was William Blair analyst Brian Drab, who questioned the rally 3D Systems' shares have experienced over the past month. Shares were up 46% in a month going into today, and it appears that a Tesla job posting related to 3D printing and a strong earnings report from Align Technologies had growth stock investors piling into the stock. Image source: Getty Images.Whether Tesla or Align Technologies uses 3D Systems' printers or services, this is business as usual and nothing to get too excited about. It isn't as if Tesla is building 3D printed cars and Align is a longtime customer. Sometimes a good story can lead to a lot of hype in a stock, and that appears to be what happened with 3D Systems over the past month. But the reality is that the company's revenue is dropping, and it's losing money year after year. Until the company can turn around its operations, I don't see a reason to buy a dip in the stock. 3D printing may have a bright future, but the industry has proven over and over again that the benefits aren't going to the 3D printer manufacturers themselves. 10 stocks we like better than 3D SystemsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

An adverse ruling by the ITC could lead to the import ban of SK Innovation's batteries and necessary components, potentially causing setbacks for Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE and Ford Motor F.N as they move to build new electric vehicles. The automakers     have said the dispute between the South Korean battery makers could disrupt supplies of the key EV parts and cost U.S. jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic. SK Innovation is building two EV battery factories in Georgia to manufacture batteries for Volkswagen's and Ford's electric vehicles.  LG Chem has set up an EV battery cell venture plant with GM in Ohio. The ITC did not elaborate further on its planned ruling.

95,"Oct 26, 2020 1:58PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith EV special purpose acquisition company stocks selling off since September, it’s no shock Spartan Energy (NYSE:SPAQ) stock has headed lower. SPAQ stock soared last summer on news of the acquisition of EV startup Fisker. But, Fisker has a long way to go before it’s the next Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).In the meantime, the company is a work in progress, as it brings its flagship Ocean SUV to market. Not only that, it has its work cut out for it building up the Fisker brand. As InvestorPlace’s Josh Enomoto wrote Oct. 22, the name has appeal with automotive enthusiasts. Yet, it’s far from being top of mind among the general public.With these challenges, it makes sense why investors are no longer madly in love with Spartan stock. Shares have fallen from a high of $21.60 per share, to around $10 per share.Could shares dip down into the single digits? With EV SPACs trending lower, it seems likely. However, for those who haven’t jumped in yet, that’s good news. At much lower price levels, potential returns may be well worth the high risk.As first-movers and legacy automakers enter the space, will there be room for EV names not yet ready for prime time? That’s the key question for development-stage electric automakers like Fisker. Sure, with its partnership with auto parts giant Magna (NYSE:MGA), it has secured the infrastructure needed to deliver its first run of Ocean SUVs on schedule (fourth quarter of 2022).Given that Magna’s contract manufacturing platform gives Fisker the scale to sell its first vehicles at a reasonable sticker price (around $40,000), the company has a shot at both competing on price, and being economically viable.On the other hand, the competition could accelerate between now and when it makes its first vehicle deliveries. Besides competing with Tesla’s Model Y SUV, legacy automaker Ford (NYSE:F), with its Mustang Mach-E, is throwing its hat in the ring. General Motors (NYSE:GM) is launching an EUV, or electric utility vehicle, version of its Chevrolet Bolt model, as well.With much lower name recognition, the upstart may have even greater pressure to sell on price. Sure, the Ocean has a lower MSRP than “Detroit Three” (legacy automaker) models like the Mach-E (starting price $42,895). But, given Ford has already slashed prices, it seems inevitable it would cut them again as new entrants enter the market.Fisker estimates it can generate annual sales of $10.6 billion by 2024. Not only that, but an estimated $2 billion in pre-tax profit that year as well. Yet, with the heavy competition from deeper-pocketed rivals, there’s no guarantee it’ll come close to hitting these numbers.Are EV stocks topping out, or just taking a breather? Again, like the odds of Fisker’s potential success, it’s tough to handicap. Tesla shares have tread water since late summer. But, names like Nio (NYSE:NIO) have continued to soar. Granted, given Nio’s a pure play on Chinese EV growth, much of its latest rally is due that market’s rapid EV industry recovery post-novel coronavirus. Yet, things have been much worse for the “also ran” EV SPAC stocks.SPAQ stock has tumbled significantly in recent weeks. Other EV SPAC plays, like Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA), are down massively during the same period.Nevertheless, after these heavy near-term losses, could we see a rebound in hard-hit EV SPAC stocks? It’s possible. As I discussed in a recent article about Workhorse (NASDAQ:WKHS), the results o the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election could help fuel another rally across-the-board for the space.Yet, even an electoral result in this sector’s favor may not be enough to boost SPAQ stock. Potential changes to EV policy in Washington may benefit the legacy automakers and Tesla more than upstarts like Fisker. Simply put, don’t rush out and buy this ahead of voters heading to the polls.In short, it’s tough to make a call on where “also-ran” EV stocks are headed in the near-term. With this uncertainty, it may be best to wait things out for now.At today’s prices, this EV SPAC is trading near its IPO price of $10 per share. But, with investors either cashing out, or getting doubtful over the prospects of its pending Fisker acquisition, there’s a chance shares continue to dip, and fall into the single-digits.While that’s bad news for those who bought near its highs, another move lower could mean a great opportunity to dive into SPAQ stock. At a much lower entry point, this speculative EV play’s potential long-term gains may be worth the risk.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not (either directly or indirectly) hold any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Thomas Niel, contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single stock analysis since 2016.The post Wait Until Spartan Energy Tumbles to Single-Digits appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/wait-until-spartan-energy-tumbles-to-single-digits-2020-10-26

96,"Oct 26, 2020 1:43PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDespite record-breaking third quarter earnings from the electric vehicle and clean energy giant, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock has traded lower over the past week.This sell-off doesn’t make much sense.Tesla’s earnings were amazing. The demand drivers underlying the company’s growth narrative are more powerful than they’ve ever been. The growth roadmap for this company over the next few years is as promising as it’s ever been. And, considering that Tesla is the leading disruptor of the very enormous auto and energy markets, TSLA stock still isn’t overvalued today.So don’t stress the recent sell-off in TSLA stock. Instead, take advantage of it.Long-term, Tesla stock is only going way higher.Here’s why.Tesla’s third quarter earnings report broadly underscored that the entire Tesla growth narrative is firing on all cylinders today, despite the fact that we are in the midst of a global pandemic.The numbers speak for themselves here.Tesla car deliveries soared 44% year-over-year to a record-high, because EV demand globally is surging and Tesla continues to make and sell the best EVs in the market. Volume of solar energy deployed rose 33% year-over-year, also to a record-high level, because clean energy demand is surging globally. Energy storage solution volume rose 59% year-over-year, also to a record-high, because a surge in clean energy needs to be accompanied by an equally big surge in storage solutions for that clean energy.Automotive revenues rose 39% year-over-year. Total revenues rose 39%. Automotive gross margins expanded 483 basis points. Total gross margins expanded 462 basis points. Operating profits rose 210%. Free cash flow rose 276%.Everything surged.And everything will keep surging, because the long-term growth roadmap for Tesla has never looked so promising.Looking out over the next few years, Tesla’s growth roadmap looks nothing short of spectacular.In 2021, Tesla’s Shanghai factory will hit full production capability, and Tesla will proceed to sell a lot of cars in the booming Chinese EV market. Concurrently, the company will continue to ramp production of the Model Y, and the company should sell a lot of those cars in North America in 2021. On the energy side, a “Blue Wave” in Washington — which looks increasingly likely — could position the U.S. for a huge solar and energy storage boom next year.Moving onto 2022, you have the Cybertruck and Semitruck launches in late 2021, and Berlin factory production ramp. Thus, by 2022, the Cybertruck will be widely available, the Semitruck will start deliveries, and the Berlin factory will be fully operational. Those three huge catalysts will help Tesla tap into the enormous global trucking market, and accelerate growth in the currently underpenetrated European EV market.Then, in 2023, Tesla is promising us a $25,000 electric car. I don’t really need to explain why a Tesla EV at a $25,000 price point would be a game-changer for the world. It also looks like Tesla’s self-driving tech will be more fully fleshed out by 2023, and if so, hype surrounding this new tech will drum up even more demand, especially if Tesla sells that tech in its $25,000 car (thereby delivering self-driving to the masses).Overall, then, the Tesla growth narrative should accelerate meaningfully over the next few years. Revenues will ramp. Margins will improve. Profits will soar. And the TSLA stock price will keep moving higher.As I’ve said before, between its auto and energy businesses, Tesla is a trillion dollar company in the making.The math here is simple.By 2035, I see revenues measuring somewhere around $400 billion, with $180 billion coming from auto (on the assumption that Tesla continues to dominate a global EV market that increasingly disrupts the legacy auto market), $187.5 billion coming from energy (on the assumption that Tesla leverages its leading solar and battery storage technology to become the world’s largest solar panel and battery storage provider), and the rest coming from related services.Gross margins should hover above 25%, while the opex rate should fall with scale towards the high single-digit range, implying a company-wide operating margin of ~20%.That implies operating profits of $80 billion. After taking out interest and taxes, that could easily flow into $65 billion in net profits.The market’s historically average forward price-to-earnings ratio is 17. Based on that multiple, Tesla will be worth more than a trillion dollars by the 2030s.Considering Tesla is worth $400 billion today, the investment implication here is clear. TSLA stock should remain a core long-term holding for any and all investors with a multi-year time horizon.Tesla stock is a must-own, long-term winner, because clean energy is the future of the world, and Tesla is the unrivaled leader in clean energy solutions.It’s that simple.The third quarter earnings report confirms that the Tesla growth narrative is firing on all cylinders. So long as that remains true, stick with TSLA stock, and buy it on dips.On the date of publication, Luke Lango did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The New Daily 10X Stock Report: 98.7% Accuracy – Gains Up to 466.78%.

97,"Oct 26, 2020 12:08PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNasdaq stocks have performed well this year. The Nasdaq Composite has risen nearly 25% year-to-date. Investors should not be surprised given that the index is tech and internet heavy. Investors tend to hear about the outliers among the group, which perform extremely well or extremely poorly. Yet, these stories often represent a small sample of the entire exchange. The Nasdaq represents many companies. Indeed the Nasdaq exchange itself comprises over 3,300 stocks. The companies within the exchange are very much investment grade, as their strength during the novel coronavirus pandemic attests. Several of the names on this following list will be very familiar given their household name status. Others may be less well-known. Nonetheless, all of these stocks have performed well in 2020 and look to continue to do so. Here are seven of the best Nasdaq stocks to buy now despite 2020’s challenges:  Unfortunately, investors who picked up AAPL stock at the beginning of September are likely less than wild about it. It has depreciated about 11% in that time frame. However, despite the recent selloff in tech, the stock remains a strong performer, having risen 59% year-to-date. The next two years are going to mark a transition for Apple which should send prices higher. Back in June, Tim Cook announced that Apple will transition away from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) processors for its Mac series. Apple has developed its own Apple Silicon ARM processors. There are rumors that Apple will release its first Apple silicon Mac in November. Not only does this change the company’s supply chain and internal device hardware, but it also ushers in a new era. Apple has been long rumored to be contemplating developing chips. Now it is. This means that the next few years could see Apple operating in totally new sectors. The company has been a cash producing machine, and now it has the potential to branch out into areas that will power upcoming trends.  Tesla has flown incredibly high this year. It now trades well above $400 after nearly reaching $500 per share. Shares sold for under $100 to begin the year. Markets have adopted the idea of EVs wholesale, and Tesla has been the most visible beneficiary.Moreover the stock perfectly summarizes the growth vs. value argument in investing. From a fundamental perspective, there’s a lot to say that TSLA stock is one to avoid. Its valuation metrics include a price-to-earnings ratio of 1,144.97. This is an astronomically high number. Tesla’s price-to-sales ratio is worse than most of its peers in the automotive industry.Yet, that misses the point. One that markets have agreed with en masse. This company represents a paradigm shift and may well be one which defines the automotive industry for decades to come. It is going to remain the leader in EVs for many years to come. That’s the reward it gets for having pioneered this industry. Tesla delivered 139,300 vehicles in Q3. This breaks its previous record 0f 112,000 deliveries in Q3 ‘19.  Seagen, previously Seattle Genetics, is a biotech company that develops cancer therapeutics. Several of its therapeutics are being investigated in phase 3 trials for efficacy against a wide range of cancers. Of course, there are many biotechnology companies developing cancer therapeutics at various stages of clinical approval. So, why should investors be interested in Seagen specifically? The company achieved record sales of $240.5 million in Q2 from its three marketed therapeutics. It is on schedule to surpass $1 billion in revenues in 2020. These sales figures are key drivers of SGEN stock price appreciation this year. Year-to-date the stock has appreciated roughly 80%. As more of those clinical efficacy investigations pass through Food and Drug Administration approval, the company will have more avenues toward revenue. This of course opens up the ability for the company to fund new drug development. But for the short and mid terms, the company has plenty of revenue and growth with its current pipeline. Analyst sentiment regarding PayPal is strong. As a matter of fact, the vast majority of analysts covering PYPL stock rate it a buy. Target prices also range as high as $285 per share, which represents a near 40% price increase if purchased now. The company has risen to prominence over the past several years as a leader in the fintech space. The stock is highly valued with a P/E ratio above 90, yet it has shown year-over-year sales growth of about 20% over the past half decade. As a leader in the fintech/payments space there’s a lot of reason to believe it can climb.For example, its developments with Venmo make it stand out from other Nasdaq stocks.Specifically, Paypal owns Venmo, which is very popular among younger generations. Venmo’s app makes payments very simple and customizable. Ultimately Venmo makes Paypal itself more attractive as a stock. There’s a lot of potential for revenue increases from Venmo from current levels according to analysts:“Venmo now has more than 60 million active users … [Wolfe Research analyst Darrin Peller] estimates that the Venmo credit card, which includes 3% cash back on users’ highest-spending categories, could generate $200 a year per user, well above the $10 average for Venmo now. Every 1% of Venmo users who sign up for the card could equate to $150 million in annual revenue for PayPal.”All of these factors stack up in a way that makes PYPL stock stand out among its peers. MercadoLibre is a stock that readers may not have heard of. The company is an e-commerce platform headquartered in Argentina serving Latin America. Analysts are somewhat mixed on it but overall rate it a buy. The company has shown massive growth over the previous year, and serves an emerging market in Latin America as a whole. Furthermore, the company is undergoing a massive growth phase with many positive signals from its Q2 earnings report:Specifically, for investors who are interested in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), MELI stock is certainly a stock to consider. According to Statista, Latin America had 267.4 million ecommerce shoppers in 2019, which was forecast to increase by 31% by 2024. The same report also highlights the fact that the $70 billion of sales in the region in 2019 should grow to $116 billion by 2023.  Investors should consider CTXS stock for many reasons. It hasn’t risen massively, nor is it really “high flying.” Yet it could very well appreciate soon. The company helps organize personalized, digital work spaces. As such, the company focuses on automation and personalization, which allow employees to work anywhere. Of course this is becoming a bigger trend, which has been accelerated by the pandemic. Citrix Systems competes with Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) among others. In terms of value investing, Citrix is attractive vis-à-vis Adobe in that the latter carries a P/E ratio of 63.33x. CTXS stock carries a much lower P/E ratio of 23.35x, along with a higher WACC vs. ROIC ratio than Adobe. That means you pay less for a dollar of Citrix earnings by far. And the WACC vs. ROIC ratios of each respective company favors Citrix Systems. Adobe is more heavily favored by the markets as indicated by its high P/E ratio, but Citrix Systems has a big catalyst in the work from home trend. CTXS stock is relatively undervalued now, but if it can position itself as a leader in the eyes of the market, then it can capitalize on work trends.  CRSP stock represents the exciting arena of gene editing. The company is truly at the leading edge of science and scientific discovery. In fact, its co-founder, Emmanuelle Charpentier was recently awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for work on the CRISPR system. The CRISPR/Cas9 system allows for precise changes to be made to genomic DNA. This allows scientists to disrupt, delete, or insert information into the DNA helix. The applications of this tool are far reaching but currently include research for use in treating diabetes, muscular dystrophy, cancer and sickle-cell disease. CRISPR Therapeutics is currently enrolling patients in clinical trials for cancer and sickle-cell studies. Of course, it’s hard to know where this advancement in science will lead, but the potential seems massive. So despite financials which are not great — but not terrible either — CRSP stock could skyrocket over time. I personally like this stock because it represents a true paradigm shift. CRISPR is the pioneer in this field. Therefore, it should continue to develop scientific techniques that use the novel CRISPR/Cas9 system. Other companies are making strides in this area, but CRSP stock should benefit massively from its leading scientific position. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Alex Sirois is a freelance contributor to InvestorPlace whose personal stock investing style is focused on long-term, buy-and-hold, wealth-building stock picks.

98,"Oct 26, 2020 10:57AM EDT","Shares of electric-pickup start-up Lordstown Motors (NASDAQ: RIDE) opened higher in the company's first post-merger trading session on Monday morning. Lordstown completed its merger with DiamondPeak Holdings (NASDAQ: DPHC), a special-purpose acquisition company, late on Friday.As of 10 a.m. EDT, shares of the newly combined company were up about 10.9% from DiamondPeak's closing price on Friday. Lordstown said on Friday that its merger with DiamondPeak had closed as planned. The deal, which included a so-called ""PIPE"" (for ""private investment in public equity"") for investors including General Motors (NYSE: GM), left the merged company with about $675 million in net proceeds. Lordstown's electric pickup, called the Endurance, is designed to meet the needs of commercial-fleet operators. Image source: Lordstown Motors.In a statement, CEO Steve Burns said that sum should be enough to get the company's electric Endurance pickup into production. Lordstown owns a former General Motors assembly plant; GM has provided advice and assistance as Lordstown works to finalize the Endurance's design and prepare the factory to produce the truck. Auto investors have sharply bid up the stocks of several electric-vehicle start-ups this year, following Tesla's huge run-up in value in late 2019 and early 2020.

99,"Oct 26, 2020 9:20AM EDT","Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is set to begin shipping made-in-China sedans to Europe on Tuesday, according to a Chinese media report.Chinese government-backed news outlet The Paper reports on Monday that Tesla will ship about 7,000 Model 3s from its Shanghai factory to a port in Belgium for delivery to customers in countries throughout Europe. The ship carrying the Teslas will depart on Tuesday and is expected to arrive in late November, according to the report.Image source: The Motley Fool.It's the first time that Tesla has exported vehicles from its factory in China. Shanghai's deputy mayor, Chen Yin, who spoke at a ceremony to mark the occasion on Monday, said that Tesla's Shanghai factory, which opened late last year, is now producing between 3,500 and 4,000 Model 3 sedans per week. The company is in the process of building a second assembly line at the factory for the Model Y crossover SUV, Chen said.  Tesla's China chief, Zhu Xiotong, said that the Model 3s heading to Europe have the same battery life as its standard-specification Chinese-market models. The sedans have passed all of the European-market certification requirements, he said.Tesla's factory in Shanghai is the first auto factory in China to be built by a global automaker outside of a joint venture with a domestic Chinese automaker. The factory, located in a special ""free trade zone"" in Shanghai, has become a point of pride for local politicians because of the speed of its construction: It took less than a year for the factory to go from groundbreaking to the start of production. 10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

100,"Oct 26, 2020 7:45AM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThough they only date to the late 1980s, exchange traded funds, or ETFs, now rule the investment roost to the point where it’s hard imagine they never existed. One with quite the high profile is the Invesco S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF (NYSEARCA:SPHD). Linked as it is to stable high-yield Standard & Poor’s blue chips — specifically, those that offer dividends — SPHD stock won’t light up the party with fireworks. In fact, Kiplinger Senior Investing Editor Kyle Woodley described the constituent companies of SPHD as “a mostly boring group of stocks.” Right. So I get to write about this and somehow make it non-boring. Yowza.Yet since not all readers will know how ETFs work, the core advantages they offer and the factors that differentiate SPHD stock from others in this family, there’s hope for yours truly.Join me as I launch into a self-styled ETF — based on Entertaining, Timely and Fundamental information.So what are exchange traded funds? In essence, ETFs are securities that track a commodity, asset group (such as an index fund) or a given index (such as the S&P 500).Unlike a mutual fund, its net asset value isn’t calculated every day. Instead, it trades like a stock on an exchange and goes through price changes as ETFs get bought and sold. So if a given index or commodity does well, so does the ETF.In this case, “High Dividend Low Volatility” means exactly what it says. A share of SPHD stock, which currently trades for $34.44, buys you admission into a portfolio that’s broken up into leading categories such as utilities (18%), real estate (14%) and communications services (just above 11%). In fact, those represent the three top-ranking sectors in this ETF.But those pieces of the pie need not remain static. Once upon a springtime 2020, SPHD stock had significant holdings in energy (14%). Today, you’ll see that cut by more than half to 6.6%, a smart reshuffling given how much that particular sector has dried up.As you stifle a yawn, I’m going to guess you’re thinking, “Hrumpf. This ain’t no Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX) or any other 2020 stud.”Of course not. Every portfolio needs stability and that’s what this ETF promises. Does it deliver, though?Given the nature of dividend stocks, a 10,000-ft. view is in order. Those who bought SPHD stock mid-January 2016 realized a 39% gain exactly four years later. For a conservative play, that’s a tasty payday.It should come as no surprise that this ETF did a swan dive between mid-February and mid-March, given how the novel coronavirus shook Wall Street. But from its March 23 trough of $25.66, SPHD stock has since shot up 34%.Those with nerves of titanium who saw the first quarter market bottom as a buying opportunity have largely reaped benefits across the board. Those who bought SPHD have proven no exception.Longtime holders of SPHD stock have a right to complain that over the course of five years, share prices have amounted to pancake flat. Yet given the state of the economy and the markets, such investors should go easy on themselves.Certain sectors — again, energy comes to mind — have fared much worse. Take the pandemic out of the equation and this investment has a sweet track record.True, any stock on the upswing begs the question, “Am I buying in too late?” In this case, I don’t think so. The last six months or so amount to a reset time, and if you can buy SPHD stock at the same price it fetched in late 2015, I’d call that a bargain.Speaking of reset buttons, the high-flying stocks that so often make headlines have skewed the expectations (and stoked the greed) of many. Buying into this ETF will provide some rock solid goodness to your portfolio.Exchange traded funds also offer minuscule fees and you can rest assured that as the asset classes go, so goes the aggregating stock.The market may no longer be bullish and perhaps not so much bearish. Given the investment zoo we currently inhabit, I’d count on SPHD stock to sit in between: a rhino, if you will. Think about it. Rhinos are extremely sedentary. They can hang out on the same turf for days and days. But when pushed to do so, a charging rhino (34 mph) can outrun any scared investor (28 mph).Hey! I just invested a new investment term!!! Not that anyone’s gonna flip for it. Or use it. But that’s what you get when the writer shoots for non-boring. At least I deserve a chance, as SPHD stock does. I know, you know, rhino: now go go go and buy while the buying’s low.On the date of publication, Lou Carlozo did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.The post You Could Do Worse Than SPHD Stock as Your Entry Into ETFs appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/you-could-do-worse-than-sphd-stock-as-your-entry-into-etfs-2020-10-26

101,"Oct 26, 2020 6:31AM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsElectric vehicle maker Nio (NASDAQ:NIO) is becoming a popular stock in the United States without delivering a car on these shores. At the same time, shares of Nio stock have been climbing despite the company’s consistent losses. Both of these trends will likely continue.The lack of a profit apparently doesn’t faze investors who see that, despite its losses, investing in Nio stock is investing in an increasingly viable future for transportation.With that in mind, they place some of their money as a bet on the Chinese company’s prospects as the electric-vehicle trend gathers steam, so to speak.My InvestorPlace colleague Lou Carlozo recently described this as “Niomania.”Once upon a time, the basic expectation was that profits would be earned before investors would reward the company by pushing the share price higher. It was sort of like the Law of Gravity. Sure, you can defy gravity but the task requires energy and momentum.However, like childhood stories that begin with that well-known phrase, reality is different. Today’s market rewards several companies whose earnings haven’t made it to the green zone.And, in the electric vehicle category, the lack of a profit is verging on tradition. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a prominent home-grown example. Investors haven’t let the rare taste of profitability get in their way.Meanwhile, the company is delivering cool cars and SUVs as it pioneers the way for electric vehicles to become more mainstream in this country. Sand, to be sure, Tesla is far ahead of other EV hopefuls seeking to enter the U.S. market, including the established names.In August, Nio said it lost about 16 cents per share during the second quarter. The forecast for the third quarter is a loss of about $1.23 per share.October has been a trick-or-treat month for Nio stock. On Oct. 16, shares posted a 52-week high of $29.40 after several weeks of steady climbing. Interestingly, the stock’s 52-week low was $1.36, which was posted on Oct. 30, 2019. No doubt investors are happier with the more recent treat.One reason investors aren’t sweating the losses at this point is Nio is an emerging company working in an emerging transportation segment.Internal combustion engines have reliably powered vehicles for a long time. But that doesn’t the quest for something better won’t alter the long-term picture. Because this is exactly what is happening. Increasingly, electric vehicles are appealing alternatives with performance, operational savings and no pollution.In comparison to the U.S., China is on its way to mainstream electric vehicles. Nio aims to dominate this market, and the company seems to be building the momentum to succeed.Here’s an example. During the aforementioned second quarter, Nio delivered 10,331 vehicles. This was a significant increase (nearly 200%) from the same period a year ago, and an impressive production gain from the first quarter’s 3,831 vehicles.When I last wrote about Nio, I said its efforts go beyond making cars. The company has shrewdly developed a mass market brand that includes a social component that is very appealing to younger up-and-coming car buyers.These customers are plentiful in China’s growing economy. And they enjoy the Nio House locations with co-work spaces and areas to socialize. The company also has a successful fashion lineup that strengthens ties with the vehicle brand.Nio also is addressing the issue of charging the batteries. It has a monthly lease system referred to here as a “battery-as-a-service” program. Participants have access to a network of stations where specially-trained Nio crews will remove the depleted battery and replace it with one fully charged. This replacement is completed in a matter of minutes.Not only does this service reinforce customer loyalty to Nio, the leasing program also is a source of recurring revenue for the company.Shanghai-based Nio is an electric vehicle producer serving the premium market in China with cars and SUVs that boast style and innovation.Investors in the U.S. can buy shares in the company and lately, Nio stock has been gaining altitude. Nio is global in its approach, with sections of the company based in several countries, including a software division in San Jose, California.Last August, I wrote that Nio was a good candidate for a long-term portfolio and that assessment continues today. The company appears to be doing many things right.On the date of publication, Larry Sullivan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.Larry Sullivan is a veteran journalist in Florida who has covered banking and finance for several years.

102,"Oct 25, 2020 11:32PM EDT","By Yilei Sun and Brenda GohBEIJING/SHANGHAI, Oct 26 (Reuters) - An electric vehicle (EV) factory planned by Chinese automaking group Geely GEELY.UL will produce cars under the premium Polestar marque, two people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Monday.Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co Ltd plans to build a plant with annual manufacturing capacity of 30,000 premium EVs in the western city of Chongqing, run by a wholly owned, newly registered company, showed documents on its website.Geely and Polestar declined to comment on the marque.The plan comes as foreign automakers including BMW AG BMWG.DE and Tesla Inc TSLA.O expand EV production in the world's biggest market, sourcing major EV components such as batteries locally and often exporting the end product.Hangzhou-based Geely is China's most internationally known automaker. It owns Volvo Cars and Lotus, almost half of Proton and 9.7% of Daimler AG DAIGn.DE. Its Hong Kong-listed Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd 0175.HK is planning a Shanghai float.Through wholly owned company Polestar, it builds low-volume Polestar 1 hybrid performance cars in the western city of Chengdu and Polestar 2 volume sedans in Taizhou in the east.It also plans to begin production of the Precept sedan, displayed at this year's China auto show.Polestar aims to eventually offer bigger, more sporty vehicles at its showrooms, which currently span nine countries and whose number it plans to raise to 45 from 23 by year-end.Polestar Chief Executive Thomas Ingenlath told Reuters the firm is scouting markets in Asia-Pacific and the Middle East.

103,"Oct 25, 2020 11:41AM EDT","Though there's still more than two months left to 2020, that hasn't stopped Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) analysts from trying to start making estimates on the electric-car maker's potential growth in 2021. During the company's third-quarter earnings call last week, an analyst took a stab at getting CEO Elon Musk to talk about vehicle delivery expectations for next year -- and he succeeded.As it turns out, Tesla may be positioned for massive growth in vehicle deliveries in 2021 -- and the automaker has the installed production capacity to back it up.Vehicle production at Tesla's factory in Fremont, California. Image source: The Motley Fool.After explaining how he arrived at his estimate, New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu he believed Tesla could deliver between 840,000 to one million cars in 2021 -- up from the projected 500,000 units the company is expected to deliver this year.When asked whether he was on the right track, Musk responded saying, ""I mean, it's in that vicinity. Yes. You're not far off.""To put this potential growth into perspective, consider it in percentage terms compared to the 500,000 vehicles Tesla is aiming to deliver this year. Growing deliveries from 500,000 in 2020 to 850,000 in 2021 implies 70% year over year growth. One million deliveries next year, of course, would translate to 100% growth (again assuming Tesla delivers 500,000 vehicles in 2020.But are these realistic expectations?There's actually a rational case for this analyst's projections. As the analyst pointed out when explaining the reasoning for his forecast, the automaker has already installed enough production capacity to produce nearly 850,000 cars per year.Tesla broke down this capacity in its third-quarter shareholder letter. The company's production lines at its Fremont, California factory can produce 90,0000 combined Model S and X units per year and 500,000 combined Model 3 and Y units. Tesla's new Shanghai factory has the capacity for 250,000 Model 3 vehicles annually.Meanwhile, Tesla's Model Y factories in both Berlin, Germany and Austin, Texas are both under construction. In addition, the company is building a production line for Model Y in Shanghai. Given Tesla's recent accelerated pace at bringing factories and new production lines online, it wouldn't be surprising to see production at these factories begin in meaningful volumes next year.While Tesla could run into some unexpected detours, the company's recent execution and its expansion plans suggest Tesla will likely see accelerated growth next year.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

104,"Oct 25, 2020 9:18AM EDT","Two leaders are emerging in autonomous driving and they may not be the companies you first think of in that space. Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) Waymo subsidiary and General Motors' (NYSE: GM) Cruise are both going to start sending out their test vehicles unmanned by the end of the year, pulling the backup drivers that have been a staple thus far. Dozens of automakers from Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) to BMW have been adding driver-assistance features that are leading toward autonomy, but none have reached fully autonomous functionality yet. And most automakers haven't put their prototype systems through their paces in millions of miles of real-world road tests with only an emergency backup driver, so Waymo and Cruise are ahead of the pack in that respect. Now that those drivers are being pulled, the two giants can really begin to build their fully autonomous business models, and that's where the true innovation is going to take place. Image source: Cruise.Waymo will first pull its backup drivers from cars operating in a 50-square-mile area of Phoenix while Cruise plans to send its unmanned driverless vehicles out on the road in the difficult San Francisco area. While autonomous driving alone is a key milestone, it isn't the end goal. The ultimate goal is to use this new technology to power autonomous ridesharing businesses, which have multibillion-dollar potential. Waymo is reportedly going to start allowing its vehicles to carry passengers this year, and Cruise has plans to launch its Origin self-driving vehicle, which is built specifically for ridesharing. It's this type of disruption that all the companies in this race are building toward in the auto industry.Let's just do some back-of-the-napkin calculations to show how big a market these autonomous businesses could eventually be, starting with the following assumptions: Given these assumptions and the 3.225 trillion miles driven in the U.S. in 2018, the most recent data available, 10 years from now, an autonomous rideshare company could generate $32.3 billion in revenue annually.Keep in mind, too, that these companies are making the drivers unnecessary and (in Cruise's case) building electric vehicles that cost less to operate than traditional vehicles, so this has the potential to be a higher margin business than today's ride-hailing services. To put that financial performance into context, that's more revenue than Uber or Lyft generate in a year. But given their lower costs and a decade to grow, it's reasonable to expect that one of these businesses could be carrying passengers on 1% of their road-travel miles -- or more. UBER Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsWhat I'm trying to underscore here is that the launch of fully autonomous ridesharing businesses in major U.S. cities is a big deal. Over the next decade, this could be an enormous opportunity, and Waymo and Cruise are clearly a step ahead of the competition. As investors, we can't own Waymo or Cruise directly yet, but we can own their parent companies. Alphabet owns Waymo outright and GM owns about 69% of Cruise, but GM clearly has the most upside from an investment standpoint. A 69% stake in a business with the kind of assumed revenue numbers above would move the needle much more for GM's stock than Alphabet's. GM Market Cap data by YChartsAlphabet has proportionally less upside to gain from Waymo just because of its sheer size, but even so, it could be a big addition to the tech giant's business. While many companies are investing in autonomous driving and starting to build out their business models in the space, Waymo and Cruise appear to have a leg up on the competition. Their vehicles are built to be fully autonomous, and the companies are already developing ridesharing platforms that could upend the economics of vehicle ownership. GM has the most upside potential from an investment standpoint, but don't count out how important Waymo could be to keep Alphabet's long-term growth story alive. Both companies have a lot to look forward to now that they'll have fully autonomous vehicles on the road. 10 stocks we like better than General MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

105,"Oct 24, 2020 10:46AM EDT","General Motors (NYSE: GM) made a splash this week when its GMC brand revived its hummer with all-new guts: battery-powered electric motors. The truck's specs were impressive. The top-end version of the new hummer will boast 350-plus miles of range on a single charge, the equivalent of 1,000 horsepower, and a zero to 60 miles per hour (mph) acceleration time of less than three seconds. Available in late 2021, the new truck appears aimed directly at Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) Cybertruck, which is slated to start production late next year. With GMC's new hummer fresh on everyone's minds, Tesla CEO Elon Musk was sure to weigh in during the electric-car maker's earnings call this week with an update on the Cybertruck -- and the CEO seemed as confident as ever that the new vehicle won't disappoint.Cybertruck. Image source: Tesla.""[T]here's like a lot of small improvements compared to what was unveiled,"" said Musk about the Cybertruck during Tesla's third-quarter earnings call. ""I think it's going to be better than what we showed.""Unfortunately, Musk didn't provide any specifics. Nevertheless, that's a pretty high bar, as Tesla shared some pretty wild specs for the vehicle when it was unveiled late last year. The fully loaded tri-motor version of the Cybertruck will boast a zero to 60 mph time of less than 2.9 seconds, over 500 miles of driving range, and a towing capacity of more than 14,000 pounds. It will also come standard with Autopilot technology, the company said when the vehicle was first shown off. There may be ""some Cybertruck deliveries toward the end of next year,"" Musk says. In 2022, however, ""there's probably a lot of deliveries,"" he added.There was no mention of GMC's new electric hummer during the earnings call -- either from analysts or Musk.Though the Cybertruck design took many people aback at first glance, it apparently warmed up to at least several hundred thousand people. Over the weekend following the truck's unveiling, Tesla racked up 200,000 reservations for Cybertruck. A few months after the truck's unveiling, Tesla said the demand for the vehicle was greater than it had seen for any vehicle previously.Image source: Getty Images.""I think ... we'll sell as many as we can make, it's going to be pretty nuts,"" Musk said in the company's fourth-quarter 2019 earnings call.Of course, it's no secret that there's a massive market for pickup trucks. Ford has shipped over 40 million F-150's over the past 60 years.

106,"Oct 24, 2020 9:05AM EDT","Don't look now, but solar energy stocks are crushing the market -- and fossil fuel stocks -- in 2020. This follows years of underperformance by most solar energy stocks and a year when it was feared that the pandemic would grind the industry to a halt. But instead of folding under the pressure of economic uncertainty, solar stocks have exploded. There are a few reasons why, and it's worth understanding what's sustainable in the coming years and could keep driving solar stocks higher. FSLR data by YChartsIn the spring, there was some worry that the COVID-19 pandemic would be a huge burden for the solar industry in 2020. Residential solar sales could be impacted because companies wouldn't be able to sell door-to-door, manufacturing could be shut down, and costs could rise to keep workers and customers safe. But that's not what happened. In fact, the construction industry has been booming in 2020, so residential solar has been relatively strong. Outdoor working conditions have also been deemed relatively safe, so solar projects around the world have gone on as planned as well. The pandemic has also brought about some innovations that were a long time coming for solar energy. One, in particular, is that residential solar companies were forced to make more sales with digital tools. SunPower (NASDAQ: SPWR) is one of the leaders in this digital-first approach, but Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has also pulled all of its door-to-door staff in favor of online sales. Even Sunrun (NASDAQ: RUN) is adapting to the new reality with fewer physical touchpoints with consumers during the sales process. Image source: Getty Images.It's also not a surprise that solar stocks have gone up as presidential candidate Joe Biden has taken a clear polling lead over President Trump. Biden has clearly put more of a focus on clean energy than Trump, despite not being a supporter of the ""Green New Deal"", so the perception is that he'll be good for the industry. Even if Biden supports more favorable policies toward the solar industry, it isn't like the last four years have been bad for solar energy. You can see below that solar energy production has grown exponentially for a decade, and is up nearly 300% in the last five years alone. US Solar Energy Production data by YChartsPolitics can often drive traders into and out of industries, so it's a reason solar stocks are up this year. But politics has not typically been a driver of the fundamental financial health of solar companies, which is ultimately what's helping solar stocks in 2020. At the end of the day, the reason solar stocks are up this year is that financial performance is improving. Below is a chart of revenue and gross margins for Canadian Solar (NASDAQ: CSIQ), JinkoSolar (NYSE: JKS), SolarEdge (NASDAQ: SEDG), and Enphase Energy (NASDAQ: ENPH), four of the biggest equipment suppliers in the industry. Not only did we not see a decline in revenue from the pandemic, but some companies are also seeing margins increase. CSIQ Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsThe financial improvement comes after the industry made a number of moves to focus more on small segments of the market rather than vertically integrating. For example, SunPower has sold or spun off its development business, inverter manufacturing, and its solar manufacturing arm. The result has been better financial results and better margins almost across the board. Solar stocks may be up big this year, but they're not running out of room to run. The industry is still expected to grow as the cost of power from solar panels falls and replaces fossil fuel as a preferred new source of electricity. Manufacturers and installers also have room to expand margins after years of breakeven results or even losses.  The industry has gone through boom and bust cycles before and that's not out of the questions, but what's different now is there are fewer competitors and companies are more focused on a specific segment of the market rather than competing up and down the value chain. As a result, I think solar energy stocks still have a lot of room to grow and may stay the hottest in energy in 2021. This is the future of energy, and the companies I've mentioned are building businesses that could be consequential for our energy use for decades to come. 10 stocks we like better than SunPowerWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Investors endured a miserable 2019 as the company increased spending to build out its infrastructure, automate internal systems, and expand residential delivery. That investment has paid off in strong earnings so far this year, and FedEx and other shippers are already saying they expect to be at capacity this holiday season.Most of the gains so far in 2020 have been playing catch-up after issues in 2019. FedEx shares, even after nearly doubling, still trade at a substantial discount to archrival United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS). FedEx currently has an enterprise value 13.7 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), considerably less than UPS's 18.8 times multiple.FedEx in the quarters to come will get better utilization of its assets as it shifts to seven-day-a-week deliveries, and should enjoy strong pricing power during this holiday season. There's ample room to boost margins and improve cash flow, which should help the stock to close the gap with UPS.FedEx has covered a lot of miles in 2020, but the stock remains in the fast lane.John Rosevear (General Motors): Investors obsessed with Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) dizzying climb have made poor old GM seem like yesterday's (or last century's) news. But there are some very good reasons to be taking a closer look at GM's stock right now.Self-driving taxis? GM's Cruise subsidiary is getting closer and closer to that reality. Image source: General Motors.Here's the big takeaway: After several years of patient work, auto investors are finally starting to view GM not as a dying dinosaur, but as a company leading the way into the future. GM's stock is still cheap, in large part because of the coronavirus disruptions we've all been working through in 2020. But if CEO Mary Barra and her team continue to execute as well as they have recently, the stock should move up nicely over the next couple of years. Rich Smith (Bloom Energy): Hydrogen-this and fuel cells-that. Hydrogen, hydrogen, HY-drogen! It seems a day doesn't go by without someone or other hyping the ""hydrogen economy"" and how it's going to change our world. One day soon, goes the story, all of our factories, cars, and long-haul semis will be running on hydrogen-powered fuel cells that contribute nothing to global warming, and produce no byproduct more serious than chemically pure H2O.But here's the thing: I've been following the fuel cell industry for well over the last 15 years, and in pretty much any year you could name, I could find you a quote from some analyst or other predicting that fuel cells would be ubiquitous ""in 10 years.""Meanwhile, the last 15 years have seen hydrogen pioneers Ballard Power Systems (NASDAQ: BLDP), FuelCell Energy (NASDAQ: FCEL), and Plug Power (NASDAQ: PLUG) produce nothing but GAAP losses and negative free cash flow -- and the ""hydrogen economy"" is still at least 10 years away.Fact is, at this point there's only one fuel cell company I would even consider investing in, and it's Bloom Energy.Although eclipsed by Ballard and Plug in this year of wild dreams and inflated stock prices, Bloom Energy remains by far the biggest fuel cell maker and hydrogen producer by sales, generating more than $780 million in sales over the past year. Like its peers, Bloom is not yet profitable (a big reason why I don't own even it yet), but Bloom generated positive free cash flow last year -- $112 million -- a feat none of its peers has ever accomplished.Viable businesses need to generate their own cash by selling their own products -- not just selling an ever-increasing pile of shares to gullible investors. Out of the entire hydrogen industry, Bloom Energy seems to me the only stock with even a passing chance of doing that -- because it already has.10 stocks we like better than General MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

108,"Oct 24, 2020 6:31AM EDT","Picture it: You want to save for retirement, and you'd like to be invested in lots of huge and growing companies like Apple, Amazon.com, Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, and Facebook. But you don't have that much money right now, and you don't want to have to follow the companies that closely, as you should really do when investing in individual companies.Here's a solution: Park a bunch of your retirement dollars in the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (NASDAQ: QQQ).Image source: Getty Images.The Invesco QQQ Trust is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) -- a mutual fund-like security that trades throughout the day like a stock, and in which you can buy as little as one share. Many mutual funds require initial investments of $3,000 or more, and many companies in which you may want to invest trade at steep prices per share: Amazon, for example, was recently trading above $3,200 per share, while Alphabet's price topped $1,600. In contrast, one share of the Invesco QQQ Trust recently traded at about $285 per share.What, exactly, is the QQQ? It's an index fund based on the Nasdaq-100 index, which, as Invesco explains, ""includes 100 of the largest domestic and international nonfinancial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market based on market capitalization."" (It adds that ""the Fund and the Index are rebalanced quarterly and reconstituted annually."") The table below shows the top 10 companies in the index (and, therefore, in the ETF). As you can see, it's weighted by market capitalization, so the biggest companies make up the lion's share of its value.CompanyRecent Weighting in ETFApple13.2%Microsoft10.8%Amazon10.7%Alphabet6.9%Facebook4.2%Tesla3.4%NVIDIA2.8%Adobe2%PayPal2%Netflix2%Source: Slickcharts.com, as of Oct. 20, 2020. Indeed, just Apple and Microsoft together make up 24% of the fund's value -- almost a quarter of it. Add in the next four companies, and you're at almost 50% of the fund. There's good and bad to this: If you are excited by the prospects of the ""FAANG"" stocks -- Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google (now organized as Alphabet) -- this is a quick and easy way to own all five of them, plus 95 other companies.A downside, though, is that if one of those major holdings falters, it will have an outsized effect on the fund's performance. And if you have high hopes for the 37th and 85th companies in the index, they are held in such small proportion that they won't be moving the needle easily.So the focus of the ETF is really those top few companies, and they do hold a lot of long-term promise. Consider, for example, that Alphabet not only owns Google, but also YouTube, Nest, and Waze. Facebook, meanwhile, owns Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, while Microsoft owns LinkedIn, Skype, and many other businesses. Amazon, of course, is a huge online retailer, but it's also a major cloud-computing entity with its Amazon Web Services, which recently generated about half of the company's operating profits. Oh, and Amazon also owns Whole Foods, Audible, IMDb, GoodReads, and Zappos, among other things.So can the QQQ really get you to millionaire-hood? Well, there are no guarantees in the stock investing world, but the index does have a strong track record. It came to life 21 years ago, in March of 1999, and since then it has averaged an annual growth rate of 9.1% -- better than the overall Nasdaq average of 7.4% and the Russell 3000's 6.9%. (The Russell 3000 is an index that tracks just about all of the U.S. stock market.) Over the past 10 years, the QQQ has averaged annual gains of 20.4%, versus 16.8% for the Nasdaq and 13.5% for the Russell 3000.We can't know how the index will perform in the coming few years or the coming 20 years, but the table below shows some possibilities if you invest $10,000 in the QQQ annually over various periods:Growing forGrowing at 5%Growing at 10%Growing at 15%10 years$132,068$175,312$233,49315 years$226,575$349,497$547,17520 years$347,193$630,025$1.2 million25 years$501,135$1.1 million$2.4 million30 years$697,608$1.8 million$5 millionSource: Calculations  by author.You may not be able to sock away $10,000 every year, and you may not average 15% or even 10% annual growth, but you'll still likely build up considerable assets over time.Of course, the QQQ is not the only index fund worth considering. You might want to go broader -- or narrower -- or spread your money across several indexes. You can invest in the entire Nasdaq composite index of more than 2,600 companies via any of the index mutual funds and ETFs that track it, such as the Fidelity Nasdaq Composite Index Fund (NASDAQMUTFUND: FNCMX).Then there's the much newer Nasdaq Next Gen 100 ETF (NASDAQ: QQQJ), focusing on the ""next generation"" of exciting growth stocks that exist in areas such as software-as-a-service and digital transformation. Here's how Invesco describes the index fund: ""The Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 Fund ... is based on the NASDAQ Next Generation 100 Index ... The Index is comprised of securities of the next generation of Nasdaq-listed non-financial companies; that is, the largest 100 Nasdaq-listed companies outside of the NASDAQ-100 Index.""Be sure to not put all your eggs in any one investing bucket, unless it's a very broad bucket, such as one that tracks the S&P 500 or the entire U.S. stock market. Sticking with index funds is a reasonable strategy, and you might include some that focus on dividend-paying stocks and international stocks, perhaps along with some bond-focused funds.As long as you have a decade or more before you retire, you may be able to amass a lot more money than you thought -- just approach it rationally, with reasonable expectations.10 stocks we like better than Invesco QQQ TrustWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

109,"Oct 23, 2020 4:00PM EDT","When it reported strong third-quarter earnings on Wednesday, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) delighted investors. The week, however, is ending on a less auspicious note for the automaker with its announcement that it's recalling almost 50,000 vehicles that it exported to China. At issue are potential defects in the suspensions of 29,193 Model S and Model X vehicles manufactured in the U.S. between Sept. 17, 2013, and Aug. 16, 2017, as well as 19,249 Model S vehicles produced between Sept. 17, 2013, and Oct. 15, 2018.According to Gasgoo, a Chinese website that reports on that nation's auto industry, China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) is requesting that the carmaker replace the rear linkages of the left and right front suspension and the upper linkages of the left and right rear suspension for all affected vehicles at no cost to the vehicles' owners.Image source: Getty Images.While China is insistent that Tesla attend to the alleged safety issue, the company has voiced its opposition to the recall. In a letter sent to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that Electrek, a website that focuses on the electric transportation industry, obtained, Elizabeth H. Mykytiuk, Tesla's managing counsel for regulatory affairs, implied that China had left the company with little choice in the matter. Mykytiuk stated:""Due to the opinion of SAMR/DPAC that the topic required a recall in the China market, Tesla was left with the choice of either voluntarily recalling the subject vehicles or carrying a heavy burden through the Chinese administrative process. While Tesla disagrees with the opinion of SAMR/DPAC, the Company has decided not to dispute a recall for the China market only.""Furthermore, Mykytiuk contends that the alleged issue is not reflective of any defect in the vehicles' parts or manufacture, but rather that it stems from ""driver abuse"" in how people operate the vehicles. 10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

110,"Oct 23, 2020 3:20PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith the pedal to the metal, electric vehicle stocks show no signs of slowing. In fact, most could see far more upside including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Nio (NYSE:NIO), and most notably, Workhorse Group (NASDAQ:WKHS) and WKHS stock.The last time I weighed in on the stock, I said, “While the shares won’t explode overnight, I strongly believe that they could double. I said the same thing as the stock traded at $17.03 before it ran to nearly $31 a share.”Granted, the stock recently pulled back after the U.S. Postal Service delayed its contract decision, but there’s still opportunity here. Remember, just because the contract was delayed doesn’t mean Workhorse Group is out of the running.The WKHS stock could still run higher again on the anticipation of a coming decision.After all, the postal service is still in desperate need of upgrading its ancient fleet of vehicles. And Workhorse Group is still in the running. From here, I strongly believe the WKHS stock could rally back to nearly $31 a share again soon.I also wouldn’t get too wound up over the recent downgrade from Roth Capital’s Craig Irwin. He recently downgraded WKHS stock from a buy to a hold, with a target cut to $27. While the contract was delayed, it’s a temporary setback.Weakness in the stock is a buy opportunity, in my opinion.And sure, according to the postal service, as quoted by Barron’s said, “Due to the current Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on Postal Service and supplier operations, an award(s) is currently planned for the production phase by the end of the calendar year.”But, as noted by Barron’s contributor Al Root, “The potential addition of an “s” to award is significant. It raises the possibility of multiple winners. That’s good for Workhorse’s business because it raises the odds of success.”In addition, while it’s not a certainty Workhorse will win the postal service contract, investors can still make money on the stock on the anticipatory momentum. For example, buy now and simply wait for the momentum to build up ahead of the contract date.Tesla just blew earnings out of the water, with hopes of selling half a million EVs this year. EPS of 76 cents was well above expectations for 57 cents. Revenue of $8.77 billion was above estimates for $8.36 billion. That’s only creating even more excitement over EV stocks.Helping, General Motors (NYSE:GM) just announced it would invest $2.2 billion in U.S. manufacturing to increase EV production.  Better, governments around the world are forcing millions into EVs. In the U.S. for example, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed an executive order that will ban the sale of gas-powered passenger cars in the state starting in 2035. That’s further fuel for the EV boom.In short, the electric vehicle boom has only started. With it, we could see further upside in related stocks like Workhorse Group easily. This is another reason to buy WKSH stock on weakness.Over the last month, Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch said WKHS stock was a leader in last-mile deliveries. He has a price target of $23.And, as I noted on Sept. 25, “Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne is impressed by WKHS stock.“The [second half production] ramp remains on track and management continues to target [making] 300 [to] 400 vehicles by the end of the year. After a tough few quarters, we see greener pastures ahead.”While I don’t expect the stock to explode overnight, I still believe we could see $31 again soon. The postal service contract is still on the table. It was only delayed, not canceled. Use recent weakness as an opportunity to buy.On the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. Ian Cooper, an InvestorPlace.com contributor, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.

111,"Oct 23, 2020 3:13PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn Wednesday afternoon, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock traded higher after the company reported third-quarter earnings. But Tesla shares often have a mind of their own. So it’s always a good idea to sit down and take an objective look at the numbers.I’ve been a TSLA stock skeptic for a long time. But I’ll be the first to admit that the company’s third-quarter numbers look pretty good. Tesla’s business clearly seems to be on the right track given it is finally delivering profits and actual growth.Unfortunately, as expected, there was absolutely nothing in Tesla’s third quarter that justifies a more than 700% increase in market cap compared to a year ago. As impressive as Tesla’s third quarter was, investors still shouldn’t be gambling with TSLA stock at its current valuation.Given the insane rally in TSLA stock in the past year, it’s safe to say most Tesla investors are much more about the long-term Tesla story than the quarterly numbers. But those quarterly numbers will ultimately dictate the long-term story.Tesla reported third-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 76 cents, beating consensus analyst estimates of 57 cents. Revenue of $8.77 billion also topped analyst expectations of $8.36 billion. In the same quarter a year ago, Tesla reported EPS of 37 cents and revenue of $6.3 billion. Revenue in the third quarter was up 39% compared to a year ago. Previously reported vehicle deliveries for the third quarter were 139,300, up 53.6% compared to the second quarter.Auto gross margins in the quarter were 27.7%, up 2.3% from last quarter and 4.9% from a year ago. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.395 billion, up 276% from a year ago.Tesla also slightly decreased its reliance on regulatory credit sales. Tesla reported $397 million in regulatory credit sales, down 7% compared to the second quarter. However, for the fourth consecutive quarter, profits from regulatory credit sales accounted for more than 100% of Tesla’s net income on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis. This regulatory credit income will eventually drop to zero as competitors roll out their own electric vehicles in coming years.In a nutshell, Tesla’s quarter was maybe the most impressive quarter in recent memory for the company. However, the company is still struggling to generate meaningful profits, even when relying heavily on regulatory credits.In my opinion, Tesla should get a lot of credit for reporting a profitable quarter in a difficult environment. But the company is going to have to do a lot better to justify upside for the stock at a market cap of nearly $400 billion.Once you get past the growth numbers, the reality check for TSLA stock is always its valuation. Tesla originally said it would easily deliver 500,000 vehicles in 2020. CEO Elon Musk recently dialed back those expectations to a range of between 477,750 to 514,500 deliveries.In 2019, General Motors (NYSE:GM) delivered 7.7 million vehicles, or about 15 times what Tesla hopes to deliver this year. Yet somehow Tesla’s market cap of $393 billion is about 7.7 times the size of GM’s at around $51 billion.TSLA stock bulls like to argue that Tesla is more like a high-growth tech stock than an auto stock. I recently compared Tesla’s valuation to both auto peers and high-growth big tech peers like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).At 128x forward earnings and 15.6x  sales, TSLA stock is overvalued no matter which group you compare it to.I’m happy TSLA stock investors got the big quarter they were hoping for. Unfortunately, Tesla’s crazy bubble valuation still makes the stock closer to a casino bet than a sound long-term investment.If Tesla keeps putting up the kind of numbers it put up in the third quarter for the next 10 or 15 years, it will eventually grow into its valuation. But no investor wants to wait out a decade of potential underperformance while a company’s fundamentals catch up to its stock price. Even if Tesla is the next Apple, Apple hasn’t had a single year in the past 20 in which it had an annual gain of more than 201%. TSLA stock is up 737% in the past year.Tesla investors must face the fact that the stock has been caught in an electric vehicle bubble. The company’s third-quarter numbers suggest it’s on the right track for long-term growth. But the stock is just as likely to drop 50% in the next several years than it is to gain 50%. Its valuation comes from a story, not a business. If the story doesn’t play out exactly the way investors anticipate, the stock could drop. If investors find another story they like better, the stock could drop.Tesla put together a great quarter, but there’s no need to gamble by buying at these levels. I’m not going long or short TSLA stock any time soon.On the date of publication, Wayne Duggan held a long position in GM.Wayne Duggan has been a U.S. News & World Report Investing contributor since 2016 and is a staff writer at Benzinga, where he has written more than 7,000 articles.

112,"Oct 23, 2020 2:50PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis year, there a dizzying number of special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) going public, many of which have ties to the electric vehicle (EV) industry. Switchback Energy (NYSE:SBE) isn’t among that group because it’s initial public offering took place last year, but SBE stock could prove to be one of the SPAC stars of the EV space.In the current EV landscape, it’s not a stretch to say investors are looking for the next Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) or Nio (NYSE:NIO). That’s human nature. We’re always looking for the next great stock, athlete, consumer fad, etc.In fairness to many SPACs addressing the EV industry, these blank-check firms conquered one mountain, which is finding a target to bring public. That’s great for their investors and the acquired company. However, many of the EV blank-check deals appear a tad dubious because the target companies aren’t producing vehicles yet. And some aren’t particularly close to doing so.A manufacturer aspiring to tussle with Tesla actually has to make something to get in the game and flex its competitive muscles.Switchback is acquiring Chargepoint, which could, over time, avail itself to be one of the more viable ideas in the EV investment realm. The reasoning here is simple. Chargepoint won’t be butting heads with manufacturers. It won’t be making electric vehicles at all. Rather, Chargepoint is an infrastructure play. And a pertinent one at that.The California-based company operates the largest network of EV charging stations – 115,000 to be precise. Think of Chargepoint as the gas station company for a new breed of automobiles. The benefit with that status is that, unlike so many EV SPACs, Chargepoint doesn’t carry the risks associated with a typical pre-revenue company.One way of looking at Chargepoint/SBE stock is that the former addresses one of the primary concerns associated with EV ownership: Range. Battery technology is evolving and EV manufacturers are prioritizing increased range. However, the manufacturers can’t do all the heavy lifting themselves. Road trips are ingrained in American culture and at some point, infrastructure must evolve to support EV adoption. Enter Chargepoint.It’s estimated that by 2025, more than 7 million EV charging ports will be needed, but nearly 5 million will be available. Chargepoint is expected to operate roughly half those ports in 2025.Chargepoint’s revenue growth forecasts reflect the opportunity in the charging infrastructure market. Solidifying its status as the dominant player in this segment, the company estimates revenue will increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 60% from 2021 through 2026.Last year, EV sales accounted for 2.6% of global auto sales and just 1% of global auto stock, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Those are small percentages, but the numbers also imply ample room for growth and the need for more charging ports.“As technological progress in the electrification of two/three-wheelers, buses, and trucks advances and the market for them grows, electric vehicles are expanding significantly,” the IEA said.Data confirm that accessible chargers growth is stout, indicating that the speculative nature of many SPACs isn’t a primary concern with SBE stock.“Globally, the number of publicly accessible chargers (slow and fast) increased by 60% in 2019 compared with the previous year, higher than the electric light-duty vehicle stock growth,” notes the IEA.Bottom line: the automobile and fossil fuels industries are being disrupted and with that disruption comes compelling opportunity for investors. Chargepoint is one such opportunity and its importance in the EV ecosystem could prove alluring over the long term. It’s a growth name to be sure, but in this arena, Chargepoint is a staple, not discretionary, removing vulnerabilities auto sales and economic data.On the date of publication, Todd Shriber did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.Todd Shriber has been an InvestorPlace contributor since 2014.The post Switchback Energy Is an EV SPAC That’s Actually Worth a Look appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/switchback-energy-is-an-ev-spac-thats-actually-worth-a-look-2020-10-23

113,"Oct 23, 2020 10:49AM EDT","Maybe you recall the headlines several years ago detailing how Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) just couldn't seem to become consistently profitable. Free cash flow eluded the company due to the capital-intensive nature of the car-making business. Manufacturing is hard, the critics said. Excitement around the launch of the Model 3 gave way to what CEO Elon Musk called ""production hell.""Those days are over.From third-quarter revenue of $8.8 billion, Tesla generated $1.4 billion of free cash flow. In addition, it has been profitable on a GAAP basis for five quarters in a row now.Here's a closer look at the electric-car maker's latest quarterly results -- and why the company's ability to generate substantial profits is great news for shareholders.Tesla's Fremont, California factory. Image source: The Motley Fool.Fueled primarily by a 44% year-over-year increase in vehicle deliveries, total revenue rose by 39% in Q3. And though it was a relatively small piece of Tesla's financial pie, revenue from its energy generation and storage business jumped notably from $402 million in the year-ago period to $579 million.Thanks to a $5 billion capital raise during the period and substantial free cash flow generation, Tesla ended last quarter with total cash of $14.5 billion -- $5.9 billion more than it had on the books at the close of Q2.Meanwhile, Tesla says it's within striking distance of achieving 500,000 deliveries in 2020. This would be a big jump from the approximately 368,000 cars the company delivered in 2019. It's particularly impressive to see the automaker continuing to aim for its original delivery target for the year even after it had to temporarily shut down its factories due to the coronavirus pandemic.Tesla's sudden financial strength during a tumultuous year for the economy has set the automaker up well to capitalize on the growth opportunity in front of it.Image source: Tesla.It's now in a position to finance its product roadmap and long-term production capacity expansion with internally generated funds. This means the company is no longer dependent on the equity and debt markets to fund its growth.While Tesla did execute a timely capital raise during Q3 when its shares were trading at near $450, the automaker's underlying business is demonstrating an ability to throw off enough cash for both regular operations and aggressive investments in growth opportunities.""Over the past four quarters, we generated over $1.9B of free cash flow while spending $2.4B on new production capacity, service centers, Supercharging locations and other capital investments,"" Tesla said in its third-quarter update.There are always the risks that its competitors will prove more capable than anticipated or that Tesla will run into major unexpected challenges.

114,"Oct 23, 2020 9:44AM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe market chop continues, although equities were pushing nicely higher on Thursday. Can the market build on its recent momentum? Let’s look at the charts of our top stock trades for Friday. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares were slightly higher on Thursday after reporting earnings on Wednesday after the close. The real losers on the day? Those who paid premiums for calls or puts looking for a big reaction. The winners? Premium sellers. In any regard, the charts remain intact. The stock is maintaining above the 50-day moving average, which has been support since September, the first time Tesla had tested the 50-day in months. If this level holds, investors will be looking for a breakout over $460. Above this month’s high at $465.90 and shares may make a run at the highs near $500. If support gives way, the October low is on the table near $406. A close below $400 could put the $350 to $370 zone in play, along with the 100-day moving average. After so much disappointment in AT&T (NYSE:T), investors are breathing a shallow sigh of relief. That’s as the stock rallied about 6% on earnings. However, it’s a shallow breath because this stock isn’t out of the woods yet. The $27 level continues to hold as support, but what investors really need to see is the stock break out over the 10-week moving average. As long as it remains below this mark, it will have trouble rallying. Above the 10-week could put $30 and the 200-week moving average in play. Below the 10-week moving average and $27 remains on the table. Below $27 and this week’s low at $26.54 is vulnerable. If that level fails to hold as support, $25 could be back in the realm of possibilities. Like Tesla, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) was only slightly higher on Thursday despite reporting earnings.Also like Tesla, Coca-Cola is trying to breakout over resistance as it rides the 50-day moving average higher. Who would have thought that KO and TSLA stocks had so much in common, at least, technically speaking. A close over $51.50 — and preferably $52 for good measure — would be enough to kickstart the move higher. It could put $55 in play and potentially higher if bulls really regain momentum. If KO stock can’t break out, the 50-day moving average is support. A close below this mark puts the $48 area on watch. A close below $48 and its major moving averages does not bode well for longs. I want little to do with Coca-Cola stock if it breaks this many support marks. Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) reported pretty solid earnings results, although I don’t think bulls are going to panic about a 1.5% drop after such a stellar run. In fact, this is a very nice-looking little bull flag (blue lines) down to the 20-day moving average. The decline also filled the gap left from earlier this month. By most accounts, this is pretty healthy price action. What I want to see now is a move back over the 10-day moving average (not shown on the chart above, but currently at $362). If we get it, odds are favorable for a long setup. It would put $380 in play on the upside, followed by a possible breakout toward $400. On the downside, a close below the 20-day moving average and Thursday’s low would be the risk point. On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell held a long position in T.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.The post 4 Top Stock Trades for Friday: TSLA, T, KO, LRCX appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-top-stock-trades-for-friday%3A-tsla-t-ko-lrcx-2020-10-23

115,"Oct 23, 2020 8:40AM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe driverless vehicle technology race is over. Congratulations Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) investors. Alphabet stock was the right bet. For years, auto and technology investors have been anticipating which company would be the first to have a fully autonomous vehicle service available to the public. Earlier this month, that question was answered. On Oct. 8, Alphabet subsidiary Waymo announced its fully driverless rides will be available to the public in the Phoenix area. Within days, General Motors (NYSE:GM) announced its Cruise driverless vehicles will begin testing without drivers in San Francisco before the end of the year. Cruise and Waymo have been the frontrunners in the AV technology race for a long time. Now that AV has gone from being a buzzword to an actual thing, the AV tech race is over. A new race has now begun. Which of the two companies can get the first mover advantage in a massive global AV service market?Alphabet subsidiary Waymo has been testing its AV technology in the Phoenix area since 2018. But for the first time ever, Phoenix users who call a car using the Waymo One app can now get a car without a human safety driver behind the wheel. The service is pretty surreal to see in action. Alphabet stock investors can check it out in the video here.The fully driverless service is only available in an area about 50 square miles in size to start. Waymo said it plans to expand the offering to the entire Phoenix public in the weeks ahead. Waymo said 5% to 10% of its rides so far in 2020 have been fully driverless and have involved users who signed non-disclosure agreements to participate.It’s best not to get bogged down in the details. The year is 2020, and the American public can climb into a Waymo vehicle and be taken across town to their destination without a driver. That is a great reason to own Alphabet stock.When I bought Alphabet stock for myself back in March, I mentioned Waymo as one of the big reasons why. At the time, Navigant Research had named Waymo as the market leader in AV technology. As it turns out, they were right. Navigant also named GM Cruise as a close second in the AV race. As it turns out, they were right again. On Oct. 15, GM announced its Cruise AV subsidiary has gained approval from California regulators to remove human safety drivers completely and begin testing completely unmanned AVs in San Francisco by the end of 2020. Waymo had previously been granted a similar permit.GM seems to clearly be lagging Waymo in rolling out its AV service to the public. In its commentary related to the AV headlines, GM understandably emphasized the fact that Cruise will be the first company to test unmanned vehicles “on the streets of a major US city.”The next leg of the race will likely be a close one between GM and Waymo to see which robotaxi service ultimately becomes the gold standard in major cities throughout the country.I try to be a rational Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) skeptic. Navigant says Tesla is miles behind Waymo and GM. While YouTube users are watching the fully AV Waymo ride video, they can also check out Consumer Reports’ review of Tesla’s Autopilot feature. “We had some significant concerns with the newer features of the full self-driving package,” Consumer Reports said.Autopilot has some major flaws. From struggling to navigate a parking lot to stopping at green lights to straight up running stop signs, the Consumer Reports video on Tesla Autopilot is pretty scary.Yet Tesla is forging ahead. CEO Elon Musk said the company launched a Full Self-Driving beta test this month to “expert & careful drivers.” Of course, Tesla has been telling its customers they are getting Full Self-Driving hardware since 2016. But long-term Tesla investors know all too well at this point to disregard most of what Musk says. Not only is Tesla’s full self-driving software not actually full self-driving, it seems Tesla is leaving drivers to figure out what self driving can and can’t do. Waymo, GM and all other AV companies have conducted carefully controlled pilot tests before rolling out their software to the public. But not Tesla. AV technology is a major investing opportunity. I think Alphabet stock is a great investment with a number of major long-term growth catalysts ahead. I believe GM is an AV growth stock disguised as a value stock due to its 7.2 forward earnings multiple. And as I’ve said many times before, I believe Tesla’s valuation is ridiculously high due to the stock being caught in an electric vehicle bubble. If you want to invest in driverless vehicles, Alphabet stock is the best choice. It is officially the first major company to launch a fully self-driving service to the public. GM stock is a good second bet given its extremely attractive valuation and regulator-approved AV technology.On the date of publication, Wayne Duggan held long positions in GOOGL and GM.Wayne Duggan has been a U.S. News & World Report Investing contributor since 2016 and is a staff writer at Benzinga, where he has written more than 7,000 articles.

116,"Oct 23, 2020 7:40AM EDT","This stock more than tripled in its first day of trading as a public company and peaked a day later at more than five times its initial public offering price. That may sound like a story from the dot-com bubble, when we were all terrified that our computers would fail to recognize the new millennium as the calendar turned 1999 into 2000. But actually, this rocket-ship stock came public recently: CureVac (NASDAQ: CVAC) made its debut in August.The German biotechnology company is using messenger RNA (mRNA) -- which can be described as the instructions cells use to translate DNA into action -- to develop a vaccine for COVID-19. The company has some heavyweight backing, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the founder of software maker SAP (NYSE: SAP), the German government, and  GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK). Not enough celebrity for you? The company also has a manufacturing agreement with Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) to build molecule printers in Germany. More about that in a bit.Image source: Getty Images.The mRNA approach is proving popular as a way to tackle the novel coronavirus. There are currently six mRNA vaccines in human trials around the world, including the headline-grabbing Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA) candidate. Despite a crowded field, CureVac has reason to be hopeful. In January, the company demonstrated its capability with positive results in early clinical trials for a rabies vaccine. Management leveraged this success into a candidate aimed at preventing COVID-19. Although CureVac's current candidate needs to be frozen, management is aiming for one that can be stored closer to room temperature, at 36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit.A year before the pandemic, the company announced a partnership with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI) to develop an RNA printer. This technology would not only be able to produce vast quantities of vaccine fast, it would do so at significantly less cost, and it could be used in a pharmacy setting or in regions with severe outbreaks. The company is named with Tesla on a patent to create a bioreactor which would create the needed RNA vaccine without the currently required amount of staff and manual handling.Management received approval to begin phase 1 trials on June 17, and that phase 1 study is currently ongoing in Germany and Belgium. CureVac also has a phase 2a clinical trial going that includes 690 healthy adults aged 18 to 60 in Peru and Panama. Each will be given a prime shot, and then a booster after 28 days. The trial is designed to select a dose level and measure the immune response. Management plans to launch a phase 2b/3 study of 30,000 volunteers globally in late November.It's notable that CureVac is a German company. That country has outperformed its European neighbors in fighting the coronavirus pandemic to date, led by its scientist-in-chief, Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has a doctorate in quantum chemistry and has proven her scientific chops during this pandemic. In sharing complex scientific ideas in an easy-to-understand way, German authorities were transparent about what they didn't know, building trust with the population. Merkel provided updates to the public, based on data, and deferred to experts when possible. Most notably, the country rapidly rolled out testing -- even developing the test that the World Health Organization would ultimately adopt -- and released contact tracing apps for citizens to notify others if they tested positive. In fact, the country's response to the pandemic has been so good, it is often called the ""German anomaly.""In March, a German newspaper reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered the company $1 billion for exclusive rights to the vaccine. Although the report was disputed, Germany's minister of the economy said the company would get all the help it needed. This turned out to be true, as the German government moved quickly to take a 23% stake in the vaccine maker for $337 million. Although the company's CEO exuded confidence after the March meeting in the White House -- offering a vaccine timeline of a few months -- he was ousted just a few weeks later in favor of one of the company's founders. Perhaps that aggressive commitment had something to do with the decision.Although no vaccine using mRNA technology has ever been proven safe and effective and subsequently licensed for human use, CureVac is taking a careful approach that could pay off in the end. Trials have screened out anyone with a possible complicating factor, like smoking, and they require 14 participant check-ins over the course of a year to ensure data quality and clear results. In a recent interview, the company's head of vaccine development, Dr. Lidia Oostvogels, admitted the pressure is high but sounded upbeat: ""So far, so good. I'm excited and eager to go ahead."" The most updated timeline has the vaccine available by mid-2021. With trials of other candidates facing delays due to enrollment issues and adverse events, it may be this company's emulation of Merkel's methodical, detailed approach to the virus that leads to the first approved mRNA vaccine.10 stocks we like better than CureVacWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

117,"Oct 23, 2020 6:05AM EDT","While Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) third-quarter earnings report may be the primary focus when it comes to the electric-car maker's stock this week, the company also quietly rolled out a beta release of its full self-driving mode to a small group of drivers -- a technology that could eventually morph into an incredibly valuable asset for Tesla.Here's what we know about the beta release of Tesla's full self-driving mode, as well as a look at what it means for investors.Model 3. Image source: Tesla.Tesla started rolling out the beta version of its full self-driving mode to a limited group of owners on Tuesday night. The new feature was beamed to these vehicles via an over-the-air software update -- the same way Tesla regularly rolls out improvements to its vehicle fleet.""Will be extremely slow & cautious, as it should,"" Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Twitter. It's worth emphasizing that Tesla is making it very clear that this driving mode is still in beta. ""Full Self-Driving is in early limited access Beta and must be used with additional caution,"" Tesla warned in the release notes for the new feature. ""It may do the wrong thing at the worst time, so you must always keep your hands on the wheel and pay extra attention to the road. Do not become complacent."" Users in the limited group have started posting videos of the beta technology in action on social media, showing the Tesla navigate through roundabouts, stop and go at traffic lights, turn at traffic lights and stop signs, and more. In Tesla's third-quarter earnings call on Wednesday, Musk said Tesla plans to gradually release it to more drivers. And a wide release of the beta feature could come as early as the end of this year, he said.Tesla has said it plans to gradually increase the price of its ""full self-driving"" package, which allows customers to prepay for all the full self-driving features the company will roll out in the future. In July, Tesla increased the price of the software update from $7,000 to $8,000. And now, Tesla is going to increase the price of the feature by another $2,000 on Monday. Earlier this year, Musk said that the feature could eventually be worth ""somewhere in excess of $100,000."" Tesla plans to eventually launch an autonomous-driving network in which owners can deploy their vehicles. Customers will be able to earn a share of revenue from the network when their car is active in it. Because of this potential, Musk has said he believes Tesla vehicles could become appreciating assets.Tesla's beta for full self-driving is still notably very far from a fully autonomous vehicle. Further, there's no guarantee that Tesla's ""full self-driving"" software will ever be even close to as valuable as the company thinks it will. But it's certainly easy to imagine Tesla better monetizing the software as it improves. Indeed, there's been speculation that the company could even start selling the software as a subscription service.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

118,"Oct 23, 2020 5:53AM EDT","[10/22/2020] Tesla’s Margins Soar Over Q3Tesla published its Q3 2020 results Wednesday, reporting that Revenue rose 39% year-over-year to $8.8 billion, as deliveries grew 43% year-over-year to 139k vehicles. As expected, Tesla’s Operating margins expanded considerably, rising to 9.2% from 4.1% in Q3 2019 and 5.4% in Q2 2020. While part of the gains came from higher sales of Regulatory credits (up 196% year-over-year and down 7% sequentially) – which are almost pure profit, improved economies of scale from Tesla’s soaring deliveries are certainly helping to improve margins. Tesla said that Automotive Gross margins, excluding Regulatory Credit sales rose from 18.7% in Q2 2020 to about 23.7% in Q3. The margin improvements are encouraging, given that Tesla’s high valuation hinges on the company eventually posting industry-leading margins.[10/20/2020] Will Tesla’s Margins Expand In Q3?Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has become the world’s most valuable automaker by far with a market cap of over $400 billion, as its stock soared by about 5x this year. At current valuations, investors are counting on Tesla to continue robust delivery growth, while eventually posting industry-leading margins driven by higher software sales, improved economies of scale, and lower battery costs. Now, Tesla is mostly delivering on the growth front – deliveries soared by 43% year-over-year in Q3 2020. When the company publishes Q3 results this Wednesday, our focus will be on Tesla’s Operating Margins – which we expect will see considerable improvement, as Revenues continue to scale up with costs largely remaining under control. Below is a bit more on what to expect when the company reports earnings. See our analysis on Tesla Expenses: How Does Tesla Spend Its Money? for a detailed breakdown of Tesla’s costs. Tesla has already published delivery figures for Q3, indicating that deliveries soared by 43% year-over-year to about 139k units in Q3 2020, likely driven by higher sales of Model 3 in China as Tesla scales up production at its Shanghai factory and by sales of the Model Y compact SUV which was launched earlier this year. While Average Selling Prices of Tesla’s vehicles could trend lower year-over-year, due to price adjustments and a higher mix of lower-priced Model 3 and Y sales, Revenues are still likely to trend significantly higher.Now Tesla’s Gross Margins – defined as Revenues less direct costs – should benefit from higher software sales, as Tesla raised the price of its autopilot feature by $1,000 to $8,000 at the beginning of this quarter. Secondly, Tesla is likely to continue benefiting from stronger sales of emission credits. The company’s regulatory credit sales soared 4x in Q2 2020 likely driven by Tesla’s deal to sell about $2 billion in credits over 2020 and 2021 to Fiat Chrysler.Tesla has also been managing its fixed operating costs well. The company’s Selling, General & Administrative expenses have largely averaged about $650 million each quarter while R&D expenses have been trending lower.  With soaring Revenues, the above-mentioned tailwinds for Gross Margins, and solid operating cost controls, Tesla’s Operating Margins should trend higher in Q3. For perspective, Operating Margins expanded from about -3% in Q2 2019 to about 5% in Q2 2020 and we think it’s likely that the metric will see a strong increase this quarter.What if you’re looking for a more balanced portfolio instead? Here’s a high-quality portfolio to beat the market, with over 100% return since 2016, versus 55% for the S&P 500. Comprised of companies with strong revenue growth, healthy profits, lots of cash, and low risk, it has outperformed the broader market year after year, consistently.See all Trefis Price Estimates and Download Trefis Data hereWhat’s behind Trefis?

120,"Oct 22, 2020 7:01PM EDT","By Nick CareyLONDON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - British government plans that could allow self-driving cars on motorways as soon as 2021 would put lives at risk because the available automated technology falls well short of human driving capabilities, UK insurance group Thatcham Research said on Friday.""We don't believe that this technology adequately addresses what consumers will do and how they'll use it,"" said Thatcham's research director Matthew Avery.The UK government is due to close a consultation on Oct. 27 that could lead to some form of automated driving on British motorways. That could include the use of Automated Lane Keeping Systems (ALKS) that would allow drivers to take their hands off the wheel and let the vehicle drive itself.German manufacturers like Daimler AG DAIGn.DE and U.S. electric carmaker Tesla Inc TSLA.O have been at the forefront of developing sophisticated automated driving features that they insist can be used safely.But Thatcham Research, which is funded by insurers but operates independently, said current technology may not be able to see debris on the road, avoid pedestrians or recognise when a motorway lane is closed.""There are liability and legal challenges with ALKS, as well as safety challenges about your vehicle not being able to do what an engaged human driver can do,"" Avery said. ""The technology just isn't there yet, regardless of what the manufacturers say.""U.S. researchers have raised similar concerns. The problem for the insurance industry is that if a driver is not in charge of a vehicle, they would be classed as a passenger, which would create additional liability for insurers and could lead to higher premiums.Avery said that within around five years self-driving systems will be able to handle motorway driving, but calling today's systems ""automated"" is misleading for drivers as it should be ""assisted driving"". He referred to accidents drivers have had using Tesla's ""Autopilot"" system.""We've seen people doing stupid stuff with Teslas, getting in the back of the car when they feel it's automated when its clearly not,"" Avery said.(Reporting by Nick Carey; Editing by Susan Fenton)((nick.carey@thomsonreuters.com; +44 7385 414954;))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/uk-plans-for-self-driving-cars-threaten-safety-insurance-group-2020-10-22

121,"Oct 22, 2020 5:46PM EDT","As investors and advisors look to hone in on innovation, timely given Tesla's strong earnings (TSLA), there are ways to look at ETFs through this lens. ETF Trends CIO and Director of Research, Dave Nadig, spoke with Yahoo Finance’s Akiko Fujita on “The ETF Report,” on measuring said innovation's success and seeing it as an asset class.Nadig notes how one of the big challenges is how to define innovation as an asset class. The catalyst for this is a few different things. A notable one is the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), which has made a name for itself by going strong on big names such as Tesla. It's pulled in around $5.5 billion in assets this year and is up 134% over the last year. This has led to a whole spate of recent product launches with varying levels of investor interest.As Nadig explains, ""ARKK is notable because it's an openly actively managed fund. I think we can all get how you get these analysts to chase these exciting young companies that are being disruptive. But, how you take data and build an index around that has been tricky. Still, people are attempting to accomplish this.""Recent launches have added to this. They tend to look at specific industries that are right for transformation. For example, healthcare and telehealth, or online retailers make a lot of sense. At the same time, looking into areas like R&D development and patents can also prove to factor in the same way.Highlight: Innovation ETFs are “looking for specific corners of the economy that are in the midst of enormous change and disruption,” @ETFtrends CIO & Director of Research @DaveNadig says. “That’s why these companies are exciting, but… they can be very, very risky.” pic.twitter.com/9Xh7qwVT1R— Yahoo Finance (@YahooFinance) October 22, 2020When questioned about the nature of volatility's role when investing in these ETFs focusing around these sectors, Nadig explains it is very much a factor. These kinds of funds are looking for specific corners of the economy in the midst of enormous change and disruption.He continues, ""The reason we are focusing on it right now, obviously, is the many complex and relevant events that are making those changes happen even faster. This, in turn, creates what people have been calling the K-shaped recovery, where there's a batch of big winners and big losers. But, when you're going to participate in a part of the economy that's being blown up -- there's going to be good and bad days.

123,"Oct 22, 2020 4:14PM EDT","Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) posted its latest quarterly figures after market close on Wednesday, and the shares are trading up in response.For the company's third quarter of fiscal 2020, revenue rose by 39% on a year-over-year basis to $8.77 billion. On the bottom line, non-GAAP (adjusted) net profit doubled and then some, to $874 million ($0.76 per share) from the year-ago result of $342 million.Image source: Tesla.Both figures came in well above analyst estimates. On average, prognosticators were modeling a far lower per-share adjusted net profit of $0.56, and they believed Tesla would only book $8.26 billion in revenue.The company's results were helped to no small degree by growth in vehicle deliveries that was well in the double digits. The company shipped 15,275 units of its premium Model S sedan and Model X SUV; that number was 44% higher year over year. Even better, deliveries of the comparatively inexpensive Model 3 sedan and Model Y SUV increased 55% to 124,318.During the quarter, production in both categories also rose -- dramatically, in the case of Model S/X. In Q3 the company manufactured 16,992 of these models, 169% higher than in the same period of 2019. As for Model 3/Y, that increase was 69% (to 128,044).While the company's battery segment remains small in relation to vehicles, it is also growing.

Why the sudden jump?Image source: Getty Images.Lacking any more obvious catalysts, my best guess at this point is that 3D stock is reacting positively to earnings news out of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), which last night reported both impressive free cash flow and also strong sales growth of 39% year over year.Tesla, as you may have heard, was recently spotted hiring technician(s) to operate its 3D printing equipment, and confiding that this aspect of its manufacturing operations is ""rapidly growing.""Now, this doesn't necessarily mean that Tesla is doing more business with 3D printer-maker 3D Systems, in particular. Today's share price spike at 3D Systems could be entirely an overreaction -- or a reaction to some other news (of which I'm unaware) that's ongoing.But it's recently been brought to my attention (thanks, dear reader!) that at least one of Tesla's R&D prototyping managers is a former SLS applications engineer at 3D Systems, which may suggest an affinity for that company's products within Tesla.  As far as supporting a buy thesis goes, this one is a rather thin straw -- and I'm not at all convinced it suffices to justify a near-14% spike in 3D Systems' share price today.

126,"Oct 22, 2020 3:45PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt’s confession time. Personally, my gamble on Spartan Energy Acquisition (NYSE:SPAQ), a special purpose acquisition company that is on schedule to become Fisker Inc. was my FOMO play. That’s an acronym for fear of missing out. Now, I’m beginning to think that maybe I should have missed out on SPAQ stock. Let’s back up for a moment. When the novel coronavirus first breached our shores, I had a sinking feeling in my stomach. Even when Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, assured the American people that the government had the coronavirus “pretty close to airtight,” I was skeptical. Sure enough, the markets soon collapsed, hurdling us toward the new normal.About the only sectors that I felt good about were precious metals and gun stocks, and purely for cynical reasons. I found it absurd that any consumer discretionary retail name would soar, let alone something as expensive as cars. After all, with the shutdowns, what was the point of driving for non-essential workers?Nevertheless, I was proven wrong. Companies like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) soared to the moon, presumably in part because the coronavirus badly exposed global supply chain vulnerabilities of the traditional combustion vehicle market. As well, other electric vehicle manufacturers saw their equity shares rise. Thus, it seemed perfectly normal under the new normal that SPAQ stock would rise.But it wasn’t for following the EV crowd. Rather, I felt that Henrik Fisker, the brilliant mind behind his namesake organization would bring something to the table: distinguished design. Fisker designed some of the most iconic cars that automotive enthusiasts crave.As I argued, Fisker is an automotive company that incorporates the latest technologies to provide the mechanical catalyst, not the other way around. Further, I stated the simple truth about automotive marketing: it’s the exterior design that compels luxury auto consumers to consider buying the vehicle. The features are secondary to the initial impulse.To be clear, I still believe this. However, the coronavirus pandemic may finally be bringing some rationality into the broader economy. Unfortunately, that may impact the automotive economy, which isn’t great news for SPAQ stock.Beyond the gorgeous design of Fisker’s electric Ocean SUV, what drew me into SPAQ stock was the pricing. According to Cnet.com, the Ocean can be purchased for $37,499, which isn’t bad at all. Consider that the entry level Tesla Model 3 starts for around that price and that’s a sedan.With the Ocean, you get an SUV. As you can tell from your daily commute (before the pandemic), Americans just love their SUVs. And in the new normal, the desire to buy such a platform will likely increase due to its inherent utility.Plus, consumers have the option to lease the Ocean for only $379. In my opinion, that’s a bargain for what you’re getting. Unfortunately, that might not be enough to help Fisker, which is now staring at a potentially devastating turn for the worse in the automotive market.One of the shocking elements of the pandemic was that used car values didn’t plummet as anticipated. Instead, they skyrocketed. Why? With people eschewing public transportation in major metropolitan areas which don’t necessarily require a personal vehicle, many ended up buying their first car. Logically, used cars provided the most value.In addition, with consumers seeing used car prices rise, they probably figured they should jump in before the prices get too out of control. It became a self-fulfilling prophesy as the Manheim Used Vehicle Index shared an almost perfect direct correlation with dealership-based used car sales. But that’s a problem because these two metrics should generally be inversely correlated.As you know from basic economic principles, lowering the price results in greater demand volume, all other things being equal. But those principles didn’t apply in the new normal, at least not then. But now, it appears that rationality is creeping in.From government data, revenue for used car dealerships started to peak during the summer season. In response, it appears that dealerships have been marking down their vehicles, per the Manheim index. Collectively, this dynamic suggests that the consumer is becoming price sensitive.In that case, the main impetus for SPAQ stock — luxury SUVS at reasonable prices — will likely take a hit. And that’s not a risk to play down.Frankly, Fisker finds itself now in a tough spot. It isn’t Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), so it doesn’t have the ultra-luxury brand appeal. And while the Fisker brand appeals to automotive enthusiasts, the mass consumer base prefers Tesla, at least for now.But that doesn’t mean you should give up all hope. When you drill into the nuances of the Manheim index, you’ll see that pickups, luxury cars, and SUVs rank as the most popular choices for used cars, in that order. Well, Fisker addresses the latter two in one package, which isn’t a bad deal.Further, if it can reach production goals — and that’s not guarantee — the $379 lease deal is outstanding. Certainly, the looks are sharp and distinctive, true to Henrik Fisker’s brilliance. If it can hold on, there are reasons for optimism.However, I concede that multiple variables exist. Further, this is not an investment for the faint of heart. If you don’t mind the risk, you may want to check out SPAQ stock. For everyone else, you should probably observe from afar.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in SPAQ.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Even as other market benchmarks moved more aggressively upward, the Nasdaq was left with just a 0.3% gain at 2 p.m. EDT.Yet that doesn't mean there wasn't some extremely good news among Nasdaq-listed stocks. Align Technology (NASDAQ: ALGN) mounted an incredible move higher, as its latest quarterly financial report gave shareholders in the orthodontic alignment specialist something to smile about. Meanwhile, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) shares didn't manage to match Align's performance, but the stock still moved higher after the electric vehicle pioneer pointed to continuing favorable trends in its latest results.Prices of Align Technology's stock soared upward by more than $110 per share, or 34%, at midday Thursday. That was enough to push the share price of the maker of Invisalign orthodontic devices up to a new all-time record high.Image source: Getty Images.Align's third-quarter results were a big part of the reason. Revenue climbed 21% year over year, with the number of lifetime Invisalign customers reaching the 9 million mark during the period. Adjusted net income climbed even more sharply, rising 50%.A number of other favorable factors helped Align. Gross margin jumped 10 full percentage points from levels three months ago, and sales volumes of its clear aligners were up 29% to approach the 500,000 mark. In particular, Align was successful in getting more teens to choose its products, with case volumes rising 26% year over year in a key growth area for the company.Separately, Align also announced its latest innovation. The Invisalign G8 now has SmartForce Aligner Activation features that incorporate more of the company's proprietary biomechanics knowledge into the product.CEO Joe Hogan pointed to the work-from-home movement as a key factor in its growth, saying that those using videoconferencing have more time to look at their faces on-screen and consider whether they'd like orthodontic treatment. Regardless of the exact reasons, Align made just about everyone smile with its results.Elsewhere, Tesla saw a more modest move higher, with its stock rising more than 2%. The vehicle maker reported solid results in its third quarter and said it anticipates being able to meet its key delivery target for the full year.Investors had already known going into Wednesday afternoon's report that the company had delivered 139,300 vehicles and produced more than 145,000. But missing from the early October vehicle-oriented report were revenue and profit figures.Tesla's third-quarter revenue came in at $8.77 billion, up 39% from year-earlier levels. Automotive revenue jumped 42% to $7.61 billion. Adjusted net income of $874 million was higher by 156% compared to the year-earlier quarter, working out to $0.76 per share.Moreover, Tesla's balance-sheet strength improved. Free cash flow rose to nearly $1.4 billion for the quarter, and the company boasts more than $14.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents available for internal investment.Naysayers will point to the fact that the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income of $331 million was less than the $397 million that Tesla got from sales of regulatory credits. That's been a recurring theme, and it partially explains why the automaker hasn't yet gotten invited to be part of the S&P 500 Index despite being profitable for five quarters in a row now.Nevertheless, Tesla continued to make progress both with vehicle production and other initiatives. That's good news for investors in the automaker stock regardless of what the share price does in the near term.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

128,"Oct 22, 2020 2:52PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt’s been a couple of weeks since Sunrun (NASDAQ:RUN) completed its all-stock purchase of Vivint Solar for $1.46 billion and the assumption of approximately $1.7 billion in debt. Owners of RUN stock will own 64% of the combined company, while Vivint shareholders will own the rest.Data from BloombergNEF, which specializes in the energy industry, suggests that Americans will install 3 gigawatts (GW) of solar panels on their roofs in 2020 and an estimated 3.6 GW in 2021. Both annual records.  “The push for renewables is really strong,” said Tara Narayanan, an analyst quoted in the Bloomberg Green piece. “It’s allowed the sector to shake off the worst of the plague and some natural disasters.”When reading numbers like the ones above, the natural inclination is to assume this is good news for installers such as Sunrun. More GW’s means more revenue for the company, etc. That’s the theory. But in reality, that’s not always the case. RUN stock could benefit from America’s love affair with solar. It could also fall flat on its face. Here’s a look at both sides of the story. There are two ways to look at this consolidation move in the residential solar market in this country. The first is that the Sunrun/Vivint deal brings together two unprofitable businesses. While the combined entity will be bigger, there’s a good possibility that it won’t be better or even profitable.  Solar power marketing research expert Paula Mints discussed the combination in September as part of her monthly newsletter, the Solar Flare. She wasn’t very enthusiastic about the deal. “The residential solar lease and residential PPA offers little synergy for customers, other than giving away their ITC [investment tax credit] and paying much more over time for having a solar system on their roof than they would if they bought it in the first place,” Mints wrote. “Companies operating in the space need the cheapest cost of hardware (not always the best), fastest installs (not always the best), to reuse equipment when customers withdraw (including inverters), and to keep on adding customers to feed the machine.”Mints reminded her readers about the 2016 Solar City acquisition by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) that was supposed to deliver all kinds of good things for Tesla shareholders. As it turned out, that didn’t happen. The second way to look at the combination is that scale is the only way to get to profitability in the solar energy journey. Together, Sunrun will have a 17.5% market share, about four times Tesla’s market share. “We have big ambitions for what we can accomplish together,” Sunrun CEO Lynn Jurich said in July when the merger was first announced. “We are only scratching the surface of our opportunity; today only 3 percent of [U.S.] households have made the transition to home solar.”“At a larger scale, with more customers and a lower cost structure, Sunrun will be a meaningful contributor to a fully renewable and electrified energy system,”While it’s a nice thought to think Americans will do the smart thing from a financial perspective and buy the solar panels rather than lease them, for most people, the lease option remains a more realistic option, I would think. The fact is, Sunrun’s biggest challenge is the cost of acquiring customers. It’s very high. “Sunrun has said that they are looking to Vivint’s direct sales channel to help support their growth, but most active national players have been moving away from door-to-door sales, in part because it is the most cost-intensive customer-acquisition channel,” said Wood Mackenzie senior solar analyst Austin Perea in July. Oh, and it doesn’t hurt that the combination should produce $90 million in annual cost synergies within 18 months. Earlier in October, I recommended Sunrun as one of 10 small-cap stocks to buy from some of America’s best ETFs. My recommendation didn’t consider Mints’ argument that customers end up paying more over the long haul by leasing than buying. Billionaire John Paul Getty used to say, “If it appreciates, buy it. If it depreciates, lease it.”Well, as far as I can tell, solar panels depreciate. Maybe not to the extent of a car or truck, but they certainly lose their value over time. “As the company says in its August 2020 presentation, it’s installing a new solar-powered energy system every two minutes. Founded in 2007, the need for solar power and the storage systems that come with them has accelerated in recent years as power outages have become more commonplace,” I wrote on Oct. 7. “Sure, over the life of a solar-powered system, you might save a few thousand, but for me, the real attraction is the clean energy created by those systems.”Am I crazy to think that 97% of American households that don’t have solar power would install panels on their roofs merely because of the clean energy and not the cost savings over the long haul?Probably. Will the Vivint deal deliver a pathway to profitability? We will find out. Until Sunrun gives me a reason to doubt it, RUN remains on my long-term buy list. On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. Will Ashworth has written about investments full-time since 2008.

129,"Oct 22, 2020 2:26PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsPiedmont Lithium (NASDAQ:PLL) stock has leapt onto the scene. The company is based out of Australia. However, it recently listed its shares on the Nasdaq as well, and Piedmont Lithium stock shot up as much as 500% in recent weeks. This came as it disclosed a crucial agreement to supply lithium to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).However, shares are starting to cool back down. And now, Piedmont looks set to come under further pressure. The company recently announced that it will be issuing 1.5 million shares of stock.While traders might rush to buy the subsequent dip, keep these points in mind before making any moves.The first thing a prospective investor should realize is that Piedmont Lithium has no ongoing business as of yet. In fact, historically, Piedmont Lithium has never produced any revenues from lithium sales.At this point, people are putting money into Piedmont Lithium in hopes that it will develop a lithium business in the future. To that end, Piedmont has a promising development site in North Carolina. North Carolina is a favorable jurisdiction for mineral operations from a tax perspective, and has seen other lithium mining ventures in the past.However, none of that guarantees that Piedmont Lithium will have ultimately have similar success.For Piedmont specifically, according to its latest pre-feasibility study for the key chemical plant, it intends to spend $377 million. All-in costs would be somewhat higher once you consider land acquisition and other necessary capital expenditures. The company anticipates the investment turning into $7.3 billion of revenues, $3.6 billion of EBITDA, and $2.4 billion of free cash flow.Piedmont plans on recovering its initial invested funds in three-and-a-half years, and says that at an 8% discount rate, the project’s present value is $714 million.These figures are all fine and well (though conservatively, mining projects often use a 10% discount rate instead of 8%). Even so, this isn’t compelling math given that Piedmont’s market capitalization is already nearly half a billion dollars. For all the risk of funding, building, and operating the plant, the net present value is only moderately higher than the current valuation.On top of that, the market for lithium is much less developed than gold, silver, or other such mine products, and thus there is more uncertainty over what the economics will look like once this operation is actually in production.Up until Tesla came along, there was no sign that Piedmont Lithium would be able to raise the half billion or so dollars needed to build this project. With Tesla’s name attached to the project, however, I expect that they’ll have a much easier time funding the project.Still, they’re likely to either offer high-yield bonds or a ton of stock to raise the needed capital. Piedmont’s current market capitalization is around $400 million. Needless to say, it’s hard to raise more capital than your current market cap via stock offerings without collapsing the price of your shares.We’ll see how shares hold up the wake of this in-process share offering, but don’t be surprised if it puts quite an overhang on PLL’s stock price in coming weeks.And the market for loans to lithium miners with no existing revenues is likely to be a demanding one. With Tesla on board, Piedmont Lithium will get investors’ attention. But it will still be a challenge to come up with funding for this massive project.Tesla is a wonderful partner as far as publicity goes. If you want a ton of free media attention, you can’t do any better than reaching a deal with Tesla. As the reaction in Piedmont Lithium stock recently has shown, Elon Musk brings a level of enthusiasm that you wouldn’t get signing a similar supply contract with, for example, Toyota (NYSE:TM).However, Tesla and Elon Musk have a known history of missing deadlines. In fact, on a recent conference call, Musk stated, “Punctuality is not my strong suit, but I always come through in the end.”Sometimes Tesla completes things ahead of schedule, such as the Shanghai Gigafactory. But on many occasions, there are delays before Tesla ends up making something happen.With Piedmont Lithium, where you aren’t likely to have commercial production until at least 2023 anyway. And if Tesla’s priorities end up elsewhere in the interim, Piedmont could sag for an extended period until operations really get rolling.Traders have aggressively bid up Piedmont Lithium stock since Tesla announced its intentions to buy lithium. I get the excitement. However, the current share price is simply too much too quickly for the nature of this project.Piedmont has a ton of work to do to get funding for and then build this project. And once it’s up and running, we’ll still have to see if the economics are actually robust or not. With production still years away, there’s plenty of time to wait for dips before taking a position.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Ian Bezek has written more than 1,000 articles for InvestorPlace.com and Seeking Alpha.

130,"Oct 22, 2020 2:25PM EDT","By Gertrude Chavez-DreyfussNEW YORK, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Shares on Wall Street gained on Thursday in choppy trading, as investors cheered the prospect of more fiscal stimulus to support a pandemic-damaged U.S. economy, with more data pointing to a slowing labor market recovery.Trading on Wall Street this week has been dictated by a flurry of reports related to progress in the stimulus talks. The CBOE Market Volatility index .VIX rose for the eighth time in nine sessions, and was last up 2.8%.U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reported progress in talks with the Trump administration for another round of financial aid and said legislation could be hammered out ""pretty soon"". ""The market remains highly sensitive to a fiscal stimulus deal,"" said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. ""What we're concerned about is the labor market as we move to the next couple of months. We get the roll-off of the stimulus and the labor market remains suspect. That's why we're looking for fiscal stimulus and the market is looking for fiscal stimulus,"" he added.Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have been negotiating a relief bill near the $2 trillion mark, a sum opposed by Senate Republicans who have expressed concern about the federal deficit.Also on Thursday, data showed the number of Americans filing for state unemployment benefits last week dropped more than expected to 787,000, but remained stubbornly high as support from fiscal stimulus faded.

132,"Oct 22, 2020 1:45PM EDT","As California goes, will the United States follow?In September, nearly a month ago, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed an executive order banning the sale of new gas- and diesel-powered automobiles within the state beginning in 2035. And now, two Democratic lawmakers, Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Rep. Mike Levin of California, have separately introduced the Zero-Emission Vehicles Act of 2020 in the U.S. Senate and House.  Image source: Getty Images.As with Gov. Newsom's order, the legislation in question would ban only the sale (not the possession, driving of, or resale) of cars powered by internal combustion engines by 2035. Technically, the law would begin with a requirement that by 2025, 50 percent of sales for new passenger vehicles are zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) powered either by batteries, fuel cells, or some other non-carbon-burning process.Each year thereafter, the sales requirement would increase by 5 percentage points until it tops out 10 years later, in 2035, with a requirement that 100% of new vehicles sold be ZEVs.As with the California executive order, the U.S. bill would also appear to capture, and eventually ban, the sale of hybrid-electric vehicles such as Toyota Motor's (NYSE: TM) popular Prius in favor of pure-play electric cars such as Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) lineup of vehicles.It should be emphasized that the proposed law is just a bill at this stage, and may never be enacted. Still, it has some support, including four co-sponsor signatures from high-profile senators such as former presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Cory Booker, and 15 co-sponsors in the House.10 stocks we like better than WalmartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

133,"Oct 22, 2020 1:25PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSunworks (NASDAQ:SUNW) stock is one of the most unpredictable ones on the Nasdaq lately. Shares have traded between 30 cents and $8 in recent months. There are mergers, lawsuits, potential business strategy shifts, and an election angle, among other developments. For a trader, SUNW stock has it all.With shares now around $3, still up 10x off the lows but down two-thirds from the recent high, is this a big dip-buying opportunity? Or should you head for the exits while the stock is still on the move? Here’s the pertinent information to consider.Sunworks is a small company. The company has a market capitalization of $51 million, earned revenues of $53 million over the past 12 months, and generated a modest loss in the course of doing that business. Despite those figures, Sunworks has big ambitions. It’s already a meaningful player in the residential solar installation space. Beyond that, it also has offerings for solar applications in industrial, agricultural, commercial, and public works uses as well.Given that SUNW stock had fallen from $20 five years ago to as little as 30 cents this year, however, the business strategy hadn’t been too successful. Thus, the company is now making some moves. For one, it agreed to merge with Peck Holdings (NASDAQ:PECK), another solar installer, earlier this summer.Things went crazy with SUNW stock last month, when shares shot up as much as 300% in one day. This appeared to be based on rumors that Sunworks and Peck might make a move into electric vehicles. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is splashing a ton of money on lithium, batteries, and other green technologies. This has caused shares of SPI Energy (NASDAQ:SPI) and other related names to surge. Traders have bet on a similar move out of Sunworks.Last month, our Sarah Smith rightly warned that SUNW stock traders should be: “Be incredibly cautious with this news. There is no press release or any formal announcement of its EV plans. Rumors alone — and a lot of hope — are driving the action in Sunworks.”Not much has changed in the interim. At this time, it’s still unclear whether Sunworks has anything firm in mind to cash in on the current enthusiasm for the space.The merger between Peck and Sunworks hasn’t closed yet. This adds to the drama around SUNW stock. Peck is offering 0.18 shares of its own stock for every share of SUNW stock. This implies that each Peck share should be trading for 5.4x the value of every SUNW share. Instead, however, the market is pricing Peck at about just 2.5x the value of Sunworks. This implies that the deal isn’t likely to close and/or that the price will have to be changed to satisfy shareholders.On that point, some shareholders are not happy with the proposed merger. Bloomberg Law reported that investor Gustavo Vieyra is leading a class action lawsuit. The suit says that Sunworks misrepresented its financial situation. Only by doing so did it create the opportunity for Peck to acquire Sunworks on the cheap. According to Vieyra’s explanation, Sunworks is potentially worth more as a standalone entity.This could go either way for SUNW stock owners. It’s good news to have an activist shareholder fighting for a better deal. On the other hand, if Vieyra’s interpretation of the situation is correct, it could indicate some governance problems with Sunworks as well. Ideally management shouldn’t need a lawsuit to motivate it to do the best for its shareholders.This is a messy situation on multiple fronts. And where there’s uncertainty, there’s plenty of trading opportunity. If you like to make day trades or short-term swings, SUNW stock could be an ideal vehicle. Heading into the election, at a minimum, there could be a powerful bid for solar stocks as the market looks forward to a potential Joe Biden victory.On the other hand, use solid risk management and keep a close eye on any potential trades. If the EV-related rumors don’t come to fruition or something goes wrong with the Peck merger, shares could move sharply lower. President Trump winning re-election would also dump a bucket of cold water on all the solar stocks, including Sunworks. Thus, if you want to trade SUNW stock, make sure to keep it on a tight leash.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Ian Bezek has written more than 1,000 articles for InvestorPlace.com and Seeking Alpha.

As of 11:30 a.m. EDT, however, the electric-car maker's stock was up about 3%.The growth stock's move higher was driven by stronger-than-expected results. Both Tesla's revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share for Q3 easily beat analysts' consensus forecasts.Image source: Getty Images.Tesla reported revenue of $8.8 billion, up 39% year over year. Analysts, on average, had been expecting revenue of $8.4 billion. That growth, of course, was fueled primarily by a 44% year-over-year increase in total vehicle deliveries.Non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share of $0.76 likewise handily beat analysts' average forecast of $0.57. Free cash flow for the quarter was particularly notable, coming in at $1.4 billion.Importantly, Tesla continues to push toward its goal of delivering 500,000 vehicles this year. Compared to its 368,000 deliveries in 2019, that would be impressive growth, especially considering that the company's factories were shut down temporarily due to pandemic-necessitated stay-at-home orders.""Achieving this target depends primarily on quarter over quarter increases in Model Y and Shanghai production,"" Tesla said in its third-quarter shareholder letter, ""as well as further improvements in logistics and delivery efficiency at higher volume levels.""10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Growth stocks generally have high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios and high price-to-book ratios. Still, data suggest the growth/value premium isn’t overly elevated relative to historical norms.Growth stocks may be seen as exorbitant and overvalued, causing some investors to favor value stocks, which are considered undervalued by the market. Value stocks tend to trade at a lower price relative to their fundamentals (including dividends, earnings, and sales). While they generally have solid fundamentals, value stocks may have lost popularity in the market and are considered bargain priced compared with their competitors.“In terms of sector allocation, information technology (36.31%) has the highest weighting, followed by consumer discretionaries (27.73%) and health care (11.68%).

140,"Oct 22, 2020 10:44AM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt’s often best to throw out your personal biases when you’re investing. This is particularly true when it comes to a stock like Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND). While I love to eat a 40-ounce steak from time to time and the idea of paying for fake meat alternatives doesn’t appeal much to me, I can no longer deny that the company holds significant long-term promise. The faux-meat maker has seen great success during the novel coronavirus pandemic, as meatless options are increasingly popular worldwide. In the past, many analysts have hit BYND stock over the head with a hammer, but it looks like it’s finally time to lighten up on it a bit.However, I’m not ready to join the bulls just yet. There are still plenty of reasons for caution looking at it through a longer-term scope. This is true for any stock backed by a hyperbolic growth narrative.BYND stock will likely rage on in the years ahead. It just might not soar as high as some analysts suggest. Here’s why.Many Beyond Meat bulls like to think of it as the “Tesla of food.” Like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), it’s a key player with a product behind several popular social movements (in this case, environmentalism and healthy eating). However, while Beyond certainly has game-changer potential, the hype might be a little too grand.One of my main issues with the hype narrative is the notion that faux meat will replace regular meat within the next 15 years (as claimed by Impossible Foods CEO Pat Brown). A faux meat “revolution” is upon us, depending on who you ask. But sometimes revolutionary ideas take much longer to develop before they become an actual world-changing movement.More people will undoubtedly add fake meat alternatives to their diet in the years to come. Plenty of people with balanced diets include a mixture of legumes, fish, dairy and animal meat for protein in their diets. There’s no reason to think they won’t continue adding faux meat into the mix more frequently in the years ahead. But the idea that most people will drop meat completely (and, by extension, Beyond Meat will reach some sort of godlike status among food companies) is severely flawed. At least over a 10-year span.There’s still reason for excitement, however.The products are gaining enormous popularity. Meanwhile, other concerns, like price, could become less significant in time. To some, “Beyond Meat is still a luxury.” That idea still stands today. Its current products are far more expensive than regular meat offerings — and vegetarian options as well. (You can make meatless burgers from a bag of lentils and a few other ingredients for much cheaper). But the company is working to make its products more affordable.Improved pricing should pick away at some bearish arguments over time. And if analysts like InvestorPlace.com’s Luke Lango are correct, Beyond Meat will enjoy first-mover advantage in this space as it becomes the household name behind the faux meat revolution. It seems like a win-win situation.But it’s still not that simple.Beyond Meat might not stay a “luxury” food item in time, but it will likely take much longer for it to replace meat entirely (if that’s even possible in our lifetime). Consider, for example, that of many of the world’s richest countries struggle to exceed 10% vegetarianism. While lofty ideas like a completely meatless world will undoubtedly gain strength in the years ahead, it’s doubtful that a massive amount of people will shift over to a diet that exclusively favors Beyond’s products. And that doesn’t even consider that the competition in the fake meat space is stronger than ever.For example, according to CBI Insights:“Beyond Meat’s chief competitor, Impossible Foods has also seen aggressive growth. The Redwood City-based company has aggregated more than $1.3B in total disclosed funding. Its products can be found at chains like Burger King, Qdoba, White Castle, and Red Robin.”BYND stock bulls would like you to believe that as a potential key leader in the faux meat movement, Beyond is guaranteed success as our society (and the world in general) shifts towards “green” initiatives. It’s true that this might be our future. (I hope it is). But the adoption of these practices over the next 10 years in the U.S. — and globally — is much less guaranteed thanks to the numerous political challenges associated with these movements.Likewise, bulls often tout millennial’s inclination towards ethical consumerism as a reason Beyond Meat will become the new standard. After all, products like Beyond Burgers make consumers feel good about their place in the world. However, when it comes to the world of food, it’s still not enough to eliminate many of their cravings for a real, artery-clogging burger.When it comes to food, taste is king. That’s something faux meat hasn’t yet been able to replicate or exceed convincingly. And although “Meatless Mondays” are becoming a thing, we’re still far away from widespread meatless diets. As such, there’s plenty of room for both faux meat and meat to coexist as part of the omnivore diet most people enjoy.That’s not necessarily a detriment to Beyond Meat’s prospects. But it’s also where things start to get a bit murky for Beyond Meat as the supposed king of a supposed meat-free future.While the roles might reverse, where faux meat is the standard and real meat is the luxury item, that whole process will likely take much longer than you think to unfold. Even so, it won’t guarantee that Beyond’s products are the go-to choice, as many of the stock’s long-term bulls would have you believe.The competition for Beyond Meat is tightening. Many argue that it’s already a household name, but I personally haven’t heard anyone mention it more than its competition when talking about faux meat. This lack of significant moat will make it difficult for the company to fortify its leadership position in the fake meat industry, as other players in the space grow stronger.So it all boils down to this:The adoption of faux meat is inevitable. Over the years, it may even replace meat as a primary source of protein in our diets. But the timeframe for that is debatable. Likewise, Beyond Meat has a strong position at the front of this movement. But again, its future as the king is also debatable.It has climbed 135% this year, leading to arguments that it’s currently overvalued. It seems like that’s the case, but I also agree with hardcore bulls like Lango that it has more room to run over the next 10 years. And, as he suggests, if you already have shares, it’s probably best to hold on to them for the long run.But unlike Luke, I’m skeptical that it will become the faux meat king. And I’m also skeptical that the faux meat revolution is actually upon us. With BYND stock, the long-term case comes down to this — where do you think we’ll be in the next 10 to 20 years?I think we’re probably headed toward a far more meatless future, only the timeframe is probably much longer than Beyond Meat bulls would have you believe.Also consider that there’s no clear reason to think another food company — upcomer or established — couldn’t devour much of Beyond’s strength in the years ahead. Ultimately, there are still plenty of reasons to keep questioning its valuation.On the date of publication, the author did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.The post Is Beyond Meat Stock a Long-Term Winner? appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-beyond-meat-stock-a-long-term-winner-2020-10-22

141,"Oct 22, 2020 10:42AM EDT","By Tina Bellon and David ShepardsonOct 22 (Reuters) - The U.S. auto safety regulator on Thursday said it was closely watching Tesla Inc's TSLA.O release of a software version intended to allow its cars to drive themselves, saying it stood ready to protect the public against safety risks.Tesla on Tuesday night released a beta, or test version, of what it calls a ""Full Self Driving"" software upgrade to an undisclosed number of ""expert, careful"" drivers. The release prompted online posts by excited recipients who shared video snippets of their car driving supposedly autonomously on city streets at night.During a Tesla earnings call on Wednesday, Chief Executive Elon Musk said the latest upgrade was planned to be widely released by the end of this year, with the system becoming more robust as it collected more data. ""NHTSA has been briefed on Tesla’s new feature, which represents an expansion of its existing driver assistance system. The agency will monitor the new technology closely and will not hesitate to take action to protect (the) public against unreasonable risks to safety,"" the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a statement.NHTSA in July said its special crash investigation team had ""looked into 19 crashes involving Tesla vehicles where it was believed some form of advanced driver assistance system was engaged at the time of the incident.""Musk for years has promised self-driving for the company's  vehicles but missed several self-imposed deadlines. Researchers, regulators and insurance groups say true self-driving is still years away and more complex than companies anticipated several years ago. They have criticized Tesla's promotion of its existing semi-automated Autopilot system as dangerously misleading. A consortium of self-driving technology companies, Partners for Automated Vehicle Education (PAVE), which includes Ford Motor Co F.N, General Motors GM.N and Google's GOOGL.O self-driving unit Waymo, criticized Tesla's approach.""Public road testing is a serious responsibility and using untrained consumers to validate beta-level software on public roads is dangerous and inconsistent with existing guidance and industry norms,"" PAVE said in a Thursday statement.Autopilot and similar advanced driver assistance systems can provide steering, braking and acceleration support under limited circumstances, generally on highways.Tesla's website describes the new software release as ""Autosteer on City Streets,"" saying the system requires active driver supervision and does not make the car autonomous. https://www.tesla.com/support/autopilotTesla owners can purchase ""Full Self Driving"" for $8,000 in hopes of eventually receiving the upgrade, with the price increasing by $2,000 on Monday, Musk said on Thursday.On Twitter, Tesla owners receiving the test version posted videos of their experience, claiming the car ""literally sees everything,"" setting indicators on its own and navigating turns even without clear lane markings. https://bit.ly/3kpgvUuThey also posted a picture of the software update release notes, which said the system ""may do the wrong thing at the worst time,"" urging drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and pay extra attention.Reuters could not reach Tesla for comment on NHTSA's statement and to confirm the authenticity of the release note.(Reporting by Tina Bellon in New York and David Shepardson in Washington; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Steve Orlofsky)((Tina.Bellon@thomsonreuters.com; +1 646 573 5029; Reuters Messaging: tina.bellon.thomsonreuters@reuters.net; Twitter @TinaBellon))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/teslas-release-of-new-self-driving-software-closely-watched-by-u.s.-regulator-2020-10-22

144,"Oct 22, 2020 10:00AM EDT","Stocks don't normally double in a year, and when they do, it's worth looking back and seeing what we can learn from any trends. This year, the market has had a strong year, but there has been a bifurcation of stocks that have done extremely well and others that have struggled. Looking at the stocks that have doubled over the past year, three tech stocks stuck out to me. Zoom (NASDAQ: ZM), Shopify (NYSE: SHOP), and Peloton (NASDAQ: PTON) are all emerging as powerhouses in their respective businesses, a big reason these growth stocks have all more than doubled in the past year.

The financial impact on Zoom's business has been downright astounding. You can see below that quarterly revenue has more than tripled in the last two quarters and doesn't seem like it's slowing down. ZM revenue (quarterly) data by YCharts.It's not clear that Zoom's business will continue to grow at this high rate, or at all, after the pandemic passes, but the company has ingrained itself with consumers and businesses around the world. That's a valuable position to be in, and makes this a stock to watch in 2021. Amazon is the biggest name in online shopping, but it's Shopify that's fueling the next generation of growth for e-commerce. The company makes the back-end infrastructure that powers over 1 million companies from Tesla to shoemaker Allbirds. As more shopping has been done online during the pandemic, it's no surprise that Shopify has been one of the biggest beneficiaries. It is signing up new businesses that are forming around the world and generating fees as people buy more things on its platform. While the pandemic has accelerated the market toward more online shopping, I think Shopify is uniquely positioned to benefit long term. The company is enabling small businesses to build brands, rather than squashing or controlling them, allowing innovation from others to drive growth. And it's slowly expanding its offerings into payments and advanced services for enterprise customers. As more companies want to build direct relationships with customers, Shopify is perfectly positioned to provide back-end services that allow these companies to grow. Image source: Peloton.The biggest challenge Peloton had in building a profitable business long term was building enough scale to make its subscription services the profit driver. A small base of bikes and treadmills could make for a nice niche business, but if millions of bikes and treadmills are in the market with active subscribers attached, this could be a massively profitable business because each additional customer's subscription is nearly all profit. A pandemic that has kept people home couldn't have come at a better time for any company. As of June 30, 2020, Peloton had 1.1 million subscribers doing an average of 24.7 workouts per month. That's an incredible usage rate for an at-home workout platform, and it shows how big the base is and how much consumers love the product. Peloton's stock is up 466% in the last year, but that may be just the start. The company has a great brand and huge lead in at-home workouts, which I don't think is going to be changing anytime soon. The theme with these three companies is that the pandemic has been a boost to their overall business. It didn't change what they did per se, but it accelerated consumer and business adoption at a faster rate. Companies that have done that over the last year have done well for investors, and Zoom, Shopify, and Peloton exemplify the trend. 10 stocks we like better than ShopifyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

148,"Oct 22, 2020 8:19AM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt seems like I haven’t written about Nio (NYSE:NIO) in eons. But in truth, it was just last month that I suggested Nio stock was on course to break through $20 in 2020.Despite the run it went on through the first eight-and-a-half months of 2020, I anticipated that its September swoon would impede its progress into the $20s, something my InvestorPlace colleagues were sure would come soon enough.It did. And then some. Since Sep. 16, Nio’s share price has increased by almost 50% through Oct. 19. Nio is the top-performing stock (market capitalization greater than $10 billion) on the New York Stock Exchange in 2020, up 587.3%, more than 225 percentage points clear of GSX Techedu (NYSE:GSX), the second-best performer.As for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), I argued in my September article that while a fan, I didn’t see TSLA stock catching Nio in 2020. With approximately 73 days left in the year, Tesla has a year to date return of 414.9%, 172 percentage points behind Nio. It’s not insurmountable but unlikely for Tesla to catch Nio.As for anyone who hasn’t bought Nio already, you’re probably wondering if it’s too late to make money off its stock.While I don’t believe you should ever make an investment based on the fear of missing out, I do think a three-to-five-year hold will still make you money. Here’s why.On Oct. 14, JPMorgan upgraded Nio to an “overweight” rating while raising its target price to $40 by June 2021. Based on a $27.50 share price, that’s 45% upside over a little more than eight months. I’ll take this kind of return all day long. At the same time, Citibank raised its rating to a “buy” while lifting its target price by 83% to $33.20.Of the 16 analysts covering Nio, they have a median 12-month price target of $135.47. I’d be more comfortable with this kind of estimate if 30 analysts were covering the stock. As it stands, the high estimate is $269.54, with a low estimate of $44.12.In August, only five analysts rated Nio a buy. Today, that’s up to nine analysts. Only two have a sell recommendation.I would say that the best bet would be to assume that the low estimate is the most realistic over the next 12 months. If accurate, it would still provide 60% upside. That wouldn’t be 2020 returns, but it’s unlikely that investors will catch lightning in a bottle a second time in 2021.I hope I’m wrong.Nio released its September and Q3 2020 delivery update in early October and the news was good.September was a record with 4,708 vehicles delivered — 3,210 ES6s, 1,482 ES8s, and 16 EC6s — up 133.2% over last year. In the third quarter, its deliveries increased 154.3% to 12,206, and through the first nine months of 2020, it delivered 26,375 vehicles, 113.7% higher than last year — the 2020 sales achievements despite being in a pandemic for several months.Of these statistics, however, it is the fact that it began delivering its sharp-looking EC6 coupe in late September that should encourage investors heading into 2021.This is an electric vehicle maker that seems to be hitting its stride. With a $37 billion market cap, its financing issues are very much in the rearview mirror.As recently as November 2019, I was extremely skeptical about its ability to stay afloat. Fortunately, the company’s Hail Mary pass was caught by three visionary investors (the Hefei municipal government was one of them) in late April, providing Nio with $1 billion in funding.That changed my tune. It’s been clear sailing ever since.The company expects to become profitable in the next 12 to 24 months once it doubles its current monthly sales. With three SUVs in the fold, it plans to bring out something different for its fourth vehicle launch.“We started with SUVs [the ES8 and ES6] because we leveraged the same platform and our third model [the EC6] that is launching now is a coupe-styled SUV. In China, the passenger vehicle market is basically 50-50 for sedans and SUVs, but with a much faster growth for SUVs,” Nio president Lihong Qin told Automotive News Europe contributor Nick Gibbs in June.“Under our plan we aim to launch a new product every year. We will start deliveries of a new product next year. I won’t say what it is, but it’s not going to be an SUV.”So, for the remainder of 2020, Nio will continue to push its three-vehicle lineup. Next year it will probably add a sedan or perhaps a sporty coupe. Whatever it does, Europe will play heavily in its expansion outside China.Nio currently trades at 25 times sales. If you assume that Nio doubles sales in 2021, and the multiple is maintained, there is justification for its stock price doubling over the next year.However, if you feel that its price-to-sales multiple should be closer to Tesla’s at 16 then it’s unlikely that NIO stock will double in 2021.Nio delivered 20,565 vehicles in 2019. Through the first nine months of 2020, it’s up to 26,375. The fourth quarter of 2019 saw Nio deliver 8.224 vehicles. Assuming a conservative increase of 20% for Q4 2020, it will deliver 36,243 vehicles in 2020.While I believe the actual number will be well over 40,000, if you double its 2020 deliveries based on my estimate, it suggests 72,488 vehicle deliveries in 2021.In Q2 2020, it had average revenue per vehicle of $47,759 based on 10,331 vehicle deliveries and $493.4 million in vehicle sales. Extrapolate that over 72,488 vehicles, and you get a market cap of $71 billion based on 2021 sales of $3.46 billion and a P/S multiple halfway between Nio’s current multiple and Tesla’s.Unless something unforeseen happens, I believe there is still plenty of room on the Nio bandwagon.Long-term, Nio stock remains a definite buy.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. Will Ashworth has written about investments full-time since 2008.

149,"Oct 22, 2020 8:05AM EDT","Today’s Big PictureThe markets today are focused on growth risks and stimulus. New coronavirus cases continue to accelerate, and economic restrictions are increasing and/or tightening in many nations. After making progress in negotiations yesterday, House Speaker Pelosi said she was feeling optimistic and still wanted an agreement before the election. Negotiations are set to continue today without a clear indication of the next steps, and we’d remind readers that any compromise still has to clear the U.S. Senate. The major equity indices in Asia closed mostly in the red today, with both Japan’s Nikkei and South Korea’s Kospi falling 0.7%, China’s Shanghai Composite falling 0.4%, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was mostly flat. This morning the IMG announced that it expects to see Asia’s economy contract 2.2% in 2020, worse than its previously estimated 1.6% contraction. China’s economy is one of the few expected to grow, and the IMG upgraded its forecast to 1.9% from the prior 1% expected by in June. By midday trading, European markets were relatively flat while US equity futures point to a drop at the open. Data DownloadCoronavirusThe number of people hospitalized yesterday for Covid-19 in the U.S. has risen over 40,000 for the first time since August 21, and the number of deaths was the highest in nearly three weeks. Germany has reported more than 10,000 new daily cases for the first time, smashing through the previous record high of 7,830.International EconomyGermany’s GfK Consumer Confidence for November worsened, falling to -3.1 from the prior -1.7, a bigger decline than the -2.8 expected. This is the lowest level in four months as coronavirus cases are rapidly rising in the nation.France’s Business Confidence for October also declined, falling to 93 from 94 versus expectations for an increase to 96. France’s Business Climate Indicator also declined, to 90 from 92.The UK’s CBI Industrial Trends for Orders in October remains in negative territory but improved more than expected to -34 from -48 versus expectations for just -45, indicating that the manufacturing sector is still struggling. The CBI Business Optimism Index for manufacturing for Q4 improved to 0 from -1 - so little change here. Export sentiment fell at a slightly quicker pace than in the previous period (-21 vs. -17 in Q3), as Brexit talks continue to be unproductive.Looking ahead to the coming quarter, manufacturers expect output to grow at a moderate pace, but total new orders are anticipated to remain unchanged, reflecting steady growth in domestic orders and a slower fall in export orders. Employment is expected to be broadly unchanged in the next quarter, following six quarters of decline. Nearly one-third of manufacturers are concerned that access to materials or components may limit their output over the quarter ahead (likely a Brexit issue), while they are less concerned that access to finance could constrain near-term output or investment plans.Domestic EconomyOn the domestic front today, we will get the usual weekly Initial Jobless Claims, Bloomberg Comfort, Conference Board Leading Index, Existing Home Sales, and Kansas City Manufacturing report.MarketsAfter fluctuating between gains and losses throughout most of yesterday’s session, the S&P 500 decreased by 0.2% in what we can only describe as an indecisive day in the markets due to the continued fiscal stimulus talks in the U.S. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved 0.4% lower and the Russell 2000 closed down 0.9%. Crude oil fell 4%.Stocks to WatchShares of Quest Diagnostics (DGX) are moving higher in pre-market trading following the company reporting blowout September quarter results, given the demand for COVID-19 testing. The company raised its guidance and now expects revenue of $8.8-$9.1 billion with EPS of $9.00-$10.00 up from its prior guidance of $8.4-$8.8 billion and $7.50-$9.00. Coca-Cola (KO) beat top and bottom-line expectations for the September quarter with EPS of $0.55 vs. the $0.46 consensus. Organic revenue for the quarter fell 6% YoY, better than the -8.5% consensus. Unit case volume declined 4%, as continued strength in at-home channels was more than offset by coronavirus-related pressure in away-from-home channels. For the quarter, sparkling soft drinks declined 1%; juice, dairy, and plant-based beverages declined 6%; water, enhanced water, and sports drinks declined 11%; and tea and coffee declined 15%Southwest Airlines (LUV) reported a September quarter loss of $1.99 per share, $0.26 ahead of the -$2.25 consensus. Revenue fell 68.2% YoY in the quarter to $1.79 billion vs. the $1.71 billion consensus. While the company is encouraged by improving trends in leisure passenger traffic, it still believes that until a vaccine is widely available and some sort of herd immunity results, passenger traffic, and booking trends are likely to remain fragile. The average core cash burn was approximately $12 million per day in September and $16 million per day in the third quarter of 2020 vs. ~$23 million per day in the June quarter. American Airlines (AAL) also bested quarterly expectations with EPS of -$5.54 vs. the -$5.75 consensus. Revenues during the quarter fell 73.4% YoY to $3.17 billion vs. the $2.81 billion consensus. The company expects its December quarter system capacity to be down more than 50% YoY, with international capacity down 75% YoY.International Consolidated Airlines Group (BABWF) - the parent company of British Airways, AerLingus, Iberia, and Vueling - announced that it will be flying just 30% of last year’s schedule in the last three months of 2020, below the previously anticipated 40%. Bookings have been worse than expected as new coronavirus cases sweep through its biggest markets, and planes have been flying on average less than 50% full during the quarter. The company will formally announce results next week and warned that it would record an operating loss, before exceptional items, of €1.3 billion, worse than consensus estimates.Hermes (HESAY) sales returned to the green in the third quarter thanks to strong demand for its luxury goods in Asia, which offset continued weakness in Europe. Sales rose 6.9% on a comparable basis, well above expectations for a 1% decline. Leather goods, its largest division, rose 7.8% on a comparable basis.Unilever (UL) saw better-than-expected sales growth of 23.2% in the third quarter, beating expectations for an increase of just 1.3%. Sals of Lifebuoy soap rose 67% in the year-to-date, making it a €1 billion euro brand. Thankfully for those of us who are socializing to a limited extent, the prior significant decline in purchases of personal care products such as deodorant recovered in the third quarter. September quarter revenue and EPS at Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) came in ahead of expectations led by expanded customer adoption of Quantum Network Gateways, CloudGuard, Infinity Total Protection, and Beyond the Perimeter (BTP) – endpoint and mobile security solutions.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) handily beat September quarter EPS expectations as revenue rose 14.1% YoY, modestly ahead of the consensus estimate. Comparable restaurant sales for the quarter increased +8.3% YoY while digital sales grew 202.5% yr/yr to $776.4 million, 48.8% of sales for the quarter. The company says it's currently testing delivery price increases, and so far in October, digital continues to account for high 40s, percentage-wise, of its overall mix. Given uncertainty due to the second virus wave, the company opted not to provide guidance.Semiconductor capital equipment company Lam Research (LRCX) reported September quarter EPS of $5.67 vs. the $4.12 consensus. Revenue for the quarter jumped 46.7% YoY, topping the consensus forecast. Per the company, work and learn from home trends continue to drive demand in key electronics categories, including PCs, storage, and networking. During the company’s earnings conference call, management noted, “The net result will be a pull-forward of key long-term secular growth themes for the semiconductor industry, including accelerated build-out of cloud data centers and expansion of high-speed communication networks.” Lam issued upside guidance for the current quarter with EPS of $5.20-6.00 vs. the $4.46 consensus.Tesla (TSLA) reported September quarter revenue and EPS that topped consensus expectations. The upside for the quarter was led by the substantial growth in vehicle deliveries YoY, which offset the modest YoY decline in vehicle average selling price as product mix continues to shift from Model S and Model X to the more affordable Model 3 and Model Y. The company aims to achieve its original 2020 guidance of 500,000 deliveries, despite operational interruptions earlier this year and expects to roll out a wide release of self-driving beta by the end of this year.Whirlpool (WHR) crushed consensus expectations for its September quarter with EPS of $6.91, $2.71 ahead of the consensus forecast. Revenue for the quarter rose 3.9% YoY. Organic sales for the quarter rose 7% YoY, led by solid global demand.

150,"Oct 22, 2020 7:00AM EDT","By Ben Klayman and Paul LienertDETROIT, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Missed out on the Tesla rally but still want to surf the electric vehicle wave?A stream of EV-related startups backed by blank-check firms are lining up to go public so there's plenty of choice. But like Tesla in the early days, few have products ready to sell or any likelihood of generating significant revenue anytime soon.Instead, investors will be relying on rosy production, sales and revenue forecasts for new cars, trucks and batteries, all set to be jostling for a slice of markets that will be far more crowded than when Tesla's TSLA.O cars first hit the road.Take Fisker Inc, for example. It was launched in 2016, just three years after the bankruptcy of its predecessor and early Tesla rival Fisker Automobile.In July, Fisker Inc announced a $2.9 billion reverse merger deal with Spartan Energy Acquisition Corp SPAQ.N, a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC), and is planning to go public later this year.It has no revenue and its Fisker Ocean electric sports-utility vehicle (SUV) is at least two years away from production in a project heavily dependent on nailing down deals with partners who will build the car and provide key components.That's not particularly unique for young companies in the sector looking to use SPACs to go public and bypass the scrutiny of a traditional IPO process, according to company presentations and interviews with executives and investors. That also didn't seem to be an issue earlier this year when U.S. electric truck maker Nikola Motors NKLA.O used a SPAC to go public. Shares in the company that hopes to generate revenue next year almost trebled after listing on the Nasdaq exchange.But they slumped when a short-seller questioned whether founder Trevor Milton had made false claims about Nikola's technology, forcing the 38-year-old entrepreneur to step down as executive chairman - and making some investors more cautious.Nikola and Milton have publicly rejected the accusations and have threatened to take legal action against the short-seller, Hindenberg Research. ""Good storytelling is an important component of being a good founder and entrepreneur - but it better not be the only component,"" says Evangelos Simoudis, managing partner and founder of startup investor Synapse Partners.Fisker Inc's founder Henrik Fisker is well known in the industry, for designing sports cars such as Aston Martin's Vantage, and for his failed EV firm Fisker Automobile that went bust in 2013 after burning through more than $1 billion.Fisker Automotive missed targets on revenue, pricing, production and sales before the collapse of its battery supplier forced it to suspend production of its Fisker Karma, which first reached customers about two years later than planned and sold for a much higher price than originally announced.This time around, he is confident he has learned from his mistakes and won't be one of the startups planning to go public that fails to meet investors' expectations.""A lot of them will not succeed in launching a successful product on time ... that's just a fact,"" he told Reuters. ""The question then is how much are investors willing to forgive?""He also said Nikola's woes should make potential investors look closer at what they were buying into.""It probably was a bit of a wake-up call for investors to really dig a little deeper into these deals and maybe think about what are the real costs and effort to take to get a vehicle to market and maybe understand a little more about how difficult and complicated this industry is,"" Fisker said.Investors say Fisker Inc shares some characteristics with other young automotive startups, such as a difficulty in raising funds from private investors and optimistic projections for revenue and profits, as well as production.Its Ocean prototype is a stylish mid-size SUV with a base price target of $37,500 and production set to start in late 2022. It will enter a market that is soon to be crowded by Tesla's Model Y, Ford Motor's F.N Mustang Mach E, VW's VOWG_p.DE ID.4 and at least half a dozen other brands.The Ocean's price target is $2,500 below the ID.4, which goes on sale later this year at just under $40,000.In its presentation to investors in July, Fisker Inc said it expected to produce 175,000 cars in 2024, earning revenue of $10.6 billion and pretax profit of $2 billion that year.""This is not only based on the Fisker Ocean. We are planning other vehicles as well,"" said Fisker. ""It's a reasonable, good forecast and at the end of the day it's a forecast. It's not something anybody can guarantee.""""When you're a new car company and specifically when you make electric vehicles, it's almost impossible to really forecast what your sales will be,"" he told Reuters.Bill Rinna, director of Americas vehicle forecasts at LMC Automotive, projects total U.S. EV sales in 2024 will just top 1 million. Tesla could account for half that volume, with GM, Ford and VW taking significant shares as well, analysts say.Trade publication Automotive News predicts nearly 100 new pure electric and hybrid electric vehicles will go on sale in the United States by 2024.Fisker Inc boasts an ""asset light"" business model that is heavily dependent on using partners both for a vehicle platform and a manufacturing plant - neither of which were locked in before it announced its SPAC deal in July.Fisker also said then it was negotiating with VW to use its MEB electric car platform and related components for the Ocean.On Oct. 15, Fisker announced a preliminary deal with Canadian auto parts supplier Magna International MG.TO, which has agreed to assemble the Ocean at one of its European plants and to provide the mechanical platform for the vehicle.In an SEC filing the same day, Spartan Energy warned investors that Fisker and Magna ""have not entered into a binding definitive agreement"" to build the Ocean. The filing also noted that Fisker does not have a deal with VW to use its platform and is still negotiating a parts supply deal.Asked whether the Ocean's production timetable was still on track, Fisker said: ""All I can tell you is we are on the time schedule.""In the wake of Nikola's setbacks, investor concerns about potential red flags for other auto startups backed by SPACs have started to hit the shares of the blank-check companies.""When you have no product and zero revenue, it comes down to the story that you're telling,"" said Marc Weiser, co-founder of investor RPM Ventures. ""In the case of companies with unproven potential, it's pure speculation - and huge risk.""Nikola shares slumped from June high of $93.99 to just $16.15 on Sept. 24 but since have recovered slightly to $22.24. Shares in Fisker's backer Spartan Energy are at $12.27, down from a July peak of $21.58.Shares in DiamondPeak Holdings DPHCU.O, which is backing Lordstown Motors, are down 33% from their September peak and Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp KCAC.N, which is behind battery maker QuantumScape, are down 45%.Two-year-old Lordstown Motors hopes to pit its $52,500 Endurance electric pickup late next year against rivals from Tesla, Ford, General Motors GM.N, Rivian, Nikola and others.Lordstown and DiamondPeak told investors in September the truckmaker projects revenue of $3.5 billion and pretax profit of $300 million in 2023.Ten-year-old battery startup QuantumScape has a promising new solid-state battery cell and financial backing from Volkswagen, but has said it is years away from commercial production and meaningful revenue.Whether fund managers dangling blank-check deals will pursue a more cautious approach in the post-Nikola environment, despite the potential red flags, remains an open question.But with Nikola as a cautionary tale, and Fisker sparking additional concerns, some investors have become more choosy.""We will spend much more of our time and our focus on companies that are already in revenue or ... are soon to be in revenue,"" Barry Engle, former president of General Motors North America and head of Qell Acquisition Corp, which is evaluating EV-related startups.(Reporting by Ben Klayman and Paul Lienert in Detroit; Editing by David Clarke)((Paul.Lienert@thomsonreuters.com; mobile +1 313-670-2452;))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/insight-auto-startups-chasing-tesla-race-past-red-flags-to-go-public-2020-10-22

153,"Oct 22, 2020 6:11AM EDT","Sees Q4 sales up by about 12% from previous quarterRevenue from Huawei to be zero in Q4-CEOChip markets addressed by STMicro expected to grow in 2021-CEOAdds details, CEO quotePARIS, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Franco-Italian chipmaker STMicroelectronicsSTM.BN is expecting strong demand from the car and mobile phone industries to boost sales growth in the fourth quarter as it braces for a loss of revenue from China's Huawei HWT.ULThe Geneva-based company, whose major clients include iPhone maker Apple AAPL.O and carmaker Tesla TSLA.O, was also positive on the outlook for 2021, helping its share to reverse  declines earlier on Thursday. STMicro said it was expecting fourth-quarter sales to grow by about 12% from the previous quarter to $2.99 billion and to generate a gross margin of about 38.5%, or two and a half percentage points higher than in the quarter that ended in September. This forecast takes into account the loss of sales from Huawei, the world's biggest telecoms equipment maker, following new curbs imposed by U.S. authorities, which barred companies from supplying or servicing the company. ""After thirty quarters of consecutive revenue growth with Huawei, ST’s revenue from Huawei in Q4 will be zero,"" Chief Executive Officer Jean-Marc Chery said on a call.""We have stopped shipping any pieces to Huawei (on) Sept. 15,"" he said. Chery also said he expected the markets that STMicro serves to grow in 2021.STMicro's shares were up by 1.25% at 0919 GMT, reversing losses of more than 1% earlier on Thursday. Amit B Harchandani, analyst at Citi said: ""C4Q20 sales outlook is robust though and ~9% ahead of consensus.""The Geneva-based company said its gross margin for three months ended Sept. 30 was 36%, in-line with its own forecast.Its diluted earnings per share for the period amounted to $0.26, slightly below an analyst mean estimate of 28 cents, according to a consensus compiled by Refinitiv IBES. Earlier this month, STMicro said a sharp rise in automotive and microcontrollers demand helped it beat its own forecast for sales in the third-quarter, setting it on course to top its 2020 guidance.

154,"Oct 22, 2020 3:31AM EDT","Image source: The Motley Fool.Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)Q3 2020 Earnings CallOct 21, 2020, 5:30 p.m. ETOperatorLadies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Tesla Q3 2020 financial results and Q&A webcast. [Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. Martin Viecha, senior director of investor relations. Please go ahead, sir.Martin Viecha -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsThank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's third-quarter 2020 Q&A webcast. I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. Our Q3 results were announced at about 1 p.m. Pacific time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. [Operator instructions] But before we jump into the Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Tesla wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.See the 10 stocks*Stock Advisor returns as of October 20, 2020Elon? Elon Musk -- Chief Executive OfficerThanks, Martin. All right. So Q3 was our best quarter in history. We achieved record production and deliveries, record revenue, record net income, both GAAP and non-GAAP, and record free cash flow of $1.4 billion.This is really due to the amazing execution by the Tesla team. I could not be more proud to work with such a great group of people. Just really k****** performance across — throughout the world. Of course, we had our Battery Day.So we hosted — showed our plans for how we can expand in the future and improve core battery technology, core cell technology at the form factor level, chemistry level and I think most significantly at the manufacturing technology level. There's only — a comment I made in the past is that I think Tesla's long-term competitive strength will be primarily manufacturing. This is counterintuitive, but I'm quite confident this will be what happens. All right.So we presented what the team has been working on for a long time with batteries. We wanted to step back and really rethink batteries from scratch. First principles thinking, just look at it from fundamental physics and say what — rather than compare to other products in the market, just say from a physics standpoint, if you — what's the limit of physics? What's the platonic idea of a perfect cell and how close can we get there? And that was our aspiration. And I think we've got a pretty good approach to it, which will only get better over time.And we went through all of the interesting solutions for every important part of battery design and production. And we'll continue to iterate on that and just recursively improve the core cell and battery technology. The result, we think, in a few years, will be batteries that cost half as much and where the capital expenditures required are one-third or less of what they are today. And we expect Giga Berlin will see our first battery cell production line at scale.Regarding the Full Self-Driving beta release. The Autopilot team, again, just a really all-star team. I spent a lot of time with the Autopilot team. And there's a lot of really talented people in that team who've worked incredibly hard to make the — to get the beta release out.So I'd just really like to thank them for their hard work. And it's just a very smart group of people. So I think we're starting very slow and very cautiously because the world is a complex and messy place. And so we're — we put it out there last night, and then we'll see how it goes and then probably release it to more people this weekend or early next week.And then just gradually step it up until we have, hopefully, a wide release by the end of this year. And of course, as the system collects more data and — it becomes more robust. So it's sort of like how does Google as a search engine get better. It's because everyone is programming it by asking questions all the time and clicking on particular links.So it's got this great feedback loop, and that makes it an extremely effective search engine. It's the same thing for autonomy. Having on the order of one million cars that are providing feedback and specifically feedback on strange corner case situations that you just can't even come up with in simulation, this is the thing that is really valuable. It's not like the obvious stuff, obvious stuff you can do in simulation.But weird corner cases, only a reality can give you that. So that's — but we're able to say, OK, we need to train the system on this corner case situation and look for examples so we can then try it against those examples and improve some very esoteric corner cases. And it's also important to emphasize that this is a generalized neural net-based approach. There is no need for high-definition maps or a cellphone connection.So the car — the system is designed such that even if you have no connectivity whatsoever and you're in a place that you have never been to before and no Tesla has ever been there, the car should still be able to drive, just like a person. That is the system that we are developing and aiming to release this year. Then in terms of capacity build out, we're making progress on three major factories. We're continuing to expand Shanghai significantly, which is going incredibly well.The Tesla China team is just, I mean, incredibly good. Super smart, work hard. It's like I'm always amazed by how much progress the Tesla China team makes. It's beyond all reasonable expectations.And then we're under construction in Berlin and Texas — and Austin. So we're also making good progress there. Yes. Good.It's overall going well. I should make a point that for Berlin and Austin, we do expect to start delivering cars from those factories next year. But because of the exponential nature of the spool up of a manufacturing plant, especially one with new technology, it will start off very slow at first and then become very — upward, will become very large. Just in general, manufacturing follows the S-curve.And I think sometimes, people, if they haven't spent a lot of time manufacturing, kind of think that once you have a factory, you can just sort of turn it on and it's at capacity. But it will typically take about 12 to 18 months to reach capacity. And that is a very fast period of time, especially for new technology. So yes, I'd say 12 to 24 months even.So generally, what I see is the manufacturing capacity is underestimated in the beginning for quite some time. Then it is sometimes overestimated because this is an S-curve. It goes exponential to linear to logarithmic. And it's actually an incredibly hard thing just bringing a production plant up to volume technology.If — because you can actually think of it like you've got, through first-order approximation, 10,000 unique parts or processes, all of which operate on an S-curve and — with a bunch of uncertainty, and you can just slide 10,000 S-curves on an X-axis, and that's what bringing up a large automotive plant is like. And which one is the laggard, which one is the leader, it's very difficult to tell, and it's constantly changing. So it's really one of the most difficult challenges I've ever seen. So let's see.In conclusion, thank you. What we've achieved would not be possible without the incredible hard work of tens of thousands of Tesla employees and all people at our suppliers as well. I'd like to thank our suppliers. We continue to grow as fast as we can while focusing on cost control and improving quality.And ultimately, the best company will be that which makes great products at an affordable price, and that's our goal. I think I've never felt more optimistic about the future of Tesla than I do today. I'd also like to thank investors who have stuck with us through thick and thin. This is — I think there's a lot more good stuff to come.All right. With that, we can move to questions.Martin Viecha -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsThank you, Elon. I think our CFO, Zachary Kirkhorn, has some opening remarks as well.Elon Musk -- Chief Executive OfficerOK. Sure.Zachary Kirkhorn -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. Thanks, Martin. Overall, our financial health continues to rapidly improve with Q3 being another great quarter on nearly all dimensions, as Elon has mentioned. On net income, we achieved our fifth sequential quarter of profitability, our best net income, and nearly double-digit operating margins.Two things that are important to note to set context for Q3 profitability. First, the regulatory credits business was stronger than our expectations, and we are tracking to more than double this year compared to last. Second, as a result in the rise of the market cap of the company, the second and third tranche of the CEO grant vested during the quarter. Additionally, we have begun expensing one more tranche, resulting in roughly $300 million of combined period expense.I think it's reasonable to view the quarter excluding both these items to get a true sense of the health of the core business. On automotive gross margin, including regulatory credits, it increased materially from 18.7% to 23.7%, with some of our programs achieving greater than 25% gross margin. Keep in mind that inefficiencies related to factory shutdowns affected our margins in Q2. We continue to reduce our manufacturing and operational costs.We are also seeing benefits from the ongoing upward trend of locally built and delivered cars, which has increased from under 50% at the beginning of last year to over 70% most recently, which is a core component of our cost reduction strategy. We are also seeing financial benefits from improved vehicle reliability across the feet — across the fleet. Services and other margin approved yet again, driven by our used vehicle business and efficiencies in our service operations. In the Energy business, we achieved record storage deployments, aided by the positive reception of the Megapack and Powerwall products as production and deployments grow.Additionally, our solar deployments doubled, and we're continuing to make progress on that front. On cash flows, our cash balance increased to $14.5 billion, which includes free cash flows of $1.4 billion, our highest yet. Our operating cash flows were $2.4 billion, including a $600 million benefit from working capital as we've made progress on days of receivables and inventory despite a reduction in days of payables. Note that the majority of our operating cash flows are driven by the strengthening of our core operations.Capital expenses grew to $1 billion, driven by Model Y investments in Shanghai, Berlin and Austin. As were previous investments in Model 3 Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, we're expecting these programs to have already fully paid for their respective investments by the end of this year. Looking forward to 2021 and 2022, we have revised up our expectations for capital spending by $2 billion to $2.5 billion, which we have ample liquidity and expected cash flows to fund. This is driven by an increase in in-source scope for certain factories, including battery cell manufacturing, as well as investments to enable greater capacity expansion in the future.While we expect the return on our investments to remain very strong, keep in mind that with additional scope and location-specific costs, the payback of these investments may be slightly longer than what we saw in Model 3 in Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont. Financing cash flows were $4.5 billion as we reduced use of our working capital lines, offset by a $5 billion equity raise in September. Note that we're currently expecting over $1 billion in early convert paydowns in Q4, primarily associated with the 2021 conversions, but also our 2022 and 2024. Looking forward, we remain focused on strengthening the core fundamentals of the business.We are increasing production to meet demand, reducing costs, including localization, driving higher efficiency across the business and tightening our cash conversion cycle. We've made tremendous progress on this front over the last 1.5 years. We're also aiming to achieve our original 2020 guidance of 500,000 deliveries despite the operational interruptions earlier in the year. While this goal remains a genuine challenge, we believe it's possible with tight execution across the company.So congratulations again to the Tesla team for a great quarter and a great year. I'll hand it over to RJ Johnson, who joined Tesla earlier in the year and is leading our Energy business for a few comments.RJ Johnson -- Global Head of Commercial EnergyThank you, Zach. First, I'd like to also thank and congratulate the team on a job well done. Q3 was a strong quarter for the Energy business, and we're poised for continued strong growth in Energy storage and solar. Megapack is going to be a large growth segment for the business, and deployments will continue to expand rapidly as the product reaches full capacity.We have more demand than supply through 2021, and we continue to ramp the product to match unprecedented demand across the globe through 2023 and beyond. Our order book is rapidly filling up through 2023 in a multiple gigawatt-hour scale. Large-scale solar plus storage is now more cost-effective than traditional fossil fuel generation in many locations across the globe. This trend will continue as we remove cost, which will further displace existing and new fossil fuel generation.This is true for stand-alone storage as well. Many customers are utilizing Autobidder to maximize returns as we optimize our hardware and software with advanced real-time bidding strategies that continue to outperform the market where deployed. For Powerwall, we see continued strong demand for residential storage as customers seek increased reliability and backup home generation. We have a very large backlog of Powerwall orders, and we continue to invest to increase capacity to fulfill customer orders.We're just now capturing the full power of customer-sited solar plus storage as customers in some jurisdictions are providing services back to the grid when they don't need to consume energy or have backup power. This has massive potential to reduce system cost and make the grid more efficient globally. In the United States, we lowered our residential solar retrofit price to $1.49 a watt after tax incentives, which is the lowest in the industry. We're able to do this by leveraging our online vehicle ordering infrastructure, which substantially reduces the soft costs associated with sales and marketing.As a result, our fixed costs remained relatively flat as our volume and efficiency increase, leading to increased profitability in the retrofit business. We're using the same methodology across the entire Energy business, including service, to capitalize on the technology backbone of the company. Solar Roof is especially exciting as we've gained significant experience over the last year in the installation process, which is a key enabler to scale the business. We've recently demonstrated our ability to complete Solar Roof installation in just one day.Please note, this still requires one to two days to remove the existing roof and prepare it for the Solar Roof installation. Clearly, there will be a range of installation times based on size, complexity, weather and other factors. Overall, our reduced installation time provides a better customer experience and will enable the business to grow exponentially as scale effects allow for increased efficiency. In closing, we believe the Energy segment is poised for a strong growth as we continue to focus on increasing scale while reducing cost to maximize profitability.I want to thank the team again for their hard work, and I look forward to another strong quarter ahead of us.Martin Viecha -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsThank you very much, everyone. And let's begin with questions from say.com. The first question from retail shareholders is, is Tesla planning to start 4680 cell production at Giga Berlin at the same time as vehicle production? Can Tesla share more information on what products will use the battery cells from the pilot line in Fremont?Elon Musk -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. Drew, do you want to take that?Drew Baglino -- Senior Vice President, Powertrain and Energy Engineering ; Vice President, TechnologySure. Yes, we will incorporate 4680 design solutions into many applications in time across both energy and vehicle. And we can use our pilot production facility in Fremont to support the new factory in Berlin as it ramps.Martin Viecha -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsThank you very much. Let's go to the next question, which is question No. 2 from retail shareholders. Does Tesla's tabless cell design allow for significantly higher peak charging rates? Does it improve the required taper curve?Drew Baglino -- Senior Vice President, Powertrain and Energy Engineering ; Vice President, TechnologyYes. The fundamental limitation on charge rate in lithium-ion batteries is avoiding lithium plating on the anode. And while the tabless architecture helps avoid overheating because it's a more power-dense architecture at high continuous charge rates, it doesn't change the anode plating story. Electro design and anode material choice more directly determines the maximum charge rate and how to avoid that lithium plating problem.Martin Viecha -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsOK. Thank you very much. The third question from retail is, would FSD be able to be transferred to our next vehicle or pay a transfer fee? It would add a broad — it would add to brand loyalty the same way gaming companies and cellphone companies keep you in their ecosystem by letting you transfer purchases to upgraded hardware.Elon Musk -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. I think we'll give it some thought.Martin Viecha -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsOK. The fourth question is, what are the remaining constraints to be solved for Solar Roof installations to ramp significantly? Carl?Carl Peterson -- Director of EngineeringYes. I'm Carl Peterson. I'm on the Solar Roof engineering and installation. The biggest constraint right now in Solar Roof ramp is getting enough installers on board and trained and experienced.We've made a lot of progress on this in Q3, and we're continuing to hire. The next opportunity is improving the material flow on the job site. We've talked about this a lot in the factory as well that setting up the right packaging, kitting so that every installer on the roof has the parts they need at their fingertips. Also, we've had great response from third-party roofing contractors as they're ramping up installations for Solar Roof on their customer homes, which is a big source of future growth.Martin Viecha -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsThank you, Carl.Elon Musk -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. I mean here's the way to think about that product, in my opinion. You have to say, I think, what do you want the world to look like? When you look around the neighborhood in the future, decade from now, what do you want? What products are going to make your life better? What future do you want? And I think a future where we've got beautiful roofs generating energy that are tough and resilient and better in every way than a regular roof and alive with energy, that's the future we want. Solar Roof is a killer product.This will become obvious next year.Martin Viecha -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsThank you. And the last question from retail shareholders is, you recently referred to Tesla as a conglomerate of start-ups. Other than manufacturing electric cars, what do you suppose will be the most valuable business units within Tesla over the next five to seven years? Could you envision any of them ever spinning out from Tesla?Elon Musk -- Chief Executive OfficerWell, yes, as I think about this today, I mean Tesla is probably — there's in excess of a dozen start-ups effectively in Tesla. Every major product line is a start-up. Every big new plant is a start-up. And sometimes, frankly, we have to learn the lesson a few times before it sinks in.But even things like service and sales are start-ups. Other car companies, OEMs, they don't own their sales and service. So we have to create our service network. We have to create our sales and delivery network.We have to do this in, I don't know, 40 countries, multiple languages. Something that people don't really even know much about is our internal applications team that writes the core technology that runs the company. We are not dependent on enterprise software. Like for those who understand what this means, this is a very big deal.And my hat is off to the great work of the internal applications team. They are like the nervous system, the operating system of the company, the Tesla operating system, extremely fundamental. Obviously, insurance is substantial. So insurance could very well be, I don't know, 30%, 40% of the value of the car business, frankly.And as we've talked about before, with a much better feedback loop, instead of being statistical, it can be specific. And obviously, somebody does not have to choose our insurance. But I think a lot of people will. It's going to cost less and be better, so why wouldn't you? And the whole autonomy thing is a start-up.The computer chip was — designing our computer chips was a start-up. Obviously, cells are a start-up. Designing and making our own power electronics for the grave unit, designing, manufacturing our own motors. Chargers, the Supercharger network is a start-up.The thing, I think, that people just don't really understand about Tesla is that it's a whole chain of start-ups. And they're like, well, you didn't do that before. Yes, but we're doing it now. I mean I think, so far, we have not — we've maybe been a bit slow with some of the start-ups, but I don't think we've had any of them fail.So, so far, so good. No plans to spin anything out. That just sounds like added complexity.Martin Viecha -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsThank you very much. Let's go through institutional investor questions. The question No. 1 is, as a bridge to the ride-hailing network, could you leverage the insurance product to give customers the ability to rent out their vehicles via the app, thereby enabling the car to make money for them? So basically proprietary version of Turo.Elon Musk -- Chief Executive OfficerI think we're going to focus on enabling the robotaxi system. So you can just basically — like that's a sub — that's just really quite a small subset of the overall robotaxi or robocar thing, where you can have the car be autonomous for you. You can have the car be — share with friends and family. You can add or remove it from the network.You can have it be entirely in the network. I mean if you're an Uber or Lyft driver, you could be managing a fleet of 10 cars. This sort of seems like a shepherd tending the flock type of thing. It's like you just get more, way more leverage.So I think that's sort of — we could do that. It wouldn't be very difficult, but we're going to just be focused on just having an autonomous network that has sort of elements of Uber, Lyft and Airbnb. Yes.Martin Viecha -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsThank you. And the second question from institutionals is, residential energy use accounts for roughly the same magnitude of carbon emissions as road transport. Today's boilers and aircon units are profoundly unsexy. Could you elaborate on hints that HVAC advances with the Y could also find use in a domestic system?Drew Baglino -- Senior Vice President, Powertrain and Energy Engineering ; Vice President, TechnologyYes.Elon Musk -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. Go ahead, Drew.Drew Baglino -- Senior Vice President, Powertrain and Energy Engineering ; Vice President, TechnologyI was just going to say, I mean, I think one of the things we focused on with the Model Y and now Model 3 heat pump system was learning how to build a tightly integrated system capable of moving heat to and from anywhere really, powertrain, battery, cabin, the environment, outside ambient temperatures, all the way down to like negative 20 C, so 30 C. And that's definitely applicable to the home needs of heating and cooling the home and the water in your house, so certainly applicable. Elon?Elon Musk -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. Absolutely. I think like the heat — for heat pump in the car, being able to use the batteries both as a thermal and an electric energy reservoir is very significant. Same thing could be applied to a home with the water heater, and the back of pack itself, of course.So I think there's potential for an integrated home system that kind of does power generation/storage, heating/cooling, air filtration, water purification in a really tight package. We don't actually have like a prototype or anything, but I think conceptually, that is something that would be probably good to have.Martin Viecha -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsThank you. The third question from institutionals is, if meeting your long-term volume targets requires price reductions that preclude you from achieving your low double-digit stated margin targets for the auto business, will you still reduce prices accordingly?Elon Musk -- Chief Executive OfficerWell, we want to make our cars more affordable, and it's really important to separate out affordability from value for money. If the car is too expensive or any given product is too expensive, and people don't have enough money in their bank account, they simply can't buy it no matter what the value proposition is. So it is important to lower the prices in order to — such that people can literally just have enough money to buy it. I do not think we lack for desire for our product, but we do lack for affordability.And so we have to improve the affordability of our products so they are not out of reach of people. We want to bring them more in reach over time but also improve our cost of production. Obviously, we get hopefully a little bit better every year, sometimes a lot better. And in terms of margins, all of these margins are going to look pretty comically small when you factor in autonomy.Zachary Kirkhorn -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. Two things I'll add to that. Without a doubt, I mean, we're moving forward to push as much volume as we reasonably can. So Elon talked to earlier kind of how the S-curve and the time line of incremental factories looks like.And so we're moving full speed ahead with as much volume as we can reasonably move forward with. The second comment I'd make is, if you just look at the journey of the company over the last 1.5 years, we have grown volumes and grown gross margins despite a number of price reductions over that period of time, and we have cut OpEx fairly stable during that period of time as well. And so the key is what Elon mentioned here. I mean we have to improve the affordability of the vehicle.We have to also continue to make progress improving the cost structure of not only COGS but of OpEx, which we've demonstrated over the last 1.5 years, I think, quite successfully, and improve the value of the vehicles at the same time. So in addition to reducing the cost of the car, we're making the cars better. And that's the formula to sell the volume. That's what we're focused on.Martin Viecha -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsThank you very much. The fourth question from institutionals is, at what point do you expect to have enough internal or external battery capacity to start ramping up stationary storage deployments again?Elon Musk -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. We're ramping up stationary storage a lot. So I mean, it's approximately doubling. We expect it's approximately double next year.So that's pretty good. And hopefully, we can accelerate that in years to come.Drew Baglino -- Senior Vice President, Powertrain and Energy Engineering ; Vice President, TechnologyAnd approximately doubling it this year, too. So the growth...Elon Musk -- Chief Executive OfficerYes, yes, yes. I mean if you just keep doubling things, pretty soon, you hit the mass of the universe, and we'll need to start turning Jupiter into cells.Martin Viecha -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsAnd the last question from institutionals is, manufacturing is hard. Delays happen. What contingencies do you have in place to ensure that bottlenecks that you might encounter while renting internal cell production will not preclude you from your ability to hit your Model Y production volume targets in Berlin and Texas?Elon Musk -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. So I think it's — we're trying to derisk 2021 so that there's almost no dependency on our internal cell production. It's very, very small. The internal cell production will help us ramp in '22, but we're not dependent on it for '21.Drew Baglino -- Senior Vice President, Powertrain and Energy Engineering ; Vice President, TechnologyAnd to derisk the manufacturing system itself, that was one of the reasons why we located our pilot production facility here in Fremont, so we can rapidly iterate on manufacturing scale-up challenges, provide rapid feedback to the design of both the product and the equipment.Elon Musk -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. And our pilot line is pretty big as pilot lines go. It's — it will be in the top 10 cell factories on Earth, I believe.Drew Baglino -- Senior Vice President, Powertrain and Energy Engineering ; Vice President, TechnologyYes. That's true.Elon Musk -- Chief Executive OfficerSubscale one, yes, so...Martin Viecha -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsThank you very much. And now we can go to questions from analysts online. Sherry?OperatorThank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question will come from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.Rod Lache -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystHi, everybody. Just wanted to ask about the targets from your Battery Day. Looked like you could be approaching something like 20 million vehicles by 2030 if you hit those goals. Could you maybe share with us a little bit more of a midterm target, like where would you be by 2025? And maybe give us a little bit more insight into the investment required to get there, just to put that extra $2 billion to $2.5 billion per year into context.Elon Musk -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. I mean I think the tricky thing with trying to predict things midway through an exponential is that if things are doubling every year or even just growing 50%, then if you shift one — plus/minus one year, it has a huge effect on the number. So — and it sounds like, wow, you either massively exceeded or massively undershot. But it's — actually, what's going on is a giant S-curve.So a whole bunch of pretty big S-curves that integrate into a gigantic S-curve. So that's why it's difficult to predict the middle. And I'm not saying for sure we'll hit 20 million vehicles. But it does seem like a good goal to have because that would mean that we're replacing 1% of the global fleet per year.And it's difficult to say that we're — are we really changing the world if we're not switching out 1% of the global fossil fuel vehicles? I mean I'm not sure that we can make that argument unless we change at least 1% of the vehicles per year. So that's where the two — the 20 million vehicle per year comes from. It's like 1% of two billion vehicles, which is the global fleet currently. The global fleet is growing.So probably will be a bit bigger in the future. So it's hard to say. It's like map an S-curve to a $20 million — a 20 million vehicle target in 2030, and we will slide it around and see what that number looks like. That will give you about as much insight as we have.Rod Lache -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystOK. And just secondly, if solid-state lithium metal were to become viable, could you just maybe just pass along your perspective on that? And would you be able to repurpose most of what you're putting into place for changes in technology?Elon Musk -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. I mean answering the first part, the cell production system is fairly agnostic on anode, cathode, electrolyte, separator, that kind of thing. We could change, and we will change, and upgrade all aspects of the cell. So — and we could, for example, make ion phosphate or nickel manganese or something like that.It's quite adaptable. So I wouldn't say just too much more about it. The lithium, like a pure lithium anode is maybe not — it's not as great as it may sound. Yes.Volumetrically, you're not gaining all that much because if you got nothing on the — let's say on the anode side, you got — and you just play out lithium, it's got to go somewhere, so you got to have room for it.Drew Baglino -- Senior Vice President, Powertrain and Energy Engineering ; Vice President, TechnologyYes. Lithium is less volumetrically dense in the pure metal form than it is intercalated into silicon. So it's kind of hard to understand, but that's the truth. And then as we showed in our presentation, the total anode cost that we're talking about is only $1 or $2 per kilowatt hour.So the value of like removing the anode material isn't super high either. So yes, I fully agree, Elon.Elon Musk -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. Exactly. But if it turned out that a pure lithium anode is the right move, that would simply — that would be no problem.Drew Baglino -- Senior Vice President, Powertrain and Energy Engineering ; Vice President, TechnologyRight. Agreed.Rod Lache -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystThank you.OperatorOur next question will come from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.Colin Rusch -- Oppenheimer and Company Inc. -- AnalystThanks so much, guys. Yes. You're talking about in-sourcing a number of processes. Can you talk a little bit about which processes you're moving in-house and the equipment that you're planning to make yourself versus some of the equipment that you'd be buying from other folks?Elon Musk -- Chief Executive OfficerSorry. Are you talking about the — for cell manufacturing or selling or...Colin Rusch -- Oppenheimer and Company Inc. -- AnalystWell, cell manufacturing, I'm pretty sure as well as on the molds that you talked about. But in terms of the CapEx budget that you mentioned earlier, talking about the — a number of processes coming in-house and which equipment pieces you're planning to make yourself versus buying?Elon Musk -- Chief Executive OfficerOK. Well, I mean, Tesla is absolutely vertically integrated compared to other auto companies or basically most any company. We have a massive amount of internal manufacturing technology that we built ourselves. We literally make the machine.In fact, we design it — so like, OK, what are the things we want to make, design a machine that will make that thing, then we make the machine. This is what — this makes it quite difficult to copy Tesla, which we're not actually all that opposed to people copying us, but it's quite difficult because you can't do catalog engineering. You can't just I'll pick up the supplier catalog, I'll get one of those machines, one of that machine, bingo, I'm now Tesla. You have to — there is no catalog.What catalog — so we made the machine that made the machine that made the machine. It gets — no, no, we don't want to get carried away here. But — and quite frankly, we would like to outsource less. That would be great.Because then if we could outsource — if we take something that we're doing and outsource it, then we could take those people, and they — we're going to have them do something else. But yes, it's like we're just making a crazy amount of machinery internally. Tesla is not well understood. If you just walk around the factory, you'd just get a sense for it.And — yes. I don't know if this is like a smart move. But I just know like, hey, if we're trying to make progress and nobody's got the machines that we need, we've got to make it, so we do.Colin Rusch -- Oppenheimer and Company Inc. -- AnalystOK. And then the second question is really around the balance sheet has really changed. You guys have run off, land, and you've got a lot more cushion at this point. And obviously, there's opportunities around insurance to drive out some of the cost of ownership as well as financials.How are you guys thinking about that as you move into trying to accelerate demand a little bit and your ability to leverage your access to capital and enable some of those other products? Is that changing from where you've been in the past?Elon Musk -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. I mean something like insurance is a good example of a product that's basically made by our internal applications team. So we made the insurance product and connect it to the car, look at the data, calculate the risk. This is all internally — basically internal software application.It's pretty low capital but has very high return. I don't know. We're trying to spend money at the fastest rate that we can possibly spend it and not waste it. That's our current plan.And so it's quite hard to spend money without wasting it, or just — we're like really just trying to not waste too much of it, frankly. We will certainly waste some of it, but trying to waste, not to waste too much of it, this is very difficult. But otherwise, we just try to spend money as quickly as possible in a way that is sensible and yields more value than it costs.Colin Rusch -- Oppenheimer and Company Inc. -- AnalystThank you.OperatorOur next question will come from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.Adam Jonas -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystHey, Elon, a question on LIDAR. If LIDAR were totally free, would you want to use it in your cars near term? Would that tech significantly help Tesla on the training of your neural network for FSD?Elon Musk -- Chief Executive OfficerI mean totally free, well, I think probably — I think even if it was free, we wouldn't put it on.Adam Jonas -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystOK. Let's follow up then. Amazon appears to be investing and building an autonomous or electric transport network of some ilk through some organic investments, but also Zoox, Aurora, Rivian, etc. What advice would you give Jeff Bezos in his endeavor?Elon Musk -- Chief Executive OfficerWell, I don't know how much he cares about this, but I guess, he sure is investing a lot of money in it. I mean I think you obviously need to focus — if you care about autonomy, you need to focus on vision because the entire road system is based on passive optical. So you have to solve passive optical for — to have a self-driving system that is a generalized solution. And once you solve passive optical, you've solved self-driving, so why bother with anything else?Adam Jonas -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystThanks, Elon.OperatorOur next question will come from Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research. Please go ahead.Pierre Ferragu -- New Street Research -- AnalystHey. Thanks for taking my question. A very simple one. You haven't talked that much about like the Cybertruck today.And I was wondering how like the ramp of that product is looking like. When we should see the product hitting the road? And how fast do you expect to ramp volumes? Then I have a quick follow-up.Elon Musk -- Chief Executive OfficerSure. I was in the studio actually on — last Friday with Franz and the team just going over just sort of some improvements to the Cybertruck. Generally, at Tesla, we really aim to make the car that is delivered better than the car that is unveiled. Because it always drive me crazy, car companies would unveil these awesome looking cars, like, great, you can't wait until they make that.And then the car they actual make is like much worse, and — but it's just — it's like really disappointing? So man, we always want to make the car that we deliver be better than the car we unveil. And that's the goal with the Cybertruck. So there's like a lot of small improvements compared to what was unveiled. I think it's going to be better than what we showed.And yes, it's cool. Like it's going to be made in Austin. So it's kind of dependent on completing that factory. And there are obviously new technologies with the high hardness kind of armored exoskeleton.This is — it's never been done before, so there'll probably be some challenges along the way. And obviously, something that's extremely high hardness and difficult to scratch or dent is also difficult to form. So there's manufacturing challenges there. That's why it's so cleaner.Although it also looks good, I think, from a cleaner standpoint. Yes. If all goes well, we'll be able to do some Cybertruck deliveries toward the end of next year, yes. So it's difficult to predict.I would say there's probably a lot of deliveries in '22 and some deliveries toward the end of next year if things go well.Pierre Ferragu -- New Street Research -- AnalystOK. And now I'm trying to get a sense of how next year is going to look like. So if I look at your production capacity at the end of this year, it's going to be almost 850,000 units on an annualized basis. And you're going to increase capacity in Shanghai, open Berlin.You say today you would open Austin as well. So you're probably going to end the year above one million units. And so am I right thinking next year we should expect to deliver like somewhere like between 840,000 and one million cars during the year?Zachary Kirkhorn -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. We'll...Elon Musk -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. Go ahead, Zach.Zachary Kirkhorn -- Chief Financial OfficerYes, we'll provide guidance on 2021 after next earnings call.Elon Musk -- Chief Executive OfficerI mean it's in that vicinity. Yes. You're not far off.Pierre Ferragu -- New Street Research -- AnalystThank you.OperatorOur next question will come from Dan Levy with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.Dan Levy -- Credit Suisse -- AnalystHi. Good evening. Thank you. Just wanted to start with a question on the quarter.Zach, maybe you could give us a sense of where directionally Model Y and China Model 3 gross margin was in the quarter relative to Fremont Model 3? And then just a little more color on the gross margin in the quarter. Was this just purely a function of higher volume? Or was there also FSD revenues? Just puts and takes on the gross margin in the quarter.Zachary Kirkhorn -- Chief Financial OfficerSure. On your question about FSD, there was a small amount of that deferred revenue release. It's not particularly material in the $10 million range for the quarter. With respect to product margins, what we're seeing across the board is just continued reduction in cost, really across every product.Shanghai continues to make good progress there. Model Y cost is also coming down quite quickly as we ramp that. But we've guided in the past that Model Y cost should be roughly equivalent to the Model 3 built in Fremont costs. It's not quite there, and it's also a bit of a moving target.As Model 3 Fremont cost comes down, Model Y also has to come down with that. But we're generally seeing strength in Shanghai margin, strength in Model Y margins. And not too far off of this, we're seeing strength in Model 3 Fremont, S and X margins. So overall, for the quarter, I think it was quite a good story for the products.Dan Levy -- Credit Suisse -- AnalystGreat. Great. And then just as a follow-up, I wanted to ask about your strategy in Europe. And I think your strategy generally has been you cut costs and that allows you to cut price, and you can generate the extra volume.And I think that's what we're seeing in China and the use of LFP. That's a good example. So once you ramp in Berlin, what's the reasonable expectation of what pricing might look like in Europe? And how flexible are you going to be on pricing to generate incremental reg credit, so margins out of the gate that are a little low, but that are then used for the reg credits that help to offset that?Zachary Kirkhorn -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. But what I think I would say generally to the question is, I mean, we've been in a position for some time now where we are prioritizing where in the world we send our production. And there's different factors to that depending upon when different product changes are made, what the logistics routing looks like, different things going on in different markets. But we are in a position where we need to prioritize.I mean what we're trying to do as fast as we possibly can is get production up higher so that we're not in a position of needing to prioritize again. There are — yes, I think that gets at the sentiment of your question.OperatorOur next question will come from Gene Munster with Loup Ventures. Please go ahead.Gene Munster -- Loup Ventures -- Managing PartnerGood evening. A question on the Semi. If you could just walk us through the development of Megachargers, platooning and maybe just how you think about autonomy for Tesla Semi and what is — how you envision it impacting the broader trucking industry beyond just EV.Elon Musk -- Chief Executive OfficerWell, actually, Jerome, do you want to answer that?Jerome Guillen -- President, Automotive DivisionYes. We continue the development of the Semi. And in particular, Megachargers, we realized that the 350-kilowatt or so that we might be looking for cars is not going to be enough for Semi. So we're looking for something much more powerful than that, that can achieve essentially charging at first the Semi as during a break, during your driving time so that you can drive until the next break, yes.So there is no usable or efficient time wasted for charging the Semi. That's the goal. We're working with other parties to make sure that there is a standard infrastructure that will be able to be deployed for all customers. Yes.That's probably all I can say at this point, yes. So we're not working on...Elon Musk -- Chief Executive OfficerSorry. Go ahead.Jerome Guillen -- President, Automotive DivisionJust we're not working in isolation. Yes. We're trying to — we have to invent it because it doesn't exist. But we're trying to invent something that could be helpful for everybody.Elon Musk -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. Just a note on the sort of Semi. The Semi does consume a lot of cells. So it's, call it, four to six times more than a passenger vehicle.Vehicle, five, five-x-ish. So if we are cell-constrained, it is — it kind of — it's difficult to ramp up the Semi because there's no cells. So we need to solve the cell constraint before ramping Semi to significant volume. That's the only real constraint on Semi's progress.And just we found over and over again, we just kept running into cell production limitations. And then we're just taking things out of one pocket and putting them in another. So we just need more cells so that we can do more stationary storage, more vehicles, more vehicle lines. Matter of fact, we need more cells.Gene Munster -- Loup Ventures -- Managing PartnerMakes sense. A question just, as you think about — you've talked about robotaxi and how you think that's going to impact kind of humans moving around. How do you think about Semi impacting freight longer term? I mean is this something that is nice to have and a complement to all of your tech in new markets? Or do you think that this could be a material business?Elon Musk -- Chief Executive OfficerI think it's very material for sure. I mean really long term, all transport will go autonomous. Yes. Horses are already autonomous.But all transport will go autonomous, yes, so including Semi. So it will be pretty significant.Jerome Guillen -- President, Automotive DivisionThe technology that we're putting in Semi is identical to what we're putting in the other vehicles.Elon Musk -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. It's just bigger and more motors.Gene Munster -- Loup Ventures -- Managing PartnerYes. Thank you.OperatorOur next question will come from Ben Kallo with Baird. Please go ahead.Ben Kallo -- Robert W. Baird -- AnalystHey. Thanks for taking my question. Elon, what do you think the biggest structural issue is with the, let's call it, old school OEMs, or one or two of the structural issues, for them not getting their act together and catching up with you? And then you mentioned what you — we want the world to look like ahead of us. What do you envision that? Is it like just Tesla or Tesla and Rivian or what?Elon Musk -- Chief Executive OfficerWell, I do think there will be other car companies. I don't think we're going to be the only one. So I mean, the things that — like what other car companies do even in the auto segment is quite a small subset of what Tesla is. So Tesla, we design and build.We're very vertically integrated. So we're designing and building so much more of the car than other OEMs who will largely go to the traditional supply base and like I call it, catalog engineering. So it's not very adventurous, and it basically ends up like older products end up looking the same because they're going to the same suppliers. So I mean to the degree that you inherit legacy components, you inherit the legacy limitations and cost structure.And so you kind of need to make new ingredients, new parts, and then you need — then there's no machine to make those parts. So you have to make the machine that makes the part. So Tesla is like — we're probably — I mean we might be, in order of magnitude, more vertically integrated than other car companies. And which we're not now, we certainly will be.And then we also have to create actually our sales and service and distribution system in, I don't know, something in the order of 40 countries, somewhere, it will be over 100 countries. Whereas the other car companies do not own their sales and service and distribution. So they kind of assemble parts from a supplier base and then hand them to a dealer base. So it's just like — it's not just — it's like comparing Tesla to a car company, like just comparing just really one facet or dimension of Tesla, we're like maybe 10% in common with other car companies.Ben Kallo -- Robert W. Baird -- AnalystThank you.OperatorAnd our final question today will come from Philippe Houchois with Jefferies. Please go ahead.Philippe Houchois -- Jefferies -- AnalystYes. Thank you for taking my question. I've got two. The first one for me is try to understand your business model for stationary storage, have your thoughts on it.I mean there are two broad directions for me. One is selling hardware, which is a bit of a cost-plus business. And I'm just wondering if there's an opportunity where Tesla could actually share into the savings that utilities, in particular, could be able to achieve in like grid stabilization. The information I was able to get on your business in Australia a few years ago suggest that given the savings that are achieved, your hardware could have been sold at a higher price.I'm just wondering if you have — can share your views on where the business probably is going.Elon Musk -- Chief Executive OfficerYes, I think you're probably right about that. I mean, RJ and Zach, what do you guys think?RJ Johnson -- Global Head of Commercial EnergyYes. I mean we're already seeing this in Australia, where we're seeing behind-the-meter aggregation that is providing grid services back to the grid, which effectively reduces the price to the customer and reduces the prices for the grid operator. So you're seeing this trend happening across the globe. And it's going to be at the residential level as well as the wholesale level.So Megapack on one end and then Powerwall on the other side. Those two working together in tandem and the software layer on top of it, Autobidder being that, that really is going to help make the grid more efficient using the hardware platform and software together.Drew Baglino -- Senior Vice President, Powertrain and Energy Engineering ; Vice President, TechnologyAnd just a point of clarification, like that the large power plant in — large battery power plant in Australia, like we continue to operate that power plant and generate revenue in the market. So whether we could have sold it for more or less, like we're continuing to make money off of that power plant.Philippe Houchois -- Jefferies -- AnalystOK. And the follow-up question I had was, during the Battery Day, you talked about this cell vehicle integration approach. It's very interesting. And when I look at that, when I think about it, it looks like this means that the skateboard designed that Tesla pioneered and many of your followers are using is going to become obsolete.Or am I not thinking about it the right way?Elon Musk -- Chief Executive OfficerIt will be obsolete long term, yes. I mean — yes.Philippe Houchois -- Jefferies -- AnalystAnd long term, are we talking — yes?Elon Musk -- Chief Executive OfficerI mean several years from now. It's not like existing cars stop having value. It's just that if you have a structural pack, where the pack is contributing structural value to the car because of like the — sort of like the composite honeycomb effect of share transfer between upper and lower plate, then anything that doesn't do that is going to have to have duplicate hardware. It's going to weigh more.It's going to cost more. And then the same goes for the front and rear castings. To be frank, we're trying to make the car like you'd make a toy. If you had a toy model car, how would — and then it's got to be real cheap and look great, how would you make that? You'll cast it.And that's how it's done. It would be absurd to make it up of tiny little pieces of stamp metal joined in complex ways. So it's sort of a natural thing to do. And then the same goes for using the energy storage, the battery as a structure, which is done for aircraft wings and for rockets.The early rockets and aircraft, they had a separate aeroshell from the propellant tanks or fuel tanks, and then they realized that doesn't make sense. And you've got to integrate — you've got to have your fuel tank in wing shape. You've got to have your propellant tanks in the shape of the body of the rocket, for example. You don't want to put a box on a box, basically.So — which over many years made it like basically uncompetitive to have an aircraft that has separate fuel tanks from the wings. The wings need to be fuel tanks. But like I wouldn't think of this as like it's like an overnight transition. It's several years.But then like I said, over time, it just won't be competitive to have a different architecture, in my opinion.Martin Viecha -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsThank you very much. Unfortunately, this is all the time we have for the Q&A today. I appreciate all your great questions, and we'll speak to you again in about three months.

164,"Oct 21, 2020 2:45PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn under a month Workhorse Group (NASDAQ:WKHS) rallied and fell more than 30% twice. How do you invest in a stock this wild? You trade around the short-term price action. WKHS stock is definitely wild but somewhat predictable. It moves fast in both directions but respects the important levels on the charts.It rallied 90% in September into an all-time high, then gave almost of all of it back. It repeated the process again in days, so clearly it’s not for the faint of heart.The problem is in its thesis. Workhorse is part of a group of stocks that burst onto the scene this year through the SPAC processes. The electric vehicle (EV) market caught fire after seeing the success of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). The fundamental changes were so obvious to see that investors wanted back in. Just this week we saw that General Motors (NYSE:GM) brought back the Hummer in an EV “super-truck” format.These new entrants all aim to be the next Tesla. Workhorse is one expecting to do this with electrified trucks. In essence, this is a concept in production not out in the market yet. When there’s nothing tangible then the traders are free to move the price violently.The best thing to do with stocks like this is to trade them based on the charts. They say that “price is truth.” And when there’s the absence of fundamentals, then that’s even more to the point. The charts are the only reliable thing to give traders an edge.In the middle of September I cautioned against chasing WKHS stock into the spike. It was a successful strategy. Although I didn’t catch the absolute top, I did avoid the grief from riding it all the way back down to $20 per share.My message has been consistent that this is a stock that delivers profits if we wait for dips. Momentum traders like to buy high and sell higher, but unless you’re glued to your computer, leave that to the full time pros. Retail investors should aim to find entry points that make sense. Near $20, WKHS stock should have support.This is not a hard line in the sand but a reasonable zone. It has served as a neckline since July. The stock failed there twice and then finally broke out in September. The bears have tested it twice already and from lower highs. Now the overall trading range has tightened into a point at this pivot zone. Normally these are places to buy for a swing trade up. There will be resistance on the way up starting at $24 and $26 per share.The alternative way to trade it is using options. Investors can sell bull put spreads and leave plenty of room for error. The advantage of this method is that it eliminates the need for a rally to profit. The disadvantage is that the maximum profits are capped.Catching a long rally while holding shares is very profitable. But there’s nothing wrong with profiting with no money out of pocket even if the shares fall 20%.The fundamentals on Workhorse do not have actionable statistics yet. The traditional metrics are wonky because it is a startup. This is not a knock against it, but it does make the thesis very speculative. Those by nature need to have very humble conviction. This is the kind of trade that I place tight stops to get me out with minimal damage. This is definitely not an investment where I average down in case the price goes against me.Workhorse has the potential for success. Case in point: Nio (NYSE:NIO). As with all stocks, WKHS will need the help of the macroeconomic conditions. There are outside risks from politicians who are busy making things difficult with the campaign and the stimulus headlines. Moreover, it looks like there are more outbreaks of Covid-19 going into the cold months. Momentum stocks like WKHS stock are susceptible to fast draw-downs if markets trip.On the date of publication, Nicolas Chahine did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.The post Plug Workhorse Stock into Your Trading Portfolio Because It Is Electric appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/plug-workhorse-stock-into-your-trading-portfolio-because-it-is-electric-2020-10-21

165,"Oct 21, 2020 2:28PM EDT","By Sinéad CarewOct 21 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 advanced slightly on Wednesday in volatile trading as investors tracked Washington negotiations for a fresh coronavirus stimulus package and appeared skeptical a deal would be reached before the Nov. 3 U.S. elections.U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were scheduled to talk at 230 PM EDT (1830 GMT) about details of a relief package that Democrats want be in the range of $2.2 trillion. Pelosi, who over the weekend had set a Tuesday deadline for an agreement, said she hoped to resolve the ""appropriations piece"" of the aid bill Wednesday. However, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell does not want to bring a large coronavirus aid bill to the Senate floor before the election, a senior Republican aide said. ""The market's maybe finally realizing it's not happening or if it does happen its going to happen after the election,"" said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Stamford, Connecticut.But investors were taking that prospect in their stride as a pre-election agreement has been in question for some time. ""We're not seeing a lot of panic or fear. Apathy is a good description,"" said O'Rourke. At 2:25 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 0.13 points, or 0%, to 28,308.92, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 5.71 points, or 0.17%, to 3,448.83 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 8.02 points, or 0.07%, to 11,524.51.Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with Energy .SPNY leading the percentage decliners.Instead of plowing money into the market broadly, O' Rourke said investors picked stocks as they looked at results coming out of the third-quarter financial reporting season.Of the major industry sectors communications services .SPLRCL was the biggest gainer, up nearly 2%, after Snapchat messaging app owner Snap Inc SNAP.N beat user growth and revenue forecasts, as more people signed up to chat with friends and family during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results boosted the shares of social media companies Facebook Inc FB.O, up around 5%, and Twitter Inc TWTR.N, up around 8%, helped lift the communications services sector along with a 2.7% rise for Google-parent Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O. Smaller social media firm Pinterest Inc PINS.N was up 8%.Dampening the mood, Netflix Inc NFLX.O was down more than 6% after it kicked off earnings from the Big Tech club. The video streaming service missed expectations for subscriber growth as competition increased and live sports returned to television. Of the 84 S&P 500 firms that have reported third-quarter results, 85.7% have topped expectations for earnings, according to IBES Refinitiv data.After touching a one month high early, Wall Street's fear gauge .VIX edged lower in afternoon trading.Investors were also worried ahead of the elections.Republican President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden will face off in their second and final debate on Thursday night, with Biden leading the race, according to national polls. Indexes changed little after the U.S. central bank's ""Beige Book"" report, a snapshot of the economy gleaned from discussions with business contacts, showed that employment increased in almost all districts, though growth remained slow. Electric-car maker Tesla Inc TSLA.O rose 1.4% as investors geared up for its quarterly report after the closing bell.

166,"Oct 21, 2020 2:14PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith Nio (NYSE:NIO) growing quickly and launching  promising innovations involving batteries, I believe that the company could become highly successful. But given the huge valuation of Nio stock, I would wait for a meaningful pullback of the shares before buying them.Nio appears to have developed high-quality vehicles. But importantly, I have not seen any signs that they are outstanding or that they have captured consumers’ loyalty and imagination the way Tesla’s have. As a result, I believe that it’s still too early to say whether Nio is the next Tesla.As many others have noted, Nio’s orders have been increasing rapidly. In the third quarter, its sales soared 154% year-over-year to 12,206 and in September its deliveries jumped 133% YOY to 4,708.  As of Sept. 30, it had delivered over 26,000 vehicles this year.Meanwhile, I’m very impressed with the company’s battery programs. According to a Seeking Alpha columnist, Nio has  “successfully deployed…battery swapping technology” and “is one of few EV companies” that has done so.  The technology could eventually allow recharging EVs to become as fast and convenient as refueling conventional automobiles are now, the author indicated.And in a related initiative, Nio has launched a battery-as-a-service, or BaaS, program.  Under BaaS, the financial terms of purchasing an EV from Nio are very similar to those of buying a gasoline-powered vehicle. Specifically, the price of Nio’s vehicles drops by $10,000 and consumers pay $145 per month for the battery. That $145 per month fee is reportedly equal to the cost of gasoline for the average commuter in Shanghai, China.Using sales of Nio stock, and large investments by Tencent (OTC:TCEHY) and the Chinese province of Hefei, Nio has solidified its financial position.  When I was extremely bearish on Nio stock earlier this year, I thought that the automaker would not have enough cash to survive. Clearly, I greatly underestimated the extent to which Tencent, Hefei, and Wall Street investors were willing to back Nio.According to J.D. Power, Nio’s vehicles have given their owners, on average, fewer problems than any other EVs available in China, including (by a small margin) Tesla’s vehicles. That’s an impressive achievement.However, the one review of Nio’s vehicles that I was able to find was not totally positive. TopGear wrote that Nio’s ES6 vehicle, its most popular offering,  ” is a heavy thing” and “you can feel that heft in the way the ES6 rides and steers.”  The website also cited “loose body control that sees it bounce its way along somewhat inelegantly.”On the positive side, TopGear was very upbeat on the vehicle’s powertrain, acceleration and interior. It concluded that “The Nio ES6 is a good car..{and} shows  a lot of promise for Nio’s future.”  But it added that the vehicle is “not quite there yet” and “In many respects it’s on par with competition from Europe.”Nio’s vehicles likely have what it takes to remain competitive in the Chinese EV market, especially since they are meaningfully cheaper than those of Tesla. Additionally, many consumers and businesses are likely to be drawn to Nio’s vehicles by the company’s battery programs.Still,  Nio is trading at a market capitalization of $34 billion, versus Honda’s (NYSE:HMC) market capitalization of $42 billion. For Nio to justify its current valuation, it will likely have to improve its vehicles and rise  to the top of the highly competitive Chinese EV market.Since the latter feat will be tough to accomplish, I don’t think the risk-reward ratio of Nio stock is positive at these prices. Moreover, I believe that many high-flying stocks, including Nio, will likely slump again as they did at the beginning of September.Consequently, I would advise investors to wait until Nio slumps to the $18-$20 range before buying its shares.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. Larry has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 13 years.

168,"Oct 21, 2020 1:53PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis year, it may feel as though everything tied to special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) is hot. The reality is, some SPAC IPOs are proving controversial and difficult places for investors to allocate capital.Year-to-date, there have been 127 SPAC IPOs raising a combined $48.5 billion in proceeds. Also known as blank-check companies, SPACs provide a more efficient avenue for firms to go public. The phenomenon has brought well-known growth companies such as DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) and Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE), among many others, to market.However, history confirms that many SPAC IPOs don’t deliver returns on par with comparable companies that went public the traditional route. Additionally, not all SPACs find a company to partner with, meaning the blank-check firm, if it doesn’t accomplish that goal within two years, is vulnerable to liquidation.Here, we’ll examine some companies born of out mergers with SPACs that could be in for downside and some pre-deal blank entities that could be staring at imminent liquidation.Nikola’s year-to-date gain of more than 120% is one of the more deceiving statistics investors will encounter. In terms of price action, what investors should focus on is that this aspiring electric vehicle maker was once a $94 name. It closed at $19.56 last Friday on the back of a 16.12% loss.“Aspiring” is very much the issue with Nikola. Unlike a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) or Nio (NYSE:NIO), Nikola currently doesn’t have a product on the market, meaning its revenue is scant and it makes no money. That’s the type of scenario short sellers sink their teeth into. At least one well-known research firm is making a related case.Last month, Hindenburg Research published a report highlighting possible issues with Nikola technology, saying executives may be overstating battery capabilities while refusing to walk back those audacious claims.These days, NKLA stock is highly dependent on a deal with General Motors (NYSE:GM) that may or may not come to fruition. It may not go to $0, but more downside could be in the offing for Nikola.Hyliion’s situation is remarkably similar to that of Nikola. Both companies are SPAC IPOs and both are would-be manufacturers of electric trucks. More importantly, the stocks share the ominous decline trait. In the case of Hyliion stock, it flirted with $59 in late August before closing at $27 last Friday.Moreover, Hyliion is making audacious claims about its battery technologies. So bombastic are these claims in the eyes of short seller Bonitas Research that the firm says Hyliion’s fuel efficiency claims are lies.“Evidence revealed that Hyliion’s proprietary battery management system technology was purchased for under US$ 1 million, equal to less than US$ 0.01 per Hyliion share!,” according to Bonitas. “There is not one scientific paper or submission that would back up Founder & CEO Thomas Healy’s 30% fuel efficiency claim.”It’s not that Leisure Acquisition is a bad SPAC. The issue here is time. As noted above, blank-check firms have two years to find a merger partner or face liquidation, and the clock is ticking on this SPAC. Its completion deadline is Dec. 1. Anything is possible, particularly with LACQ targeting gaming and leisure names – industries flush with SPAC IPOs this year.What makes Leisure Acquisition’s situation unique is that it had a deal in place to merge with Canadian casino operator Gateway Casinos. However, that $1.15 billion transaction fell apart a few months ago and it’s not yet clear what either party’s next move is.One thing is clear: Given the multiples markets assign to online gaming companies, if Leisure Acquisition can find a partner in that space over the next few weeks, LACQ stock would likely surge.Tuscan Holdings is in the same boat as Leisure Acquisition. It’s not necessarily a “bad” SPAC, but it is facing a time crunch with a looming Dec. 6 completion deadline.The other similarity between these two blank-check firms is that Tuscan is shopping for deals in an arena that should be fertile territory for SPAC transactions, that being the cannabis industry. At the end of the second quarter, Tuscan had $282 million in cash, giving it the ammunition with which to strike a deal that could be valued at $1 billion or more.The time is right for cannabis SPACs to find merger partners because more states could legalize marijuana on Election Day, a Biden Administration could be a boon for the industry, and the idea of recreational cannabis is gaining more bipartisan support. Tuscan just needs to act quickly to capitalize on these tailwinds.The good news is that Spartan Energy Acquisition has a deal in place as its slated to bring EV maker Fisker public. That puts the blank-check company ahead of some of the other names highlighted here. While I’m loathe to say this is a SPAC on its way to $0, I have reservations based on the fact that the EV space is getting crowded quickly and not each new company is going to be the second coming of Tesla.Speaking of Fisker competition, Tesla and others have a massive head start on the company because it’s going to be another two years before Fisker even commences production.Another reason for caution with SPAQ is that Fisker previously existed and ultimately failed due in part to six-figure pricing on its Karma, which limited the audience. Fortunately, the company appears to have learned its lesson as its California, a smaller SUV, is priced from $37,499.Bottom line is this isn’t the worst of SPAC IPOs, but it probably won’t be the best, either.On the date of publication, Todd Shriber owned shares of DKNG.Todd Shriber has been an InvestorPlace contributor since 2014.

170,"Oct 21, 2020 12:55PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInvestors that missed the nearly 20-fold return in Nio (NYSE:NIO) still have a chance. Nio stock rose 32.65% last week as markets continued to digest the strong Sept. and third-quarter delivery numbers.If chances are low that Nio shares will break its uptrend that began in June, investors should continue accumulating the stock.Nio posted strong September delivery figures. The 4,708 deliveries, up 133.2% from last year, is a record for Nio. The mix consisted of 3,210 ES6s, its 5-seater premium, and 1,482 ES8s, the 6-seater, and then 7-seater SUV. For the third quarter, Nio delivered 12,206 vehicles, up 154.3% from last year.The strong growth is in stark contrast to the dark days when investors speculated that it would file for bankruptcy. Earlier this year, China locked down its economy to prevent a further spread of the coronavirus. Since then, Nio attracted investments and sold shares to raise cash. Its stock chart is up since then.When it comes to investing in China-based companies, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) come to mind first. Now, with Nio reporting another record monthly record of deliveries, the electric vehicle firm is a must-own company. Conservative investors may wait for shares to consolidate back to the 50-day moving average in the low $20s. But since Nio does not report quarterly earnings until next month, markets have no reason to take profits.Analysts do not expect Nio to post a profit. Value investors will shy away from investing in the EV firm until after it does so. The risk is that when that eventually happens, the stock may keep rising and could trade $40 to $50 next. At a market cap of $38.7 billion, Nio is worth more than 10 times less than that of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Either Tesla’s market capitalization of $402 billion will have to fall or Nio’s will have to keep rising.Re-emerging tensions between the U.S. and China may scare investors away from China-based companies. Still, Nio’s prospects depend on China’s growing economic strength. It would not get affected by any trade restrictions the U.S. imposes on the region.Valuations are not yet meaningful until Nio starts posting operating profits.In September, competitor XPeng (NYSE:XPEV) posted a 145% year-on-year increase in EV deliveries, to 3,478. For the third quarter, it delivered 8,578 Smart EVs. This is made of 6,210 P7s and 2,368 G3s. CEO He Xiaopeng said, “We are pleased to have achieved a record month of deliveries, which demonstrates our ability to execute our strategy, accelerate sales of our Smart EVs and expand our service and charging network.”XPeng is a potential competitive threat to Nio. After Tesla cut prices of the Model 3 in China, XPeng may do the same, forcing Nio to lower prices, too. That would delay Nio’s path to profitability.In a 5-year Discounted Cash Flow Growth exit model, assume the following metrics:Model courtesy of finboxNio is worth around $35 if investors assume a discount rate of close to 9%.

171,"Oct 21, 2020 12:52PM EDT","By Edward TaylorFRANKFURT, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O Chief Executive Elon Musk on Tuesday evening tweeted that the electric car maker will be rolling out a new version of its Full Self Driving software, the latest attempt by the California-based company to tout autonomous driving.Tesla's ""Full Self Driving"" software would be an important source of revenue, once it is fully deployed. Tesla owners have paid $8,000 up front in hopes of eventually receiving the upgrade. In the second quarter alone, Tesla recognized $48 million of FSD deferred revenue. Tesla reports third-quarter results after the New York market closes on Wednesday. WHAT DOES 'SELF-DRIVING' MEAN?The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) and most automakers define five levels of automation: Levels 0 to 2 include features such as automated braking systems (ABS) and lane departure warnings that need to be supervised by a driver. Liability for vehicle behaviour rests with the vehicle owner rather than the manufacturer.Several automakers say they are ready to deploy Level 3 systems that automate highway driving, but require drivers to remain ready to take control.   IS TESLA CAPABLE OF AUTONOMOUS DRIVING ANYWHERE?No. Tesla has said its system is only capable of functioning on highways.Tesla's Autopilot has been criticized by the National Transportation Safety Board for allowing drivers to turn their attention from the road, leading to deadly accidents.European crash test officials at European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP) gave Tesla's Model 3 a ""moderate"" rating and said the name Autopilot is inappropriate since it suggests full automation. German courts have banned Tesla from repeating misleading claims about the car's self-driving capabilities.  The United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which awarded Tesla the highest safety score for occupant safety, has investigated 15 crashes since 2016 involving Tesla vehicles equipped with Autopilot. In April 2019, Musk said fleets of self-driving robotaxis would be on roads by 2020.On Sept. 22, 2020, during the company's ""Battery Day"" presentation, Musk admitted that Autopilot software was undergoing a ""fundamental rewrite.""Tesla uses eight cameras, radar and ultrasonic sensors to enable its vehicles to navigate streets. It opted against using Lidar, a sensor that Audi and Mercedes say is vital to corroborate information gathered by cameras. ""Anyone who is relying on Lidar is doomed. Doomed,” Musk said last year.Technology to automate highway driving, parking and navigation in stop-and-go traffic is being deployed in an absence of industry-wide standards.Article 8 of the 1968 Convention on Road Traffic states: “Every driver shall at all times be able to control his vehicle or to guide his animals.”Lawmakers across the globe have worked to incorporate a little-noticed amendment to the United Nations Convention on Road Traffic agreed in 2014, into national rules. This would let drivers take their hands off the wheel of self-driving cars.The U.S. states of Nevada and Arizona passed laws to allow test drives of autonomous vehicles there. Alphabet Inc's  GOOGL.O Google tested a car in Nevada in 2012 and in October said it will start offering rides to the public in robotaxi minivans in Phoenix. California also allows limited testing of driverless autonomous vehicles. Mercedes-Benz is now getting ready to launch a Level 3 system in Germany next year, once German law allows drivers to take their hands off the wheel for extended periods of time.BREAKINGVIEWS-The world can safely love the Tesla bubblePREVIEW-Can Tesla hit 2020 delivery goal?

172,"Oct 21, 2020 11:44AM EDT","General Motors (NYSE: GM) unveiled its much-anticipated electric Hummer truck last night — and said that the first year's production of the battery-powered ""supertruck"" is already sold out.Production of the Hummer — officially, the GMC Hummer EV — will begin in the fall of 2021 and will gradually ramp up over the following two years. Only the $112,000 top-of-the-line model, called the Edition 1, will be available in the first year. Other, less expensive models will follow in 2022 and 2023, the company announced.GM opened online reservations for the Hummer on Tuesday night. The Edition 1 sold out in about an hour; other versions were still available as of Wednesday morning.GM's new Hummer EV has lines reminiscent of its brawny predecessors. But unlike those gas-guzzlers, this new Hummer is 100% electric. Image source: General Motors. The Hummer EV Edition 1 is clearly aimed to compete with upcoming rivals, including a premium electric pickup from Michigan-based start-up Rivian and Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) much-hyped Cybertruck. The Edition 1 will generate 1,000 horsepower from a three-motor drivetrain with a zero-to-60 time of about 3 seconds and estimated range of at least 350 miles, GM said. It'll be capable of 800-volt DC Fast charging at up to 350 kilowatts, enough to add nearly 100 miles of range in 10 minutes. All versions of the Hummer EV will be powered by GM's new Ultium batteries and its proprietary Ultium Drive motor units. All but the lowest-level model, due in the fall of 2023, will have the 800-volt DC Fast charging capability, said the automaker.10 stocks we like better than General MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.See the 10 stocksStock Advisor returns as of 2/1/20This video was recorded on October 16, 2020.Chris Hill: We've got the latest headlines from Wall Street, we will dig into how technology is shaping our lives, and as always, we've got a couple of stocks on our radar, but we begin with the biggest public company in America.This week, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) unveiled four new versions of the iPhone 12, including the Mini, the Pro, and the Pro Max. CEO Tim Cook called it the beginning of a new era, and 5G was mentioned [laughs] constantly throughout this presentation, Ron. What stood out to you?Ron Gross: [laughs] Well, I'm going to leave 5G to Jason, because I think it's a little bit more hype than reality right now. We need a nationwide rollout before that becomes exciting. I thought the Mini was interesting. I think it's going to be well-received, at 5.4 inches, a starting price point of $699. I find it fascinating and I really mean this. How every few years, consumers decide to upsize or downsize depending what happens to be the current trend. And so, I kind of think it is smart for Apple to go in that direction, because I think there's going to be a pretty strong demand for this.These events are essential to Apple. Apple needs to continue to innovate and continue to put up those incredible revenue numbers, and therefore, cashflow. So, it's not necessarily these events, but it's the need to be innovative. And these events, let's face it, have become somewhat of a tradition, all the way going back to the excitement that Steve Jobs used to create around these. The stock never does much around these announcements, in fact, I think the stock tends to sell off more than go up on typical days like this, but it's the innovation that's important.We saw some other things, a HomePod Mini, which while I think it looks interesting, I think it's their way to kind of catch up in the smart speaker space, which I think they've kind of been left behind to a certain extent. A couple of other interesting things of note, EarPods and power adapters are no longer going to be included with the phones that you purchase, which is a bummer for consumers, it's probably a decent margin boost for Apple itself. But that's offset by, I think, some of the components in these new phones that are kind of pricey, so we might not directly see an impact to margins there.A few things that people were hoping to see that we didn't, so maybe we have some announcements coming later in the year, AirPods Studio, which is the over-the-head headphones speakers, a cheaper version of Apple TV has been talked about, and finally, there's a silicon-powered Mac that is on the horizon, but we haven't seen that quite yet.Hill: Jason, we saw Verizon CEO, Hans Vestberg, joining Tim Cook on stage. To Ron's point, how much should we make out of all the talk around 5G?Jason Moser: So, 5G to me is compelling, yet I think the consumer implications are going to be still a ways out. It's not going to be like hitting a switch, I think a lot of people -- you know, the financial media is having a field day with it, I think advertisers are having a field day with it, and therefore consumers feel like, oh, 5G is here, boom! Everything has changed. It's not going to be that way. This is going to be a slow rollout, we need to build out the infrastructure, but it's one step at a time. We need to get the capable devices out there, so it's nice to see Apple rolling out those 5G capable devices. Again, you know, it takes two to tango, as they say, Chris, you need the devices and you also need the infrastructure; the infrastructure is still being built.Gross: Jason, speaking of two to tango, is it fair to say that this could be interesting for Chinese consumers, people based in China, since the 5G network is more sophisticated there or am I off base here?Moser: No, I don't think you're off base at all. Certainly, the Chinese market is one that is a little bit ahead of us in regard to the 5G market and its capabilities. I think with Apple, it's just a matter of how they're able to continue getting those devices out there at the price points that they want to maintain, to kind of keep that, you know, that sort of luxury brand that they command, you know?Hill: Shares of Fastly (NYSE: FSLY) are down 30% this week. The edge cloud platform cut revenue guidance for the current quarter because of a reduction in business from its largest customer. And Jason, when you're an unprofitable company, people focus on revenue, and when you come out [laughs] and tell them that revenue is going to be lower, we see stuff like this.Moser: Yeah, I mean, this seems totally right. In fact, I'd argue it should have sold off more. Mind you, that's not a condemnation of the business, it's just one of those hyper growth stocks that's being getting a lot of attention. As you noted, it's not profitable, it's not cash flow positive, it's not the only game in town and it trades for 40X sales after the sell-off. So, I mean, this is just not a buy at any price business.With that said, Fastly, for those who don't know what it does, it's a Content Delivery Network, essentially a CDN, it lives on the edge, literally, it's playing in that edge computing market, it's about getting stuff to us more quickly and more securely. They did offer preliminary results this week, and that was the disappointment. They expect third quarter revenue to total somewhere between $70 million and $71 million versus the guidance that they set of $73.5 million to $75.5 million. And so, anytime you see a hyper growth company pull back on guidance like that, yeah, that's really, really concerning. I don't know that it's a long-term concern necessarily, but you do need to keep in mind, as you mentioned, its top customer ByteDance, which is the Chinese firm that owns TikTok, you know, that's responsible for about 12% to 13% of the company's total revenue. They didn't spend as much as expected. It remains to be seen if that's a blip or a trend, but regardless, this is one of those companies, you have to take the good with the bad when you're investing in these types of businesses.Hill: United Airlines' (NASDAQ: UAL) third quarter loss was bigger than expected, and the CEO said he does not expect flying levels to get back to normal until 2024. Ron, go in any direction you want, you can certainly dig into the numbers, I'm still focused [laughs] on the fact that the CEO of a major airline says we are four years out.Gross: Yeah, I think the comments here are more important than the actual numbers. And these results are, kind of, a metaphor for really the entire industry. I don't think air travel demand gets back to anywhere near normal until a vaccine comes about sometime, let's hope next year or in the first half of next year, if we keep our fingers crossed. But the comments are interesting, because they're indicating that the worse actually may be over, and bookings are returning slowly, but it's that business demand that they're saying it's going to take a while and maybe as far as 2024, what you said is, that's a ways out, but they are doing whatever they can do now.So, for United example, they reduced their cash burn to $25 million/day. [laughs] Now, let me repeat that, $25 million/day cash burn. But that is down from $40 million/day in the previous quarter. Scott Kirby, CEO of United, thinks that they will be cash flow positive sometime next year; I'm happy to see that. His quote is, we've got 12 to 15 months of pain, sacrifice, and difficulty ahead, but increasingly, the light at the end of the tunnel is visible. Clearly, additional government stimulus would be nice; so far it has not happened, but all of these companies have managed to shore up their balance sheets pretty nicely by taking advantage of the first stimulus program doing creative things like mortgaging their frequent flyer programs, mortgaging their planes, raising capital. So, I think we might be in a significantly better situation from a liquidity standpoint versus where we thought we maybe were in April and May.So, this is going to take a while. Hopefully, these folks are going to survive. Lots of layoffs. 13,000 furloughs at United; we feel the pain for those folks for sure, but hopefully, sometime next year this starts to get better.Hill: Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) Prime Day event appears to have gone off without a hitch, and the company announced, during the two-day Prime Day period $3.5 billion in sales for third-party sellers. And Jason, I was struck by that, because in the past we've seen Amazon announce, sort of, total sales, it really feels like they're making a concerted effort, in part with their marketing and their paid advertising, to really push the idea that it's not just this tech behemoth, it's also a platform for small businesses and third-party sellers.Moser: Oh, yeah, absolutely, and I do like that focus. I like them getting that message out there, because in this world, where big tech is really under the microscope, that's their opportunity to really prove their relevance in the overall economy. You know, personally, I've always been a little bit confused by Prime Day. I've never felt all that compelled by the offerings. I mean, much like death, taxes, and people, though, I mean, people just want more stuff. [laughs] And so, Amazon is there to scratch that itch. And as a shareholder, I applaud the effort and I want them to keep on doing it.To your point about third-party sellers, you noted the $3.5 billion in sales. That was up 60% from a year ago. And if you go back a couple of years and you look at Jeff Bezos's letter to shareholders, he noted the chronology there, the timeline of how third-party sellers have continued to take up more share of that platform. And so today, third-party sales make up about 60% of the physical gross merchandise sales on an annual basis. So, you can take those numbers and then you can make some guesses as to how Prime Day may have done overall, but anyway you cut it, I would say it was another success.And again, I do love to see them focusing on that small- to medium-size business message, because that really, really is important, particularly now.Hill: Third quarter profits for Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG) came in higher than expected, but procedures involving the company's da Vinci surgical robot system still are not back to pre-COVID levels, Jason.Moser: No, they aren't. All things considered, I think this business is weathering the current situation quite well. And while it's primarily a U.S.-centric business from a revenue perspective, still we're seeing the benefits of its global reach. Procedures were up 7% from a year ago; particular strength this quarter in China. They are seeing a lot of diagnostic procedures, things like colonoscopies, for example, those are still being delayed. And that is the point of weakness there.And speaking of the procedure growth, if you go back to just March of this year, we were talking about on the show, global procedure growth was 19%, so you can see -- that was a considerable drop-off from earlier in the year. This is all leading to weaker demand, and it's certainly playing out in the third quarter, likely even further out. They are seeing weaker demand in actual capital requests as well. I mean, they installed 195 new systems for the quarter; that's compared to 275 installs from a year ago, 178 installs just a quarter ago.You know, it's not all doom-and-gloom, I mean, this is a stock that's done very well for the year, all things considered, just up around 25%, it's a leader in the space, they continue to innovate. The headwinds are certainly understandable. And if we view those headwinds as temporary, which I do, then I think this is a business that will be poised for success, to resume the growth that it's witnessed to this point once we get past this pandemic.Hill: Shares of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) down a bit this week, despite the fact the third quarter profits and revenue came in higher than expected. Ron, is this about Johnson & Johnson's valuation? I mean, this was a really good quarter they put up.Gross: Yeah, I think the quarter was solid, we'll get to some of the numbers; they didn't, like, knock the cover off the ball, but certainly solid. But I think eyes are mostly on the potential for a vaccine, as they are with many of these similar companies. Hitting some of the numbers, revenues are up 1.7%. So, I mean, you know, nothing to write home about, but you did see strength in consumer products and pharmaceuticals. Now, interestingly, jiving with what Jason just said about Intuitive Surgical, there was weakness in the medical device unit, as people put off elective surgeries. And certainly, we think that will come back and this unit will once again put up some positive numbers. Adjusted earnings per share up 3.8%, still solid fine, not gangbusters, though.Bigger news out of the week for Johnson & Johnson is that they paused the clinical trial of their experimental coronavirus vaccine because of an unexplained illness in one of the volunteers. As I think we've seen over the last month or two, this type of thing is a normal part of the Phase III process or a clinical process in general, but they need to be taken seriously, they need to be investigated, because we obviously have to feel secure about the vaccines that are eventually coming to the public. This week, Eli Lilly, for example, paused the trial for a potential therapeutic due to safety concerns. So, we've got to let the science dictate where these companies go, but for now Johnson & Johnson is on firm footing and we'll keep an eye on the vaccine news.Hill: And again, and still paying that dividend, and one of the few companies, during the pandemic, that actually bumped it up.Gross: You got it. Yep, for sure.Hill: Earlier this week, Disney (NYSE: DIS) CEO Bob Chapek, announced a reorganization with the goal of prioritizing Disney's streaming video business. Jason, there's going to be three content groups, one for sports, one for general entertainment, one for movies. And Chapek has made it very clear, he is focused on putting the customer first.Moser: We have to love leadership when that's their North Star, focusing really on what the consumer wants, that tells you everything you really need to know, in my mind. But this really is the opportunity for Disney to become one of the ultimate direct-to-consumer businesses. I mean, they already are super direct-to-consumer in so many ways, right, with the parks and whatnot. So, I like the move, I like the focus. Streaming, we know is not some kind of fad, I mean, this is the new model for distribution. So, making those investments accordingly makes sense.We talk a lot about the blueprints that other businesses have left out there that others can go by. So, the company that comes to mind immediately is Netflix. When you look at Disney versus Netflix; and Disney has 3X the revenue of Netflix, normally it's far more profitable, it's got multiple revenue streams, complementary businesses. So, why does the market value Netflix more highly than Disney? That's, I think, a very fair question.And you just look at what can Disney emulate there? I think that by nature it's going to be a little bit more of a complicated offering in the sense that it has Hulu, and ESPN, and Disney+, but they also have more IP, they have the potential to deliver far better, more compelling content on a more sustainable basis. So, I think looking at a lot of the things that Netflix has done to date will be wise. I mean, you talk about the innovators and then the imitators, and I think Disney could imitate in certain ways here. To me, I think there's a tremendous opportunity, and we already know how successful the remainder of the business can be in normal times, and we'll get back to somewhat normal times eventually.Hill: You know, Jason, last week we started the show by talking about the entertainment industry. And one of the things we talked about was the dire straits that movie theaters are in. If you're AMC Entertainment, if you're [laughs] Cinemark and you're hearing these comments from Bob Chapek, you got to be concerned, right?Moser: Oh, yeah, I mean, these businesses are already out there talking about the threat of running out of capital by year's end if things don't change. We're already seeing consumer behavior changing in the way that we consume content, there are more substitutes out there than ever before for our entertainment dollars. And I think the longer that this drags on, the more difficult it's going to be for those theaters to really convince consumers that they need to come back, because we're going to see, you know, like they say, there's more than one way to skin a cat, so to speak.Gross: I do think I applaud Disney's move here; I think it's out of necessity the right thing to do, but it's not a slam dunk here. There's a lot of revenue that they're going to need to replace as they, kind of, restructure and focus on streaming. And so, not only do you need to increase your member base of Disney+, but you need to play with pricing and see how much pricing power you have now and over the years, because there's a lot of revenue on that topline that's probably going to go away and needs to be replaced.Hill: Last month, Coca-Cola announced plans to cut the number of brands that it has in half, and this week we learned that one of the brands being cut is Tab, the iconic diet Cola first launched in 1963, rose to prominence and then started to fade in the early 1980s with the arrival of Diet Coke. It's the end of an era, guys; I mean, who doesn't remember Tab?Gross: Man, you come for the pink can, but you stay for the unpleasant aftertaste. I mean, that's a business model right there. Smart move by Coke, they've got to stream down their offerings for sure.Hill: I'm amazed at how long they kept this going, because you go back 20 years and the market share for Tab had plummeted to almost zero, but apparently, Jason, the people who love Tab are pretty passionate.Moser: They are. And I do understand that to an extent. I mean, nostalgia is very powerful. If there was a book made from this, perhaps it could be farewell Tab, we hardly knew you: the ultimate story of disruption, because really Coca-Cola kind of disrupted themselves here, right?Hill: All right, guys, we'll see you later in the show. Up next, a conversation with Jim Steyer, the Founder and CEO of Common Sense Media.Common Sense Media is a nonprofit organization that provides education and advocacy to families to promote safe technology and media for kids. CEO Jim Steyer started Common Sense Media nearly 20 years ago. Recently, he talked with Motley Fool host Dylan Lewis about his new book on the ways in which technology shapes our lives. They also talked about the potential for new regulatory standards for tech companies. Here, Dylan gets the conversation started by talking about the current environment for social media.[...]Dylan Lewis: It does feel like we're having a bit of a moment when it comes to the awareness around these issues and around these platforms. I mean, just thinking back over the last year or so, there's the Netflix documentary, The Social Dilemma that came out ...Jim Steyer: Which we were part of and helped make, right?Lewis: And that's a cultural phenomenon. That created a lot of conversations online. The Great Hack came out in 2019. Do you think that the tides are turning a little bit on this?Steyer: Definitely. And by the way, we were part of both of them, so we know the guys who -- The Social Dilemma was filmed, we did a bunch of the events with Tristan Harris, one of the guys who's in the film. We gave him office space and he worked out of our offices. And we worked with the guys who made the film. Because we thought it was important to talk about the attention economy and the arms race for attention, and the fact that there was manipulative design, particularly aimed at kids, by the way, but at all people. And we worked with the guys in that movie, Roger McNamee, who went to high school with me and my brother, Tristan, Sandy Parakilas, all the people, they are all colleagues of ours. It's a small group of people, quite frankly. And then we know The Great Hack people very well, I did a bunch of things.But what happened was, I would say, eight years ago, we were sort of lone voices in the wilderness, Dylan, right? And it's interesting, because I'm a luddite, I can barely turn on my computer. But I get the basics and our organization, Common Sense, gets the basics of what it can do to kids, particularly their social, emotional, and cognitive development. I'm assuming you're not a parent, or you would have said you are ...Lewis: Not yet [laughs] ...Steyer: But here's the deal, what had really energized me about it was, I could see the impact on my kids, particularly my daughters when they were preteens and teens and all the body image stuff, and all the comparative stuff on Facebook and Instagram and Snapchat, it's really unhealthy, right? So, you can see that as a parent. And what happened was, we realized there were no regulatory structure, because I was running the biggest child advocacy group in the United States; this is what I do for a living. And my brother is pretty smart about politics. You go look who's on the Board, look who my friends are, we know the people in Washington, Sacramento, elsewhere. We finally said, fine, we're going to write some laws.And what's happened is, you could start to see the tide turn, I'd say in 2016-2017, and then you really saw things happen in 2018, when Cambridge Analytica happened. And that's when we decided to write the California Consumer Privacy Act, which is just the law of the land, because effectively, by passing that law in California and GDPR passed in Europe at that time, that's the European privacy law, we regulated privacy on behalf of you and everybody in the audience today, and you should thank us and send us contributions. But we did ...Lewis: Well, on behalf of the audience I'll thank you right now, thank you for doing that.Steyer: But you can feel, absolutely you've seen a sea change. Because in those days they glorified all the tech executives, they basically put them up on a pedestal, and this was the engine of our economy, which it is, you guys are a business show, and they're driving untold successful financially and in stock market prices, but there are huge consequences from what some of the companies have done with absolutely unchecked power and nobody regulating them. And Common Sense has led the way, and I'm proud of that.And by the way, the momentum is completely on our side. And wait 'till you see 2021, because in 2021, man, we are going to really step up what we're going to -- we're going to have a really major regulatory framework on multiple issues. And the book is a precursor for that.The reason I wrote the book, I'm shameless putting it up ...Lewis: You have to plug it.Steyer: I do. I got to plug, Which Side of History? comes out next week. But it's a campaign for us, it's not really a book. So, it's 50 people, and it's everybody from Marc Benioff, to Sacha Baron Cohen, to Mike Bloomberg, to Khaled Hosseini, to Michelle Alexander, to you name it, I got really smart people to write about the impact of tech on society. But the truth is, for me it's a campaign and for our organization it's a campaign, because I think it's a fair question to say to Sundar or to Pichai, or Mark Zuckerberg, or Jeff Bezos, or even Brian Roberts and Jeff Shell at Comcast or any of the big media and tech players, which side of history do you want to be on? I'd like to ask that to most politicians today as well, because to me, as a citizen, we are in a crisis moment in our democracy and tech has played a role in that. That's why I wrote about democracy, even though Common Sense is largely a kids and family organization.Lewis: Since you mentioned the book, and I was absolutely shocked with the roundtable of names that you had as contributors for this thing, you listed off a bunch earlier, but is there anyone that really surprised you with their take on the tech industry or anyone that really introduced something new to the conversation that you hadn't thought about?Steyer: So, I actually think -- so there's a Harvard Business School Professor, Shoshana Zuboff, who wrote a book called Surveillance Capitalism, [The Age of Surveillance Capitalism] which I think is the definitive work. And everyone who watches Motley Fool and who knows Motley Fool ought to read her stuff. I took a piece of that, I had her do a very short synopsis based on her book for it. I think that some of the stuff -- I actually think Mike Bloomberg wrote a really interesting piece about how climate change could be solved using technology. Bill Gates was going to do a piece about that too actually, and he was great about it, but he's now writing a book about that that's coming out next year and he didn't want to undercut his own book which is coming out next year. I think, for business people, Marc Benoiff, who's my good friend, who's the CEO and Founder of Salesforce.So, Benoiff has a really powerful piece about corporate responsibility among tech executives, Marc has been out there more than anybody else in a lot of ways, and he basically calls Facebook cigarettes and should be treated and regulated like the tobacco industry. So, that's a pretty gutsy thing for the CEO of one of the major tech companies in the world to say, and there's a lot of people writing that. And basically, I asked a lot of my friends to write pieces, and they did, because they realized that tech, whether we like it or not, is everywhere in the lungs.Lewis: So, you were pretty critical of Facebook in the intro of the book too, you said, no company has ever known so much or learned so little in such a short time. And I'm curious, if you had a timeline in front of you, what should have happened with Facebook that didn't happen?Steyer: Well, I think they have been by far the most irresponsible and damaging of all the major tech companies. And that's why we as an organization and I personally have such a complicated [laughs] relationship with the people who started the company, and have for many years. Look, they have, first with Facebook and now with Instagram, because from the kids' standpoint, Instagram is way more -- and WhatsApp are way more important than Facebook, right? So first, we were really concerned about how they were impacting the social, emotional, and cognitive development of children, right, all the comparison culture, the ""like"" culture, all the stuff. If you watch The Social Dilemma, the guy who did the ""Like"" button is on there. You know, he used to work out of our office after he left Facebook.And you know, you realize they've really, really manipulated society in a really bizarre way. And honestly, marks all the mantra back in, like, 2010 about frictionless sharing, and everybody you share all aspects of our lives, what total BS that is, what an absurd philosophy, that makes no sense. And in truth, it was just a monetization, they learned how to basically monetize your personal information, sell it to advertisers, so it's a brilliant business and I give them incredible credit.Lewis: So, as someone who has spent a lot of time thinking about this, if you could, with just a wave of the wand, create the rules, what would they look like for these social media companies?Steyer: Well, No. 1, is I would treat the platforms in the same way we treat broadcast television, cable television and newspapers. I would have standards, and I would actually hold them accountable for what they publish, including user generated content. The user generated content is a little more complicated, you'll have to -- but I would basically hold them accountable and have the same kind of standards we've had for media, in general, because they're the biggest media publishers in the world. They're way bigger than ABC, NBC, etc., right? So, I'd hold them accountable. And I'd have basically the same rules they wrote for all media in the United States.Second, I'd have really strong consumer privacy laws. Third, I would take antitrust action against some of these companies. I would force Facebook to divest itself of Instagram and WhatsApp. I would look very seriously at some of the other big tech companies and have them broken up. I think that would increase competition, actually it'll increase the value of the companies if you broke them up into smaller entities. And then I would also require, I would be really, really look at ways in which the platforms could restore some of the democratic norms that have been undermined in the past few years.So, I think there's a huge really important agenda for the tech industry right now, and that we should pursue it. That's something that those who watch The Motley, who follow The Motley Fool should pursue, because it's in your interest.Lewis: You mentioned before that you're a parent; and I'm not. But I would love to get your advice to the parents that are out there watching on how to navigate social media, how to navigate YouTube, all these different things, with their children and have, what feel like, productive conversations about these things.Steyer: Well, A. conversation is a really good rule, because I think your kids [...] you just have to talk with them about it on a daily basis. I mean, I would say basically, delay, delay, delay in terms of giving your kids cellphones and access. Look, an iPhone is essentially a mini computer in your pocket, why would you give that to an eight-year-old, right? It allows you to have access to anything. So, I would think about several things. One, don't give your kids access to devices and platforms until way later. We've really been strict, we don't let our kids have a phone until they go to high school. And by the way, they whined and cried about it a little bit, they're all fine, and now they're very grateful to mom and dad that we did that.I would say limited time, you know, be very specific about time limits, like, boys love video games. I have two sons, they would play video games eight hours a day if we let them, particularly when they were teenagers, I wouldn't let him do that. I would set time limits. I find that healthy balance is really hard during COVID-19, because kids are in front of a screen way more time, but I'd limit screen time. And then I'd be really careful about the content that they're exposed to. That's why Common Sense is there. We are the people, we're the universal rating system for all content.So, No. 1, I'd delay devices and platforms until you thought your kids were age-appropriated. No matter what other kids in their school are saying and the peer pressure they feel at age 10 to have an iPhone. No. 2, I would limit the amount of time. And No. 3, I'd really regulate the content. And I would have daily conversations, because these kids are digital natives, they grew up with it. I mean, Dylan, you're not a digital native; you're closer to one than I am. And it affects every aspect of their lives, and they need to understand the pros and the cons of technology and the content.[...]Hill: Jim Steyer's new book is Which Side of History?

And, guys, I can't really think of an artful way to say this, so I'm just going to say, this company has built a robot dolphin.The cost for the robot dolphin is somewhere in the neighborhood of $3 million to $5 million. And once you get past the idea that it's a robot dolphin, Ron, the business implications start to get pretty interesting. If you think about theme parks, movies, aquatic research.Gross: Sure. [laughs] So, I'm all in favor of getting dolphins out of captivity. I think I read that maybe there's 3,000 in captivity. And I think it's great if we can set them free. I don't think a robot would replace the experience at a theme park of swimming with a dolphin, you would just probably pass and be like, no, I'm good, I'll just stay dry and I don't need to do that. I do like your comment about movies, television and how we could replace dolphin actors, [laughs] for lack of a better word, with their robot brethren. But I don't know, $3 million to $5 million is pretty expensive. [laughs]Hill: Jason, you sound like you're not a fan.Moser: Well, I mean, I am and I'm not. I do agree with Ron, I like the angle of being able to focus on fewer animals in captivity. I mean, as someone who has swam with the dolphins before, listen, that's a priceless experience. And fortunately for us, the facility that we were able to do that through -- this was about bringing dolphins in that were in trouble, right, helping them recover, and then ultimately setting them free. So, it seemed like it was a better message that they were espousing there.It sure seems like for movies' sake, technology can really take place here and just give us some cool CGI. And in regard to actually going to Sea World, I mean, if you know that you're going to go see robot dolphins and killer whales and what not, I mean, that absolutely takes away from experiences, like, why even bother? So, yeah, I can see both sides of it there.But ultimately, let's just go back to the rise of the machines, Chris, we talk about this all the time. I'm scared of hackable dolphins, right? I mean, this army of dolphins all of a sudden; let's talk about the implications there for a second.Gross: Water and electricity scare me.Moser: [laughs] That's another great point right there.Hill: Yeah. Technically, I think it would be an armada of robot dolphins. Before we get to the stocks on our radar, our email address is Radio@Fool.com. A question from Tyler Winkler. ""If you only had one investment to make today and give to your kids, in 20 years, besides an index fund, what would it be?""Real quick, Ron, let's help Tyler with a couple of investment ideas for 2040.Gross: A very hard question to answer, putting my money where my mouth is, I opened up two Roth IRAs for both my children earlier this year, and I put Microsoft into both of them. I like it as an investment for the next 20 years.Hill: Jason?Moser: Yeah, let's go War on Cash style here. I think you got to look at a company like PayPal and think that is going to be one that is only more relevant 20 years from now.Hill: I'm going to go with a company that is near-and-dear to my heart and taste buds, Starbucks, because drinking coffee in 2040 is going to be exactly the same as it is today. [laughs]Let's get to the stocks on our radar. Our man behind the glass, Dan Boyd, is going to hit you with a question. Jason, you're up first, what are you looking at this week?Moser: Yeah. A new one, I think, to the show here, Visteon (NASDAQ: VC), ticker is VC. And Visteon designs and manufactures automobile cockpit electronics and connected car solutions for vehicle manufacturers worldwide. Main focus is really on audio and infotainment offerings and displays, but for me, I'm actually really interested in its heads-up displays that it's building out. These are displays that use augmented reality to overlay graphics in the driver's line-of-sight to represent objects in the vehicle's path all on the windshield. So, you're going to be able to get information as a driver on the windshield as opposed to having to kind of look around the car. The safety implications are obvious there. It's got a large and diverse customer base, with companies like Ford, and Mazda, General Motors, Volkswagen, Jaguar, Honda, BMW.Ford is its largest customer, but this is a small cap company. Restructuring the business a little bit, which could weigh on the stock in the near-term, but definitely want to dig in into.Hill: Dan, question about Visteon?Dan Boyd: Yes, certainly, Chris. Jason, how much heads-up display is too much heads-up display? Because a lot of these things, they seem like they could be a little distracting.Moser: It could be. And I think, you know, you hear talk of Tesla allowing for streaming video in the car. I think when you're streaming Netflix on your heads-up display, we got a problem.Hill: Ron Gross, what are you looking at this week?Gross: Danny, I'm going back to Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ: BBBY), BBBY. Shares are up almost 100% over the last month, as relatively new CEO, Mark Tritton, formerly of Target, continues to make moves to turn the company around. This week, the company announced it will sell 80 Christmas tree shops. Who knew there were 80 Christmas tree shops, but there are, Dan. And they're going to sell a distribution center for $250 million; that's in addition to lots of shakeups at the executive level, raising money by selling PersonalizationMall to 1-800-Flowers. They're doing a lot of great things to, both, turn the business and shore up the balance sheet. And is still a big short interest here, Dan. So, if they continue to execute, I think those shorts are going to have to cover, sending the stock higher.Hill: Dan, question about Bed Bath & Beyond?Boyd: Certainly, Chris. Ron, I rag on you constantly for your stock picks on the show and today is no [laughs] exception, Bed Bath & Beyond is the boring-est place on the planet and I don't think I've ever gone there willingly. Why did you bring this to me?Gross: Because I want to make you money, Dan, and that's all I'm here to do. You should spend some time in the Beyond section, because I think that's really where you'll shine. [laughs]Hill: Dan, two stocks, you got one you want to add to your watchlist?Boyd: I'll tell you what. Ron, his choice is compelling, because of the way the stock has moved in the last year, but I'm going to go with Visteon, because I'm really quite interested in automotive technology and I'm excited to see where that kind of stuff brings us.Moser: All right.Hill: All right. Jason Moser, Ron Gross, guys, thanks for being here.Gross: Thanks, Chris.Moser: Thank you.Hill: That's going to do it for this week's edition of Motley Fool Money.

175,"Oct 21, 2020 8:08AM EDT","With year-to-date gains of 425%, compared to a 7% rise for the S&P 500 index, it’s safe to say that shares of Tesla (TSLA) has run over every bear standing in the way of the company.Tesla's strong stock surge has been driven by its impressive third quarter delivery totals for its flagship vehicles which not only suggests strong product demand but also solid execution. It appears that unlike rivals Ford (F) and General Motors (GM) which are experiencing halts in production, Tesla has seen little-to-no production impact during the pandemic. But that has not stopped skeptics from becoming even more embolden in their short thesis. This is despite how many times Tesla has proven them wrong.The luxury electric car manufacturer is set to report third quarter fiscal 2020 earnings results after the closing bell Wednesday. The company has beaten analysts’ revenue and profit estimates in each of the past three quarters. And there’s a strong chance another beat is in store. While many pundits continue to insist on relegating the company to just an auto manufacturer, the company’s growth trajectory and its diverse product portfolio, which — aside from electric vehicles — includes batteries, software, solar roof/panels, suggests Tesla is more than a one-trick pony and should be viewed as sustainable energy company.The question is, can Tesla stock continue to drive higher Wednesday? I think this will all depend not only on a the degree of the beat, but also the quality. While the company’s strong sequential jump in deliveries is a positive, it will be interesting to see the impact this had on Tesla’s operating expenses since it implies higher production. Elsewhere, analysts will want more (or additional) color on the company’s battery day which didn’t seem excite investors as some thought it would. Tesla did, however, including its three-year plan to cut some 56% of battery costs.In the three months that ended September, Wall Street expects Tesla to earn 56 cents per share on revenue of $8.26 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to 37 cents per share on revenue of $6.3 billion. For the full year, ending in December, the company is expected to earn $1.75 per share, compared to earnings of 4 cents a year ago, while full-year revenue of $30.14 billion would rise 22.6% year over year.CEO Elon Musk has forecasted for 2020 vehicle deliveries to rise between 30% to 40% on a year-over-year basis. Vehicle deliveries are the closest measure of revenue for Tesla. Tesla delivered 139,300 vehicles in the third quarter, above delivery estimates of around 137,000. The deliveries were out of 145,036 vehicles produced. And the fact that the company continues to exceed its vehicle delivery totals in such robust fashion suggests the Street’s quarterly forecast might be equally too conservative.The company has promised to deliver at least 500,000 vehicles this fiscal year. Analysts will be eager to see if Tesla maintains that guidance. To be sure, the bears are quick to point out that delivery totals doesn’t always equate to profits. While that’s true, Tesla’s management has heighten its focus on profitability and efficiencies in the past three quarters - a trend that should continue to work in Tesla’s favor.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tesla-tsla-3rd-quarter-earnings%3A-what-to-expect-2020-10-21

177,"Oct 21, 2020 6:00AM EDT","By Tina Bellon and Akanksha RanaOct 20 (Reuters) - When Tesla Inc TSLA.O reports results for the third quarter after the bell on Wednesday, it will be the next three months, and whether Chief Executive Elon Musk can achieve the company's ambitious year-end goal, that analysts will be interested in.The electric carmaker has stuck to its forecast of delivering half a million vehicles in 2020 despite a global pandemic and economic upheaval that has sunk most of its internal combustion rivals deep into the red.That means Tesla must deliver more than 181,600 vehicles in the last three months of the year - a 30% increase from record third quarter deliveries of 139,300 vehicles. While several analysts believe that goal is attainable, others see a worsening macroeconomic environment ahead.""I'm ... cautious about demand given the recessionary environment and accelerating pace of coronavirus infections, making it tough for the company to hit its 500K car sales target for the year,"" said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at investing.com.Analysts on average expect Tesla to report net income of $593 million in the third quarter on revenue of $8.4 billion, according to Refinitiv data.Several analysts, including Frank Schwope at Nord/LB, believe the positive numbers are due to regulatory credits - payments Tesla receives from other carmakers to offset their emissions.Tesla Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn said in July the carmaker expected credit revenue in 2020 to double from 2019 levels, but said that cash flow will eventually decline.With recovery in the United States sluggish and Europe struggling with a second bout of the virus outbreak, Tesla analysts had pinned their hopes for growth on China, which has begun to recover as consumers shake off the pandemic's effects. While Tesla does not break out regional sales, data from China's auto industry association CPCA showed Tesla Model 3 sedan sales remained roughly flat from July to September. Overall, Tesla sold a total of around 34,100 Shanghai-made Model 3s in the third quarter.Third-quarter registration data from California, Tesla's largest U.S. market, on Tuesday showed Tesla vehicle registrations dropped 13% compared with last year. Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note they hoped Tesla would provide investors with more details on Wednesday about the Chinese market and which countries compensated for lackluster demand in the world's second-largest economy.Tesla plans to ramp up production over the coming years by expanding output at its Shanghai plant to 250,000 vehicles a year, including its crossover Model Y.It is also building new vehicle and battery factories near Berlin, Germany, and Austin, Texas.(Reporting by Tina Bellon in New York and Akanksha Rana in Bengaluru Editing by Joe White and Sonya Hepinstall)((Tina.Bellon@thomsonreuters.com; +1 646 573 5029; Reuters Messaging: tina.bellon.thomsonreuters@reuters.net; Twitter @TinaBellon))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/preview-can-tesla-hit-2020-delivery-goal-investors-watch-for-musk-steer-2020-10-21

179,"Oct 21, 2020 2:43AM EDT","Investing in the fast-growing electric vehicle market looks tricky at the moment. Pure-play EV stocks have rallied big this year and look overvalued. For instance, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is up 5x this year, while China’s Nio is up over 7x. On the other hand, mainstream automakers who have been slowly transitioning to electric drivetrains could face financial challenges due to the disruption caused by Covid-19. Our indicative theme of Electric Vehicle Component Supplier Stocks – which includes stocks of companies that make EV components and raw materials for batteries – could be a good way to play the growing electric vehicle market, without having to bet on individual brands. The theme is up by about 9% year-to-date, versus the S&P 500 which is up by about 8% over the same period.  While Albemarle (ALB) is the strongest performer in the theme, up by about 30%, BorgWarner (BWA) stock is down by about -10%. Below, is a bit more about these companies and how they’ve fared so far this year.Albemarle (ALB) is the world’s largest producer of lithium for EV batteries. Most electric vehicles are powered by lithium-based batteries and it’s likely that demand for the material will rise as EV adoption grows. The stock is up by about 30% year-to-date.TE Connectivity (TEL) provides a range of products including connector systems, sensors, and relays for a range of industries such as automotive, aerospace, defense, and oil and gas. The company has increasingly been focusing on products for hybrid and electric vehicles. The stock is up by about 14% year-to-date.Amphenol Corporation (APH) sells a range of components used in EVs including charging inlets, charge plugs, various sensors, and power distribution systems. The stock is up by about 7% year-to-date. APHAptiv (APTV) provides a range of solutions for the auto industry, including autonomous driving technologies, safety technologies,  components, and wiring. The stock is up 4% this year.BorgWarner (BWA) is an auto components and parts supplier best known for its manual and automatic transmissions. The company is doubling down on the EV space, producing electric motors, power transmission, and power electronics for electric vehicles.

181,"Oct 21, 2020 2:09AM EDT","Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has become the world’s most valuable automaker by far with a market cap of over $400 billion, as its stock soared by about 5x this year. At current valuations, investors are counting on Tesla to continue robust delivery growth, while eventually posting industry-leading margins driven by higher software sales, improved economies of scale, and lower battery costs. Now, Tesla is mostly delivering on the growth front – deliveries soared by 43% year-over-year in Q3 2020. When the company publishes Q3 results this Wednesday, our focus will be on Tesla’s Operating Margins – which we expect will see considerable improvement, as Revenues continue to scale up with costs largely remaining under control. Below is a bit more on what to expect when the company reports earnings. See our analysis on Tesla Expenses: How Does Tesla Spend Its Money? for a detailed breakdown of Tesla’s costs. Tesla has already published delivery figures for Q3, indicating that deliveries soared by 43% year-over-year to about 139k units in Q3 2020, likely driven by higher sales of Model 3 in China as Tesla scales up production at its Shanghai factory and by sales of the Model Y compact SUV which was launched earlier this year. While Average Selling Prices of Tesla’s vehicles could trend lower year-over-year, due to price adjustments and a higher mix of lower-priced Model 3 and Y sales, Revenues are still likely to trend significantly higher.Now Tesla’s Gross Margins – defined as Revenues less direct costs – should benefit from higher software sales, as Tesla raised the price of its autopilot feature by $1,000 to $8,000 at the beginning of this quarter. Secondly, Tesla is likely to continue benefiting from stronger sales of emission credits. The company’s regulatory credit sales soared 4x in Q2 2020 likely driven by Tesla’s deal to sell about $2 billion in credits over 2020 and 2021 to Fiat Chrysler.Tesla has also been managing its fixed operating costs well. The company’s Selling, General & Administrative expenses have largely averaged about $650 million each quarter while R&D expenses have been trending lower.  With soaring Revenues, the above-mentioned tailwinds for Gross Margins, and solid operating cost controls, Tesla’s Operating Margins should trend higher in Q3. For perspective, Operating Margins expanded from about -3% in Q2 2019 to about 5% in Q2 2020 and we think it’s likely that the metric will see a strong increase this quarter.What if you’re looking for a more balanced portfolio instead? Here’s a high-quality portfolio to beat the market, with over 100% return since 2016, versus 55% for the S&P 500. Comprised of companies with strong revenue growth, healthy profits, lots of cash, and low risk, it has outperformed the broader market year after year, consistently.See all Trefis Price Estimates and Download Trefis Data hereWhat’s behind Trefis?

182,"Oct 20, 2020 5:51PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFor most of the 2010s, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has been one of the market’s most polarizing battleground stocks. But, over the past year, this bull versus bear debate has become increasingly one-sided, as TSLA stock has soared more than 800% on the back of record demand, record deliveries, record revenues and record profits. Have the bulls won?Yes.By now, it should be abundantly clear that Tesla is the future of transportation, for two simple reasons. One, electric vehicles will reach global ubiquity within the next two decades. Two, Tesla is miles ahead of everyone else when it comes to making the best EVs.Still, one could very reasonably argue that Tesla — with a $400 billion market cap that is more than 13X Ford‘s (NYSE:F) market capitalization — is already fully priced to take over the global transportation market.It is.But it’s not fully priced for the company to also take over the global energy market — and make no mistake, Tesla will do just that with its solar panels, Megapack and Powerwall solutions over the next two decades, too.So how big could Tesla get as the world’s most dominant auto and energy company? My numbers say a trillion dollar valuation is likely within the next few years, and that TSLA stock will soar well above $1,000.Needless to say, that means long-term investors should stick with TSLA stock.Here’s a deeper look.There will be no greater disruption in the 2020s than the electrification of automobile transportation.About 64.3 million new passenger cars were sold globally in 2019. Only 2.3 million of them (or 3.5%) were electric, which is up from 97,500 (0.15% penetration) in 2013.Clearly, the shift towards EV has already started. It will only accelerate in the 2020s.Demand is shifting, as over 80% of prospective car buyers today want an EV. Laws are shifting, as California just banned the sale of gas cars post-2035. Technology is improving, with the average range of an EV has increasing by 140% since 2011. Costs are falling, with average EV prices having dropped 70% since 2010. Supply is pivoting, as every auto maker in the world is making an all-out blitz into the EV category.Perhaps most importantly, the need is also only getting bigger. Global warming isn’t going away anytime soon. Gas cars still emit tons of greenhouse gases. We need to reverse that path — and we will, because the economics and technology behind EVs are now good enough to make mass adoption feasible.The future couldn’t be any clearer.EVs are on the cusp of disrupting the multi-trillion-dollar auto market, and over the next two decades, will become globally ubiquitous.In numbers, the global auto market will likely march higher towards 80 million annual sales by 2035, thanks to population growth and urbanization. Given current trends, I think 50% EV penetration globally is totally feasible by then, implying about 40 million EV deliveries by 2035 — up almost 20X from 2019’s base.Tesla will dominate that 40 million EV market, which means nothing but good things for TSLA stock going forward.When it comes to making and selling EVs, Tesla is the best in the game — and there’s no competition.Tesla’s cars are the best performing EVs in the market, mostly thanks to Tesla’s unrivaled lead in EV battery technology (Tesla’s four EV models are also the four longest-range EVs in the market today, while they also feature the fastest recharge times, the most horsepower, the fastest top speeds and the quickest 0-to-60 times).The company is selling those cars at market-low prices (the Model 3 retails for less than $40,000), and will continue to lead in bringing down battery costs, and therefore, bringing down EV retail prices (management is promising a $25,000 EV in the not-too-distant future). Tesla also has unchallenged production capability to meet surging demand (the company has built / is building EV gigafactories in North America, Asia and Europe).Not to mention, the company has the best brand in the auto market, with Tesla’s brand popularity continuing to surge among consumers.All in all, when its comes to making and selling EVs, Tesla is top dog. That’s why the company, by my numbers, controls about 17% of the global EV market today.I suspect Tesla will be able to leverage its technology, production and branding advantages to largely sustain ~15% EV market share for the foreseeable future, despite rising competition (mostly because those competitors can’t really “compete” with Tesla at scale). In an EV market that will measure 40 million deliveries in 2035, that implies 6 million annual deliveries for Tesla.At an average sales prices of $30,000, that implies $180 billion in auto revenues for Tesla by 2030.That’s a big number. But, as stated earlier, it’s really just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to TSLA stock’s long-term growth narrative.Everyone thinks of TSLA as an auto company. It is. But it’s also an energy company. And therefore, just as critical to the TSLA stock bull thesis as the electric vehicle wave, is the broader clean energy wave.Make no mistake. Just as the electric vehicle wave has arrived and will lead to enormous disruption over the next two decades, the clean energy wave has similarly arrived and will enormously disrupt incumbent energy markets over the next two decades — and, yes, Tesla will be at the heart of this disruptive megatrend, too.Back in 2000, renewable energy — like solar, wind and hydroelectric — accounted for just 9% of U.S. electricity generation. That share rose to 17% in 2019, and is on track to eclipse 20% within the next few years. This huge growth has been driven by three things:None of these trends are going to reverse course.Pro-green legislature — like the stuff you are seeing in California — will become the norm across the U.S. over the next few years. Consumers will increasingly demand clean energy sources as they look to combat climate change. And continued technological improvements coupled with increased scale will drive renewables energy costs lower, and lower, and lower.Big picture: The Clean Energy revolution has arrived, and it’s going to dramatically change our world (for the better) over the next decade. By 2035, we will be living in a world powered by solar and wind — and in order to get there, annual solar energy investment needs to grow by 68% to ~$200 billion per year.But the sun doesn’t always shine. And the wind doesn’t always blow. So critical to the mass deployment of solar and wind power over the next two decades will be the mass deployment of advanced battery storage technology to store excess solar and wind power. That’s why the global battery storage market is expected to increase by ~10X from 2019 ($59 billion) to 2035 ($546 billion).So, between solar energy production and battery storage, Tesla’s addressable market for its energy business is marching towards $750+ billion. The company should be able to capture a significant share of that, implying enormous upside potential left for TSLA stock.Tesla has visibility to dominating the clean energy market at scale, much as the company is dominating the electric vehicle market today.On the solar side, there’s really one factor that matters above all else, and that’s cost. On the cost front, Tesla dominates the competition. Tesla Solar is the lowest cost solar in the United States, with solar prices that (post Federal Tax Credit) hover around $1.49 per watt, which is 30% cheaper than the U.S. average.Meanwhile, on the battery storage front, the underlying battery chemistry behind making powerful batteries for electric vehicles is very similar to the chemistry behind making powerful batteries for storage. That’s why Tesla today has market-leading solutions for commercial battery storage (the Megapack) and personal/residential battery storage (the Powerwall). It’s also why Tesla should be able to dominate the battery storage market at scale, because the company will continue to have an unrivaled lead in battery technology.Plus, Tesla has a branding advantage here. The company is already well recognized by consumers as a trusted name in clean energy through its best-in-breed electric vehicles. Given that strong reputation, it’s quite likely that consumers will trust Tesla most when choosing solar panels and/or residential battery storage.Thus, in the long run, Tesla projects as the world’s dominant solar energy and battery storage provider.How much of this combined $750 billion market can Tesla grab by 2030?By my calculations, 25% share seems totally doable, implying $187.5 billion in Tesla Energy revenues by 2035. If Tesla Energy does get that big, then there is huge upside potential in TSLA stock over the next 10 to 15 years.Between its auto and energy businesses, Tesla is a trillion dollar company in the making.The math here is simple.By 2035, revenues will measure somewhere around $400 billion, with $180 billion coming from auto, $187.5 billion coming from energy, and the rest coming from related services. Gross margins should hover above 25%, while the opex rate should fall with scale towards the high single-digit range, implying a company-wide operating margin of ~20%.That implies operating profits of $80 billion. After taking out interest and taxes, that could easily flow into $65 billion in net profits.The market’s historically average forward price-to-earnings ratio is 17. Based on that multiple, Tesla will be worth more than a trillion dollars by the 2030s.Considering Tesla is worth $400 billion today, the investment implication here is clear. TSLA stock should remain a core long-term holding for any and all investors with a multi-year time horizon.Ignore the bears.Tesla stock is a long-term winner. And considering the company’s leadership position in the burgeoning electric vehicle and clean energy markets, TSLA stock is not overvalued today.So, long-term investors should stick with this stock. It represents the market’s most compelling play on the future of transportation and energy.On the date of publication, Luke Lango did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The New Daily 10X Stock Report: 98.7% Accuracy – Gains Up to 466.78%.

185,"Oct 20, 2020 3:23PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTo use a phrase that we’re all too familiar with now, I think it’s time to socially distance from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) — investors shouldn’t get within six feet of TSLA stock.As of its Oct. 20 opening price of $431 per share, Tesla is worth $400 billion on expected sales of around $30 billion. The trailing price to earnings ratio is a staggering 1,080. There’s also no dividend, nor the prospect of one.Tesla is not just worth more than General Motors (NYSE:GM). The company is worth more than GM, Ford (NYSE:F), Fiat Chrysler (NASDAQ:FCAU) and Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) put together.Yet, almost one in five shares are still held short, and more analysts are suggesting you sell it rather than buy. So why did Wedbush recently raise its price target again, this time to $500 a share? In some ways, it seems that Tesla is moving too fast for its own good.Of course, it’s hard to deny the company’s prowess right now. For instance, Tesla beat delivery expectations for the third quarter.China — the market no American company could crack — is also proving to be a gold mine for TSLA stock, Wedbush says. It could soon represent 40% of Tesla sales. Demand there remains robust, with the novel coronavirus pandemic mostly in the rearview mirror. Car sales are surging in general.But instead of just talking about cars, Tesla bulls are now talking about batteries as well. The latest 4680 cell is expected to last 2 million miles. Additionally, Tesla is foraying into solar roofs.Big results are grist for a momentum investor’s mill. Less than a year ago, before its split, Tesla was selling for about $50. If you put $50,000 in then, you now have over $400,000.The company is due to report results Oct. 21, and analysts are expecting revenues of $8.2 billion as well as profits of over 50 cents per share. But there’s a “whisper number” of 82 cents. When whisper numbers are that much higher than analyst estimates, I can’t help but be skeptical.Despite all of the promising numbers, the shorts still do have an argument.Trefis analysts have wagered that TSLA stock could easily fall to $150 per share. The analysis is built on slowing growth and shares hitting a price to earnings ratio of 35. None of these things sound unreasonable.What’s more, as much as Tesla owners love their hyper-modern cars, there are also haters out there. In Sweden, a Tesla store burned recently, destroying seven cars. Arson is suspected. A trend away from conspicuous consumption could hurt the company.Finally, Tesla started squeezing buyers for fatter profits. It has cut its used car warranty and dropped its one-week refund and return policy. Tesla also recently suffered a network outage, leaving customers unable to connect to their cars or re-charge them. Needless to say, all of these things haven’t exactly built good will between Tesla and its consumers.Then there’s the market itself. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) analysts think tech stocks like Tesla may be peaking, soon to be too big for their own good.The most reasonable argument I can find against TSLA stock starts with China.China doesn’t like foreigners eating its markets. The government there has begun subsidizing Chinese car company Nio (NYSE:NIO), and has billions more invested in state-run car plants.Then there’s the numbers game. As numbers grow, the growth gets harder. You can get a 1,000% increase going from sales of 50,000 to 500,000. But to get another 1,000% increase, you must sell 5 million cars. Tesla is now being valued on that basis. There were 17 million vehicles sold in the U.S. last year, total.Of course, I still pity the fool who would short Tesla. But that doesn’t mean I’m buying it.On the date of publication, Dana Blankenhorn did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.Dana Blankenhorn has been a financial journalist since 1978.

186,"Oct 20, 2020 2:47PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis year will go down in history because of what Covid-19 did to humanity. We will also remember how we shut down the world for months. But on Wall Street they will tell stories about how 2020 was the year of the SPAC (Special Acquisitions Corporations). Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp. (NYSE:KCAC) is one that came to light in mid-August. But on Sept. 3, Kensington capital stock soared almost 100% in a flash. The company’s goal was to buy out its way into the EV revolution.The jubilation continued for one more day as KCAC set another record and extend the gains to 150%. Alas, that marked the top and since it has gone downhill fast. So far it gave up 44% but it is still 30% above the Sept. 3 breakout line. That’s a major setback for the bulls especially those that chased the hype too late.How to trade it from here requires speculation on the future of EVs and some technical charting skills.The reason Kensington capital stock spiked was over the news of its merger with QuantumScape. QuantumScape specializes in revolutionizing batteries. That’s going to plug a big need for the EVs that are coming to market.The new union has the backing of powerhouse names like Bill Gates and Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY). Given the recent Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) shenanigans, vetting them is extremely important. Justin Mirro, founder and CEO of KCAC, has the credentials in automotive to lead this thing.Not all EV start ups will be successful but the ones that are will need batteries. KCAC will have the opportunity to serve this budding industry. While Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has created the best challenge against the internal combustion engine (ICE), the effort is still an embryo.In 2019, the world produced over 90 million vehicles. This year it will be fewer due to the interruption from the pandemic. Nevertheless that is a ton of potential because EVs barely make up 3% of the total vehicle sales. There is plenty of business to grab. KCAC has a long runway ahead of it provided they deliver on their promises. The science from QuantumScape will be the ace up their sleeve.I don’t profess to be an expert on the matter but skimming the top line suggests potential. Owning Kensington Capital stock is a pure bet on the future success of this new alliance. Therefore by definition it is a speculative trade so it can’t be massive.I don’t have an edge in the knowledge-base but I can give myself an edge from the charts. That’s where a little bit of technical analysis go a long way. Conviction is scarce when the bet hinges on hopium. Learning a few lines on a chart can help with that.After a 47% fall from grace, KCAC stock found footing at $13.50. This now becomes the line to hold else the chute continues to fill the gap. Conversely, rallies into $17 per share will face resistance. The selling pressure will start near $16. In fact, every ledge on the way down is now resistance on the way up. The mega-spike caused a lot of damage because it broke the normal price patterns that machines like to follow.From here, the bet remains the same as before and that is binary. Investors who like the concept should just buy it for the long term reward. If Kensington is indeed one of the suppliers to the EV industry then they will have a fat reward. The potential addressable market is so huge that there will be business to go around for all.Tesla is succeeding so others will too. KCAC is following that trend while already in bed with VW, the largest car maker on the planet. That’s a good position to have and it will gladly do its part in the EV fight against ICE.On the date of publication, Nicolas Chahine did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.The post Ride the EV Wave into 2021 With Kensington Capital Stock appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ride-the-ev-wave-into-2021-with-kensington-capital-stock-2020-10-20

187,"Oct 20, 2020 2:31PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock has always been controversial. It is an emotional equity — in just the last two years it has completely transformed its financial situation. Remember, not too long ago, Wall Street was ready to leave TSLA stock for dead. Now it is healthier than ever and breaking records. So why exactly is TSLA stock so contentious? Well, no one can agree on the thesis behind the equity. Some bulls argue it is not a car company, but rather a technology company. Others say it is an alternative energy play. This lack of agreement, and the murkiness in its business goals, makes it difficult to short.There are too many different angles for critics to defend against. If they poke holes in its manufacturing abilities, they struggle to criticize its other potential. For example, even some of the biggest bears recognize it faces massive success in battery tech and autonomous vehicles.Even while causing shenanigans, CEO Elon Musk remedied its cash flow situation. Tesla can now sustain its global growth. Beyond that, bears now must respond to all of its different income streams. Just as with its battery prowess, Tesla is also leading the way in solar. Just this weekend I entered a waiting list for a home battery pack for my Sunrun (NASDAQ:RUN) solar panels. I came across it through Costco (NASDAQ:COST), so I bet that will become more ubiquitous.Largely, the negative headlines have been about the auto manufacturing side of Tesla. If I am right about its multiple income streams, what will come next is a series of incremental upside catalysts. Bears, you better run for cover.I want to be clear that I am not a super fan — I do not worship at the altar of Elon Musk. However, I recently changed my mind about TSLA stock because of its tangible results. In fact, even when I disliked the company, I rarely bet against it. Last May I even suggested a bullish trade. The plan then was to buy the dip into $144 or chase the rip above $175 per share. That strategy delivered a 160% rally.This is a momentum stock so it is difficult to trade. Companies like Tesla rarely provide easy entry points because they are always running fast up or down. On the way down, TSLA stock looks like it is falling into oblivion. Recently I caught the proverbial falling knife by selling bull put spreads on bad days. They expired in my favor for maximum gains. This is not to gloat, but to make the point that investors should not let emotions get in the way of a good trade.At this point in the TSLA stock story, it is futile to argue about why shares are acting one way or another. It is better to just trade the price action at hand. Investors should know that the current range has been consistent and the buyers are reliable — Tesla has an incredible following of convicted fans.From here, the stock will probably trade inside the macroeconomic prism. This means that if other stocks are rallying, so will Tesla. For confirmation, keep a close eye on its earnings report, which is due out Oct. 21. Quarterly results will give us more insight into the future.What else is in store? Just imagine the upside potential if fans start chasing headlines about battery packs or solar roof panels. As a car company, Tesla may not be a miracle. It will face competition from other electric vehicle companies down the line. But that does not matter to me. TSLA stock will benefit as long as Musk and his team can continue growing their delivery numbers.The bottom line for any company is to deliver sales growth that is in line with expectations. The current Tesla price-sales ratio is 16.7 times, which is high but not outrageous. I am not giving the all-clear signal to buy TSLA stock today. Instead, I am proposing that Tesla is not doomed to fail. It has support on the chart into $400, and even stronger support into $350. If for whatever reason the stock falls to those levels, it would present a great opportunity to buy on the dip.Active traders, on the flip side, can chase it above $467 per share. There could be $60 of upside waiting.Those who know how to use options can sell December $275 puts and collect $4 per contract. This trade would win even if Tesla stock falls 30% from current levels. The breakeven on the shares would be at $271.

188,"Oct 20, 2020 1:40PM EDT","Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), the world's most valuable automaker, releases Q3 2020 earnings on Wednesday evening, Oct. 21. But late Monday, investors got a glimpse at how the company fared in California, its largest U.S. market, thanks to a report from research firm Cross-Sell. Cross-Sell compiled vehicle registration data and found that, although overall third-quarter Tesla deliveries hit a record at 139,900, Tesla registrations were down 13% year over year in the Golden State. The primary culprit was a big drop in Model 3 registrations.Image source: Tesla.A pioneer in promoting electric vehicle (EV) ownership and use, California's electric vehicle market is seen as a bellwether for the U.S. EV industry as a whole. From July 2020 through September 2020, about 16,200 Teslas were registered in the state. That was an improvement from the 9,800 registrations in the previous quarter (April through June) but down from the more than 18,000 registrations in Q3 2019.Surprisingly, California registrations of Tesla's newest vehicle, the Model Y crossover SUV, surpassed registrations of the best-selling Model 3 sedan. Cross-Sell reported only 6,500 Model 3 registrations in California in Q3 compared to almost 7,300 for the Model Y. This could indicate that the Model 3 is approaching market saturation in California. Or it could indicate that consumers who previously bought the Model 3 because it was the only affordable Tesla on the market are more interested in a comparably priced crossover SUV than a sedan. Or it could just be a fluke.It's important not to read too much into a single data point from a single quarter. Cross-Sell compiled data from 23 states, which it said comprised about 65% of the U.S. market. It found that registration growth in other states offset California's declines, leaving Q3 registrations roughly unchanged at 32,800 vehicles.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

189,"Oct 20, 2020 1:32PM EDT","The Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) gained ground at midday on Tuesday, rebounding from a drop of nearly 2% on Monday. Investors seemed to feel more comfortable with the level of uncertainty facing markets right now, especially with key events like the 2020 U.S. presidential election looming ahead. Just after 12:30 p.m. EDT, the Nasdaq was up nearly 1%.Earnings season continues, and today, it was Logitech's (NASDAQ: LOGI) turn to blow its numbers out of the park with an amazing performance. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) hopes to match those gains when it releases its latest financials Wednesday afternoon, but investors seem less comfortable about the prospects for the electric-vehicle maker's stock.Logitech shares soared higher by 17%. The tech-peripherals specialist released fiscal second-quarter results that reflected a huge surge in demand from its customers.Image source: Logitech.Logitech saw a 75% rise in sales, compared to the year-earlier quarter, moving above $1 billion for the first time in its history. Adjusted earnings per share nearly quadrupled year over year, with operating cash flow coming close to tripling.CEO Bracken Darrell pointed to increased remote work as a driving force behind the sales gains. In addition, Logitech's line of products for video games plays well into the esports trend, which has picked up steam during the COVID-19 pandemic.Logitech boosted its full-year fiscal 2021 guidance, as well, expecting revenue to climb 35% to 40%. As long as people need to work from home, Logitech can count on selling them the products they need in order to get their work done.Meanwhile, Tesla saw its stock drop almost 2%. The company has gotten a lot of attention from investors lately, especially because it's reporting quarterly earnings on Wednesday, and many are viewing its performance as a signal of whether the overseers of the S&P 500 Index will name Tesla as a constituent.Shareholders have already gotten one of the most important reads on the quarter, because Tesla is quick to report production and delivery numbers as soon as possible after each three-month period ends. Earlier in October, Tesla said that it had delivered more than 139,000 vehicles during the third quarter, reaching a new record high. That was up by more than half from the number of units it got to customers during the second quarter of 2020.That's not likely to result in an equivalent rise in revenue, because the company is selling a larger mix of its more affordable Model 3 vehicles. However, current analyst expectations call for Tesla's top line to grow by more than 30%, and adjusted earnings per share could rise more than 50% from year-ago levels.Interestingly, Tesla is crimping its own profit margins with its anticipated growth trajectory. At its Battery Day event in September, Tesla announced a desire to get the price of its vehicles down to just $25,000. That's ambitious and will require significant advances in battery technology, but it isn't the first time Tesla has tried to move forward quickly.Investors should watch Tesla to see whether its profit growth looks sustainable and stems from its actual vehicle manufacturing, rather than from regulatory credit sales. An invitation to the S&P 500 could certainly bolster the stock's prospects.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

190,"Oct 20, 2020 12:24PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis summer has been a roller coaster ride for shareholders in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). The announced 5-1 stock split sent prices skyrocketing only to drop back to reality days later. Now, with the price creeping back up around the magical $450 mark, many are wondering if TSLA stock has peaked given ever increasing competition. Time to be a seller of Tesla on any rally.Positive potential with improvements to battery design and autonomous technology is enough for Musk to predict that Tesla will grow over the next five years. But there’s a significant problem with the business model. Tensions with China will put a damper on long term overseas growth for Tesla irrespective of future innovation.The phasing out of subsidies across the world is straining the overall business model. It is beyond dispute that Tesla turned China into a cornerstone of its operations. China is the world’s largest EV market and has a government that actively subsidizes the industry.The Pacific giant now accounts for over 23% of revenue for Tesla. Musk has done a great deal of work to make inroads with the Chinese government and secure favorable deals, including approximately $1.6 billion in China bank financing.The issue is that long-term access to the Chinese mainland may be outside of his control. China is phasing out its subsidies by 2022, which are incredibly important for the bottom line for TSLA. This is even more important given that sales in U.S and Europe dropped by more than 20%.It will do this concurrently with numerous traditional car brands expanding their EV fleet, which could significantly reduce sales in China and the ever-important sales of tradeable EV credits (another factor in achieving profitability).Access to the Chinese market itself altogether will also likely be lost over time. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas pointed this out in his recent downgrade of Tesla stock. He noted it was unlikely that U.S. and Chinese autonomous vehicle makers will be allowed to operate in each country indefinitely. Jonas went so far as to argue that Tesla China sales may be non-existent beyond 2030.The general hostility between China and the United States over national security concerns continues to grow. Tesla will be affected more than most companies. The president is forcing disinvestment from Chinese firms, and reports show that his administration may soon restrict Chinese tech giant Tencent. That’s troubling for Tesla when Tencent has a nearly $2 million stake in it and is considered an advisor to the company.Defense leaders in the U.S. Congress are also acting on fears that Musk and Tesla’s connections to China may pose for the country. For example, Sen. Cory Gardner recently proposed amendments to the NASA Authorization Act that target NASA contractors like Elon Musk.One congressional Republican aide told reporters, “What is there to stop them from going to Musk directly and saying, ‘We’ll call your line of credit early, unless you give us X, Y, or Z?’” It will likely be used as a soft ultimatum for Musk: either make Tesla move on from China or lose your contracts. This could be devastating for TSLA stock.Europe remains an enigma for Tesla. A growing EV market is buying less of its product. Tesla is going to try and overcome this issue with the addition of the Berlin factory. It is yet to be seen if European consumers will choose it over domestic competitors.Similar concerns rest in America. Tesla will try and compete by building electric pickups and expanding to Texas, but without the help of subsidies and tradeable EV credits. This means the company will eventually need to stand on making money from car production, which has proven to be unattainable so far.Competitors have a substantial opportunity to surpass Tesla in the market. This is especially true given the continued deterioration of market advantages. Remember, Tesla still has ongoing quality issues. Plus prices aren’t low enough to dissuade competitors from entering the market.The market is about to be flooded with new EV startups, some backed by established automakers. Let us not forget the likes of China-based Nio (NYSE:NIO) and Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI).Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD AmeritradeThe technicals point to a tired TSLA stock. There is major overhead resistance at $460. MACD just generated a fresh sell signal. Momentum has turned negative. A pullback to the $350 area seems the most likely course for Tesla stock.Earnings are due Oct. 21. So shorting TSLA stock now can be risky. Instead, a bear call spread positions to be a seller after earnings on a further rally higher. It is also a limited risk trade.Sell the TSLA November $450/$455 call spread for a $2 net credit.Maximum gain is $2 per spread with maximum risk of $3 per spread. Return on risk is 66%.On the date of publication, Tim Biggam did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.Anyone interested in finding out more about option-based strategies or for a weekly option and volatility newsletter can visit the Options and Volatility Newsletter website.The post The Tesla Stock Rally Is Starting to Lose Power appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-tesla-stock-rally-is-starting-to-lose-power-2020-10-20

191,"Oct 20, 2020 10:10AM EDT","By Rachit VatsOct 20 (Reuters) - Wall Street expects U.S. automakers to report strong results for the third quarter, as a recovery in sales after this year's initial coronavirus lockdowns tightens inventory for an industry watching cases in Europe and the United States rise.Starting with Tesla on Wednesday, investors will be most focussed on what executives have to say about the quarters ahead, as signs grow that the pandemic, which halted work earlier in the year, is again worsening.""It's going to be pretty strong earnings across the board,” said Deutsche Bank industry analyst Emmanuel Rosner, adding he expected all suppliers and carmakers to beat current forecasts.""Investors want to know what early 2021 is going to look like.""The pace of U.S. car and light truck sales has increased each month since shutdowns were lifted, and plants are working at close to full speed to rebuild inventories for high-profit sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks.In China too, General Motors Co GM.N and Ford Motor Co F.N are recovering, registering double-digit sales growth for the quarter.For GM, 12% year-on-year growth in July-September, marked the Detroit automaker’s first quarterly sales improvement in two years in the world's biggest market. For Ford, the 25% volume growth was its second consecutive quarterly sales increase in China after almost three years of decline.Most analyst also see automakers firming up their cash flow positions and repaying debt. GM indicated in July it would generate enough cash to pay off a $16 billion loan by the end of the year. But only if the U.S. economy continued recovering and there were no further significant production shutdowns.Shares of GM, down 9% so far this year, have recovered since hitting a low of $16.8 in March. Ford shares have fallen about 19% and were as low as $4 in mid-March.(Reporting by Rachit Vats in Bengaluru; editing by Patrick Graham)((Rachit.Vats@tr.com; Reuters Messaging:rachit.vats.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/preview-wall-street-sees-profit-recovery-for-automakers-but-will-it-last-2020-10-20

192,"Oct 20, 2020 9:33AM EDT","It's been a wild year for Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) shareholders. The stock is up more than 400% year to date. Over the past year, shares are up nearly 800%.While the growth stock's big gain recently is great for shareholders, it means expectations are high going into the electric-car company's third-quarter earnings report this week. Ahead of the quarterly update on Oct. 21, here's a preview of some of the key areas investors may want to check on. Image source: Tesla.Sharp revenue growth for Q3 is pretty much already in the bag. A few days after the quarter ended, Tesla said it delivered record quarterly deliveries during the period, with total deliveries rising 43% year over year.The bigger question about Tesla's financials during the quarter is regarding the company's profitability. Analyst estimates for the automaker's earnings per share for the period span a wide range, with the lowest estimate calling for $0.23 per share and the highest for $0.98. The average estimate is notably $0.56, which translates to a 51% jump compared to the year-ago quarter. Investors will also look to Tesla's quarterly shareholder presentation to get a progress update on the company's ongoing expansion efforts. In Q2, Tesla said it had an annual production capacity at its factory in Fremont, California of 400,000 units for Model 3 and Model Y combined. But management said that this installed capacity would extend to 500,000 units at some point in 2020. Did Tesla achieve this before Q4 started?Further, Tesla said it was building Model Y production capacity at its factories in Shanghai and Berlin. Look to see whether the automaker completed construction on these important production lines. Finally, investors will want to see whether Tesla is maintaining its guidance for 500,000 deliveries this year. To deliver 500,000 vehicles in 2020, Tesla would need to deliver more than 181,000 vehicles in Q4 alone. This would imply huge growth both year over year and sequentially, as Tesla delivered about 112,000 and 139,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the third quarter of 2020, respectively.Regarding vehicle delivery guidance, investors should also look to see if Tesla provides any commentary on demand for its vehicles. Did Tesla exit Q3 with a record backlog of vehicle orders? Without record orders, Tesla may not maintain full confidence from investors in the company's growth story.Tesla reports its third-quarter results after market close on Wednesday.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

193,"Oct 20, 2020 8:38AM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInvestors interested in electric vehicles should expand their search from the vehicles to the technology required to keep them running. Switchback Energy (NYSE:SBE) is set to be a leader in this evolving arena, and SBE stock is one to seriously consider buying. Evolving is a key word here. In the United States, electric driving is in its very early stages. Widespread acceptance of transportation powered by electricity and fuel cell seems inevitable, though. Why? Because these vehicles offer many advantages without the pollution that results from internal-combustion engines.However, getting to where the vehicles are commonplace will require development of infrastructure. This is where Switchback Energy and Chargepoint, its soon-to-be-partner, enter the picture.Switchback Energy is not a wildcat oil exploration outfit or an established energy producer along the lines of Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM).Switchback is a special purpose acquisition company, or a SPAC, which is a different route to take a company public. As the tag implies, these companies are shells created to merge with a firm wanting to go public. The SPAC raises money, conducts an IPO (thus SBE stock) and has a limited window to make a deal.SPACs aren’t new but they have gotten popular as an alternative to the traditional route of an initial public offering. Retail investors can get in early by buying shares of the SPAC before the merger. The focus of this column, Switchback Energy, was formed in 2019 and is based in Dallas.Shares of SBE stock are trading around $15, which isn’t too far off its 52-week high of $16.45. The peak was reached after the merger with Chargepoint was announced. The 52-week low was $9.38.Chargepoint is a privately held (for now) company that installs and operates charging stations for electric vehicles. It also manufacturers equipment for its service. The company is considered an established leader in this developing field in both the U.S. and in Europe. Chargepoint operates about 115,000 charging stations.The company raised about $600 million from private investors for the reverse merger with Switchback.Based in Campbell, California, Chargepoint was formed in 2007. It has drawn a variety of investors ranging from a pension plan to an electric utility to a branch of Chevron (NYSE:CVX). Last year, the company reported a loss of about $133 million. It forecasts 2020 revenue to total $135 million, which would be a drop from about $147 million posted in 2019.The pending reverse merger with Switchback Energy will result in a company named Chargepoint Holdings. Pasquale Romano, the CEO of Chargepoint, told CNBC recently that the pending reverse merger with Switchback Energy is on much stronger footing than other SPAC deals.“We’ve had a 10-year track record of shipping products and supporting customers,” he said. “We don’t have the risks of a pre-revenue company.”The company forecasts 60% annual compound growth to top $2 billion after seven years.Chargepoint’s ambitious growth forecast is based on the anticipated increase in electric-vehicle use. Thanks in part to the pioneering spirit and success of Tesla (NADAQ:TSLA) and the performance of hybrids, American consumers no longer view battery-powered vehicles as too exotic to consider.And remember, Tesla limits use of its charging stations in the U.S. to Tesla vehicles.This off-limits stance sets the stage for companies like Chargepoint.Switchback Energy is a SPAC preparing to complete a merger with Chargepoint, a maker and provider of charging stations for electric vehicles in the U.S. and Europe.The resulting Chargepoint Holdings appears to be poised to expand and try to cement its lead in setting up charging networks in private homes, apartment complexes and public sites, such as retail store parking lots. Moreover, this merger is happening as the fossil-fuel addicted U.S. appears ready to embrace this cleaner alternative way to power transportation.Long-term investors should seriously consider buying SBE stock. When compared to other SPACs, this deal appears to be in a better starting position.Yes, as in any stock investment, there is risk. In this case, though, SBE stock has more going for it.On the date of publication, Larry Sullivan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.Larry Sullivan is a veteran journalist in Florida who has covered banking and finance for several years.

194,"Oct 20, 2020 8:26AM EDT","Some of Robinhood's top 100 stocks carry some pretty steep share prices. In fact, the six most expensive --Amazon, Alphabet Class A, NVIDIA, Netflix, Zoom, and Tesla -- would've cost you a whopping $6,807 as of the close of trading on Monday, Oct 19. 2020. It's easy to see why these are popular stocks. Amazon dominates the e-commerce marketplace; Alphabet is Google's parent company; NVIDIA invented GPUs used to create graphics on electronic devices; Netflix enjoyed first-mover status in the streaming video industry and remains a dominant player; Zoom has become the primary means of communication for millions amid a pandemic; and Tesla made electric cars cool.  Of course, you shouldn't buy shares in these or any other companies just because they're popular. And you can't assume each one is necessarily worth its high share price. But if you've done your research and feel some or all of them fit well into your investment portfolio, it may be frustrating to feel you can't afford to buy simply because of their high per-share prices. The good news is, you don't actually need anywhere near $6,807 to purchase all six. In fact, with just $6.81, you could buy them all. Image source: Getty Images.Buying all six of these stocks, or buying any one of them individually, can set you back only a few dollars with many brokers now allowing you to buy just a small portion of a share -- sometimes as low as .001 of one. With fractional shares, you simply acquire a stake based on the dollar amount you have available, even if you can't buy a full share. With Amazon, for example, instead of buying a full share at $3,207.21 on Oct. 19, you could've bought .001 of a share for $3.21 total. If it's the right investment choice for you, you could do the same with each of the six most expensive stocks Robinhood investors love. The total cost of purchasing .001 share of each would add up to just $6.81, compared with $6,807 for full shares of all six. Image created by author.Although buying fractional shares will cost you far less than full shares, the performance of your investment won't be affected by the fact you bought a smaller stake in each company.When an investor purchases any number of shares, they buy a fraction of the total outstanding number of shares the company has issued. Investors who buy fractional shares just purchase a smaller stake. You'll still make the same percentage gains as other investors; if the combined share prices go up 10%, your $6.81 investment would also appreciate 10%, making you around $0.68 while full-share investors would earn $680.70. Plus, you'll be paid dividends the same as any other investor, with the amount you receive based on the percentage of shares you own. With most brokerages no longer charging commission, these small transactions shouldn't come at any cost beyond what you're paying for your portion of a share. Thanks to fractional shares, the size of your wallet no longer puts you at risk of being priced out of buying these or other hot stocks just because of their high share price. You can develop your comprehensive investing strategy without regard to whether the per-share cost of investments is out of your budget and buy shares in companies that make sense for you. 10 stocks we like better than WalmartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

195,"Oct 20, 2020 7:07AM EDT","The 2020 election is approaching, and in 2021 America might see a Green New Deal signed into law.Note that I didn't say ""will,"" but ""might."" If President Trump wins reelection, chances of a Green New Deal passing into law seem slim, inasmuch as the president has warned that ""it'll kill millions of jobs"" and said ""I will not stand for it."" And to be honest, a full-blown Green New Deal might not pass muster under a Biden Administration, either. Image source: Getty Images.Debating President Trump on Sept. 29, Vice President Biden insisted that ""the Green New Deal is not my plan"" and confirmed that ""no, I don't support the Green New Deal."" Two weeks later, when moderator George Stephanopoulos asked Biden to confirm his position at a televised town hall meeting, the Vice President responded: ""My deal is a crucial framework, but not the new green deal [sic]. The new green deal calls for elimination of all non renewable energy by 2030. You can't get there."" And yet, if you listen to the vice president's other remarks, it really does sound like he might be in favor of something that's Green New Deal ... ish. This could be very good news for renewable energy companies like Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), First Solar (NASDAQ: FSLR), and Sunrun (NASDAQ: RUN).Vice President Biden may not support the Green New Deal per se, but he clearly does support many green ideas, promising, for example, to:Biden insists that ""the future rests in renewable energy,"" which he says is now ""cheaper than coal, is cheaper than oil right now, and it has great, great promise.""And for the record, it's not just Vice President Biden saying this. As far back as March 2019, Yale University was confirming that ""nearly 75 percent of coal-fired power plants in the United States generate electricity that is more expensive than local wind and solar energy resources."" What's more, by 2025 -- about the end of a prospective Biden first term -- Yale notes that ""enough wind and solar power will be generated at low enough prices in the U.S. that it could theoretically replace 86 percent of the U.S. coal fleet with lower-cost electricity."" Now, which renewable energy companies should investors be looking at today to reap the benefits of that brighter tomorrow?As indicated above, I think electric car, battery, and solar roof company Tesla is a great place to start, as it has a finger in most of the key solar ""pies"" already -- from renewable energy usage all the way up the supply chain through storage and generation. Tesla finally became sustainably profitable late last year, and has now put together four straight quarters of GAAP net profit. Analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence forecast Tesla's profits will continue through the end of this year, giving Tesla its first ever complete-calendar-year profit -- and projections call for the company's profits to only grow bigger as America's ""electrification"" continues in the years to come.Tesla may turn into a terrific winner from a pseudo-Green New Deal -- but here at The Motley Fool, we always urge investors to diversify their holdings, and not put all their eggs in any single basket. For this reason, investors might want to also consider buying into solar companies First Solar or Sunrun as well, just to spread out their risk a bit.Whereas Tesla makes most of its money from electric cars, First Solar specializes in ""thin film"" solar panel construction. Last week, Goldman Sachs named it one of the banker's favorite solar companies. Coming off of a rough 2019, First Solar has rebounded this year, putting together back-to-back profitable quarters in the first half despite the pandemic. If it continues at its current run-rate, the company could conceivably generate a full-year profit in excess of $435 million, which would give the stock a price-to-earnings ratio of just 20.5 -- considerably cheaper than Tesla's trailing P/E ratio of ... 1,080. Meanwhile, Sunrun is making a run at locking up the market for installing solar panels on customer rooftops. The company closed on its merger with Vivint Solar just last week -- and at first glance I have to say that that looked like a mistake, as in recent years Sunrun has done a better job earning profits than Vivint. That being said, when announcing their merger, Sunrun and Vivint predicted that combining their operations would generate $90 million in cost-savings -- possibly enough to turn the merged enterprise profitable again.   Now add to this potential Vice President Biden's clear preference for renewable energy investments -- and his specific preference to invest in products that are both ""clean and new"" and ""made in America"" -- and I see a real potential for investors to profit from U.S.-based Tesla, First Solar, and Sunrun.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

196,"Oct 20, 2020 6:06AM EDT","It's been a wild year on Wall Street. The benchmark S&P 500 has broken many records. We've witnessed the fastest bear market decline of at least 30% in history, the quickest rebound to new highs from a bear market low on record, and the highest-ever reading for the CBOE Volatility Index.This heightened volatility and steep first-quarter sell-off have created a lot of interest in the stock market and investing. In particular, we've witnessed the meteoric rise of FinTwit in 2020.FinTwit, or Financial Twitter (NYSE: TWTR), describes a wide-ranging financial investment community on Twitter that seeks to share information and educate readers so the group can become wiser and richer. As someone who regularly peruses and engages with the FinTwit community, I've watched it blossom since the February-March crash.While information on FinTwit should not be construed as concrete recommendations to buy or sell particular stocks, it does help investors decipher what stocks and trends are of interest to the financial community. Trends and stocks that get a lot of buzz could well be worth your attention.Image source: Getty Images.The following companies are five of the most discussed stocks on FinTwit.Arguably the most talked-about stock on Financial Twitter is also the most polarizing company of the group: Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). Among the FinTwit community, there is no middle ground. Users either think Tesla's going to the moon or that it's going bankrupt.Without question, Tesla CEO Elon Musk deserves credit for creating the first successful mass-produced auto company in more than five decades. Tesla could potentially deliver north of 500,000 electric vehicles (EV) in 2020. It recently announced plans to improve the battery range of its EVs while lowering long-term costs. Electric vehicles are the future of the automotive industry, and Tesla is in the driver's seat on the EV innovation curve. On the other hand, Tesla hasn't produced a full-year generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profit. It has also relied on EV tax credits to pump up its adjusted profits. Further, while Musk has proved a genius, he's also a liability for the company. There have been numerous instances where a tweet or comment has gotten Musk in trouble. It's also unclear if Tesla can maintain its competitive edge over deep-pocketed peers.It remains to be seen if Tesla can live up to the investment community's exceptionally lofty expectations. However, history suggests that all bubbles eventually burst.Image source: Getty Images.Among tech stocks, there isn't a company that FinTwit seems to fancy more than edge cloud platform services provider Fastly (NYSE: FSLY).As some of you might know, Fastly was clobbered last week after the company revised its third-quarter sales guidance. Having previously called for between $73.5 million and $75.5 million in sales, Fastly now anticipates reporting between $70 million and $71 million in revenue. The company cited weakness from TikTok, its top user, during the recently ended quarter as the reason for the revision. President Trump had been threatening to ban TikTok downloads in the U.S., which presumably hurt its usage. However, Fastly's lowered guidance still represents a 42% increase in year-over-year sales at the midpoint. It also follows a second quarter that saw Fastly's customer count advance at a pace not seen since its initial public offering.Fastly is ultimately a business based on data usage. The company needs businesses and shoppers to continue to push online and into the cloud to be successful. While it's unfortunate that TikTok had a subpar quarter, in terms of usage, Fastly's future remains bright. A majority of its existing clients appear to be spending more, and that should help improve the company's gross margin over time.Image source: Square.Another company the FinTwit community can't get enough of is fintech stock Square (NYSE: SQ). Generally speaking, FinTwit loves finding companies capable of disrupting established industries. Payment facilitator Square could do just that.Square is best known as a payment and growth facilitator for small businesses. The company has been providing point-of-sale solutions, data analytics, and even loans to small businesses for years. Between 2012 and 2019, the gross payment volume (GPV) processed by its network grew by roughly $100 billion to $106.2 billion. With Square's seller ecosystem reliant on merchant fees, a 49% compound annual growth rate in GPV between 2012 and 2019 isn't too shabby.But what has FinTwit abuzz is peer-to-peer payment platform Cash App. In just 2 1/2 years, Cash App's monthly active user (MAU) count has more than quadrupled to 30 million. The company's second-quarter results also announced that 7 million of these MAUs are using Cash Card, a traditional debit card that links back to a user's Cash App balance.Cash App is a high-growth, next-generation payment platform that could become increasingly popular with Generation Z and millennials throughout the decade. By as soon as 2022, it might be Square's leading generator of gross profit.Image source: Getty Images.The fourth and fifth most talked-about FinTwit stocks are Teladoc Health (NYSE: TDOC) and Livongo Health (NASDAQ: LVGO). I've chosen to address them together because Teladoc is in the process of acquiring Livongo in a cash-and-stock deal that was valued on the day of the announcement at $18.5 billion.Teladoc seems to have the inside track to becoming the telemedicine kingpin. There's no doubt that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has aided the company's business. In the second quarter, total visits more than tripled from the prior-year period, with doctors wanting to keep at-risk patients out of their practices as much as possible. Keep in mind that the company's compound annual growth rate prior to COVID-19 was a scorching 75% since 2013.Maybe the best news for Teladoc Health is that telemedicine is a win up and down the healthcare industry. Virtual visits are cheaper for health insurers and more convenient for patients and physicians. As for Livongo Health, it's become the most exciting applied health signals company around. Using artificial intelligence, it sends tips encouraging members with chronic illnesses to make lasting behavioral changes that will improve their health. The company has consistently seen its diabetes member count double or nearly double on a year-over-year basis, and it's reported three quarters in a row of adjusted profitability.Once Teladoc and Livongo become a single company, it'll be on the leading edge of personalized medicine.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

200,"Oct 19, 2020 8:00PM EDT","Oct 19 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc's TSLA.O vehicle registrations in the U.S. state of California dropped 13% in the third quarter compared with last year, according to data from Cross-Sell, a research firm that collates title and registration data.The report released on Monday showed registrations in California, a bellwether for the electric-car maker and its largest U.S. market, recovered from a second-quarter low of roughly 9,800 vehicles to around 16,200 vehicles in the three months ended September. But third-quarter numbers lagged some 13% behind last year's due to a large drop in Model 3 registrations.California registration for Tesla's Model 3 mass-market sedan, which in the past accounted for more than half of total registrations, fell 60% on a yearly basis to 6,500.At nearly 7,300, registrations in the state for Tesla's Model Y compact crossover utility vehicle surpassed those for the Model 3.Earlier this month, Tesla said it delivered 139,300 vehicles in the third quarter, an all-time record, yet shares fell as some analysts doubted if the world's most valuable carmaker could hit its ambitious year-end target of half a million deliveries. Total third-quarter vehicle registrations in the 23 states  where data was collected and which Cross-Sell said account for 65% of the U.S. market, remained roughly equal to last year at around 32,800 vehicles.Registration figures might not accurately reflect the number of vehicle deliveries during the quarter as registrations in the United States typically take about 30 days from the time of sale.Tesla, whose shares have surged more than five-fold this year, is expected to report third-quarter results after market close on Wednesday.(Reporting by Akanksha Rana and Ayanti Bera in Bengaluru and Tina Bellon in New York Editing by Matthew Lewis)((akanksha.rana@thomsonreuters.com; ; Twitter: @AkankshaRanaa;))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tesla-third-quarter-registrations-in-california-drop-13-data-2020-10-19

202,"Oct 19, 2020 2:47PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBeyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) stock has been one of the best performers in the market in 2020, with shares rising more than 140% year-to-date on the back of accelerating momentum in the plant-based meat megatrend. On the heels of this enormous rally, bears have started to come out of the woodwork. Most recently, Bernstein downgraded BYND stock to Underperform, calling the valuation on Beyond Meat far too stretched for its own good.Ostensibly, that does appear to be the case. Beyond Meat’s market cap hovers around $11.5 billion. Trailing twelve month sales sit at $400 million, meaning Beyond Meat’s stock sports a price-to-sales ratio of 29. America’s largest traditional meat producer, Tyson (NYSE:TSN), trades at 0.5-times trailing sales.From that perspective, the “BYND stock is overvalued” thesis seems to make a lot of sense.But that thesis misses the big picture, and the big picture here is that plant meat is the future of eating. Beyond Meat is the unrivaled leader in the plant meat space, and the company will sustain enormous growth over the next few years on its way to unseating Tyson as America’s largest meat producer.Tyson’s market cap? Double Beyond Meat’s market cap.So, from that more comprehensive perspective, BYND stock is not overvalued today. Instead, this stock remains a long-term winner that should be bought on big dips.Here’s a deeper look.There are a lot of consumer megatrends out there. Few get as much flack as the plant meat megatrend, mostly because there’s a lot of steak and burger lovers out there.And I get it. I love a good steak and juicy burger as much as the next person. Probably even more. But, even as a huge meats lover, I’ve come to realize that plant-based meat is the inevitable future of this industry.Why?Because plant-based meat is currently and/or will soon be logically superior to animal-based meat in every single way. Simply consider:All in all, the writing is on the wall. For a myriad of reasons, plant-based meat is the undeniable future of meat consumption.Of course, that’s great news for BYND stock.I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. Plant-based meat is today, where electric vehicles were about a decade ago in terms of mainstream global disruption — and Beyond Meat is the “Tesla of the plant-based meat megatrend.”That is, plant-based meat is marching towards global ubiquity, and Beyond Meat is the unrivaled leader in this space.Beyond Meat’s unrivaled leadership comes down to a few things.First, the company has huge technological advantages. Making plant-based meat isn’t easy, and Beyond Meat is much better at it than others in the space, as shown by its 50% repeat-purchase rate.Second, Beyond Meat has distribution advantages. Beyond Meat is already in 118,000 retail and food-service outlets, and has signed big deals with McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), Yum (NYSE:YUM) … and many, many more. That number is also growing by ~20% every quarter. So, by the time other players enter this space, Beyond Meat will already be everywhere — and in many of those places (like fast food chains) Beyond Meat will have exclusive deals in place.Third, the company has a branding advantage. Beyond Meat has become the brand for plant-based meat in many consumers’ minds, mostly because of its broad distribution channels. So, if a first-time entrant into the plant-based market is looking for something to buy at a grocery store, they will almost certainly start off with a Beyond Meat product.Thanks to these advantages, Beyond Meat is well-positioned to sustain and extend its dominance in the plant-based meat market as this market goes from niche to mainstream over the next decade.As that happens, BYND stock will keep flying higher.By my numbers, Beyond Meat’s stock — even at today’s elevated levels — still has compelling long-term upside potential.You have to remember, the global meats market that Beyond Meat is aggressively disrupting measures $1.4 trillion, and on the meat production side of the market, it’s essentially an oligopoly ruled by five major players, all of whom do $15+ billion in annual sales.Make no mistake. Beyond Meat will be that big one day. The plant-based meat megatrend is simply too big and too powerful — and Beyond Meat too far head of competitors — for the company not to be a $15+ billion revenue company one day.Simultaneously, because plant-based meat production is cheaper than animal-based meat production, Beyond Meat operates at significantly higher margins than traditional meat producers. Tyson’s gross margins hover just north of 10%. Beyond Meat’s gross margins are marching towards 40%.Assuming economies of scale will help drive Beyond Meat’s opex rate down to a more normal 20% rate, then Beyond Meat one day projects as a $15+ billion company with 20% operating margins. That growth profile implies that $2+ billion in net profits is totally doable in the long run.A simple 20X multiple on that implies a potential future valuation for Beyond Meat of $40+ billion. To be sure, it will probably take the company 10 to 15 years to get to that point. Still, using an 8.5% discount rate, that implies a net present value for Beyond Meat of anywhere between $12 billion and $18 billion.Contrary to popular belief, BYND stock is not overvalued today, with a market cap of $11.5 billion. It’s only overvalued if you don’t look at the big picture. Once you look at that big picture, it becomes clear as day that this company has tremendous long-term upside potential in the plant-based meat megatrend.So, while I don’t think it’s wise to chase BYND stock on the heels of this huge rally, I also don’t think it’s smart to cash out.

203,"Oct 19, 2020 2:35PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFollowing a correction, are shares of EV upstart Workhorse Group (NASDAQ:WKHS) a buy? Let’s look at what’s going on in the market, as well as both off and on the price chart of WKHS stock, before deciding on a stronger risk-adjusted determination for today’s investors.After defying a broad-based September sell-off led by the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, a bit of bearish seasonality has finally gotten the better of WKHS. Impressively, shares had been up as much as 58% in September. The stock also managed to finish the month up nearly 40%. But October has proven a bumpier ride.Workhorse shares are off 12% since Oct. 1 and 27% beneath their late September highs. This past week, WKHS further stressed the stock market is made up of individual companies whose shares are always at risk of further decorrelation. Into last Friday’s close as the Nasdaq and top stocks Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and others gained modest ground to scratch their way to one-month highs, WKHS collapsed nearly 15% over five sessions.Adding salt to WKHS’ painful price behavior, many EV names fared better. Tesla (NASAQ:TSLA) put in a similar performance to its large-cap peers, but China’s Nio (NYSE:NIO) soared higher by almost 33% to all-time highs. New-to-the-market XPeng (NYSE:XPEV) took in more than 8% on the week.To be fair, Workhorse shareholders can commensurate with Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA). Nikola was also under pressure and finished down 20% for the weekly period. Still, Nikola has been a company-specific car wreck the past couple months with allegations of fraud from Hindenburg Research continuing to haunt the stock.So, what’s behind the dampened spirits at Workhorse? Apparently, WKHS stock has a bit more in common with Nikola than just shares being firmly lower last week. Much of Workhorse’s price weakness can be attributed to bearish follow-through after short-seller Fuzzy Panda Research released a scathing attack on the company. The boutique investment advisor warned on Oct. 8 that Workhorse misled investors as it vies for the United States Post Office’s $6.3 billion next-generation vehicle contract.Fuzzy Panda claims that the company’s vehicles are plagued with issues and exceed the USPS’ maximum cost guidelines. The firm also said Workhorse’s one-time partner, VT Hackney, has already backed out of the bid due to ‘critical failures and breakdowns.’Its Lordstown Motors Corp. stake is more hype than sales substance. Not to mention a much-publicized UPS contract for 950 trucks is non-binding and unlikely to be fulfilled.
Source: Charts by TradingViewSo, Fuzzy Panda has sunk its claws into WKHS stock. The good news is today’s investors may be able to thank the outfit in the not too distant future. Following last week’s volatile fallout, Workhorse could be forming a more durable and constructive high-level double-bottom, or ‘W’ pattern.The simple fact is all stocks correct. And often enough, even in healthy market environments, technical leadership can fall victim to this type of bump in the road. Of course, some corrections can go on to become larger bear markets. But adherence to the WKHS price chart can help with that.The slightly unusual aspect of this particular double-bottom is the mid-pivot high and low of the base are part of the same weekly candlestick. Now that’s volatility! With stochastics on the cusp of a bullish oversold crossover signal, the price spread sets up more strongly as a stock for investors to consider buying on weakness rather than strength.My recommendation would be to wait for a stochastics crossover, then simply set a stop beneath the still unconfirmed pivot low. For straight-up stock traders and for a volatile stock of Workhorse’s caliber, this is a decent-looking risk-to-reward opportunity within a healthy market.Alternatively for longer-term investors willing to look past Fuzzy’s less-than-transparent research, using a flexible stock option collar can appreciably make a great deal of sense through bearish and bullish market cycles in WKHS.

204,"Oct 19, 2020 11:38AM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGores Metropoulos (NASDAQ:GMHI) stock is the latest autonomous vehicle (AV) play widely available for investors. The SPAC (blank-check company) will soon close on its deal to acquire Luminar. As the shift to AVs accelerate, this company, a maker of lidar sensors that make self-driving possible, could see tremendous growth over the next decade.Yet, despite these prospects, GMHI stock has sold off in recent weeks. After rallying as high as 37% over its $10 per share offering price, the stock today trades around $10.50 per share.Yet, you can chalk up much of this decline to the overall sell-off in SPAC stocks on news of increased regulations. This factor does little to change the company’s underlying growth story. Sure, it’s going to take years for things to play out.But, given how quickly the company has expanded in less than two years, continued rapid growth seems possible. And with the pullback giving investors a more favorable entry point, now may be the time to take a small, long-term position.So what’s the story with this SPAC’s acquisition target? Luminar is one of several names providing Lidar technology to the automotive industry.What is Lidar technology? Lidar short for light detection and ranging, is basically laser radar. It’s the sensors and software that allow self-driving cars to safely operate. Most companies developing self-driving cars are going with Lidar-based systems. The major exception? Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which prefers camera-based systems.But, despite Elon Musk bucking the trend, chances are lidar becomes the norm for AVs. Currently, lidar systems are not cost-effective for widespread use. But, with this company and its rivals working to bring costs down, that could quickly change in a matter of years.And what’s the long-term potential for Luminar, and in turn, GMHI stock? As InvestorPlace’s Mark Hake broke it down Oct. 14, this company could be a $5 billion business by 2030. Granted, the company’s pro-forma valuation (around $3.6 billion) prices in much of this upside. But, there’s plenty of reason why this emerging auto tech name meet (or exceed) investor expectations.Luminar already has a major partnership deal with Volvo (OTCMKTS:VLVLY). Other potentially lucrative deals could be in the cards. Yet, it’s not all a slam-dunk. With a major competitor already dominating the lidar space, this upstart could have its work cut out for it.As it brings the costs of its lidar sensors down, Luminar has a shot at capturing a large share of this fast-growing market. But, as this industry grows, the competition could get intense. It doesn’t help there’s already an established rival, Velodyne Lidar (NASDAQ:VLDR), “crushing it” in this space.In fact, it’s currently the lidar industry leader. Yet, this dominance may not last for long. If Luminar can beat this large rival on cost, it could quickly climb to the top of the heap.Currently, lidar costs are as high as $75,000 per unit. But, this company could eventually bring the cost down to $1,000 a unit.However, Velodyne is working to bring costs down as well. And, with its first mover advantage, what’s to say it doesn’t continue to dominate? Given that company’s market capitalization (around $3 billion) is below the pro forma valuation for GMHI stock post-Luminar deal, VLDR stock appears at first glance the better risk/return proposition.Yet, focusing too much on near-term performance may be missing the forest for the trees. Luminar may be one-third the size of Velodyne. But, it’s achieved that level of sales in under two years. With the partnerships with Volvo and scores of other automakers, it’s easy to see the tables quickly turn.Also, it may not wind up a “winner-take-all scenario.” Small long-term positions in both names could be worthwhile, especially given VLDR stock has recently sold off as well.There’s no guarantee Luminar will live up to its ambitious 2030 revenue goal. But, with its success bringing down lidar costs, as well as inking a major commercial partnership, this AV technology upstart has as much of a shot as its larger rival (Velodyne) in winning big as the self-driving megatrend plays out.So, should you buy GMHI stock while the deal is still pending? I don’t see why not. Granted, it’s no “bet the ranch” scenario. This is a high-risk/high-return type of opportunity. It may be years until it pays off for investors. In the meantime, shares could see high volatility, as Luminar tries to scale into a $5 billion business.Yet, after the recent sell-off in this SPAC’s shares, a small position in GMHI stock may be worthwhile. Just don’t go hog wild.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not (either directly or indirectly) hold any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Thomas Niel, contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single stock analysis since 2016.The post Gores Metropoulos Is a Cautious Buy Before the Luminar Deal Closes appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/gores-metropoulos-is-a-cautious-buy-before-the-luminar-deal-closes-2020-10-19

205,"Oct 19, 2020 11:08AM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis year has been one wild ride after another. The events have been unique in almost every facet. The pandemic forced a hard reset button on the whole world. The routine for every person on the planet has changed. Economically the impacts have been mostly devastation but pockets of strength have emerged in the equity markets. Within those are a slew of hot stocks breaking records.Today we look at three stocks that have caught fire for different reasons. Their stocks have big gains and more potential wild action ahead. There are opportunities for profit but stocks this hot carry a ton of risk. The fundamentals on momentum stocks like this are thin because their potential rewards are set in the future results.Meanwhile, investors are taking bets on their businesses now almost in panic mode. Finding good entry points is challenging. It’s near impossible to be surgical identifying a sane starting point. Therefore, investors must use as many tools as possible, including technical chart action, to avoid disastrous mistakes. Studying the thesis is important but so is choosing the levels to trade.Today’s three hot stocks are:NetEase recently split its stock, so it will take a few weeks for it to find its new grove. Meanwhile, it continues to consolidate, so it can rebuild its base after its last eight week slide. NTES stock is 14% off its August highs, but also 68% above the March lows. It is still 23% above the February levels just before the novel-coronavirus-induced quarantine. This confirms that Wall Street does not think that NetEase has any obvious problems specific to itself. In fact, year to date, it is performing 22% better than the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ).Fundamentally, the company is set in the right segment. Gaming is now bigger than ever thanks to a boost in popularity from the pandemic. When people are stuck at home they game more often. Also after the reopening the trend continues to be less socializing; therefore, there are more opportunities for other forms of entertainment. China is important to NetEase and it was the first country to start the recovery from the outbreak. That could lead to a tailwind for NTES stock.Valuation matters and it is reasonable. There is no obvious bloat there. The 2019 net income doubled from that of 2016 so they are on the right track. Judging by last year’s quarterly results, the coming months are important. Since this year gaming is big, the company could surprise investors to the upside. Earnings are coming soon and it will be worth holding shares into it.Otherwise, there is support at $85 and $80 per share. These are big pivot zones that the bulls will likely defend. If stocks in general correct, then the NTES stock February neckline lurks near $74 per share. The bulls are probably comfortable knowing that the most likely short-term pain scenario is just 6% below. They still have to be cautious because when it lost $90, it could have triggered a bearish pattern to $77. But it’s not necessarily going there without help from the broader markets.Solar stocks rallied 35% from late September most likely from speculation on the U.S. election outcome. A change in leadership could bring good things for alternative power. The opportunity today is to find a decent entry point into RUN stock. The whole cohort like Invesco Solar ETF (NYSEARCA:TAN) and First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) recently rallied 30%, but RUN has given up almost all of it. Nevertheless, year-to-date it is still up more than 500%, which is still ten times more than FSLR.Last week RUN fell back into the September base, so it is back into good footing for bullish bets. If for some reason the selloff continues, then there are two other bases below. The first is near $56 per share from the pivot in late August. The second is at and around $45 from early August. The recent upside may have gone too far ahead of actual improvements in the fundamentals. Wall Street has a habit of throwing fits after big rallies on headlines.They don’t ring bells for perfect entries into stocks, so investors need to make judgement calls. A big determining factor is the time frame in play. Long-term investors can nibble into RUN stock around these levels. Doing so in stages makes the most sense to leave room for error. The October rally was electrified by political speculation, so it is fraught with danger. Any change in the sentiment over the election outcome will bring severe disappointments in solar stocks. Since RUN has given up most of its greens then maybe it would hold up better than the rest.In the end and regardless of who wins, the fundamental improvements have to come from within. The viability of solar power has to make economic sense for the consumers. We got solar for our house in California from Sunrun in 2017, but only because it was almost free. The offer through Costco (NASDAQ:COST) was too enticing to pass up. The more exciting step would be to add the off-the-grid solution. Therein lies the longer-term opportunity. It makes sense that we all have backup battery power. As of this weekend, I am waiting for my quote on this from RUN. The choices they noted are LG and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).One of the hottest themes this year is electric vehicles (EVs), especially the startups. The Special Purpose Acquisition Corporation (SPAC) concept is all the rage on Wall Street this year. Workhorse is one of those companies that took the shortcut to come public. The stock has done very well so far. But for the last two weeks WKHS stock has hit the skids to the tune of 30%. There could be more pain just because it has very little intrinsic value on its current profit and loss statement.This company is still in pre-production, so the whole thesis is based on faith in forward progress. However, there is a lot of support on the stock chart near $20 per share. Emotions are running high this year among investors; one way to neutralize this emotion is by relying on technical information. The correction from $31 per share has reached its intended target near $20 twice. This sets a trade-able bottom, making it a viable thesis to add shares for the very long term. If an investor missed it the first time around in September, this is their second chance to get on board.This means that the risk in it must be low enough to not devastate the investor portfolio. In other words, don’t go all in yet. It’s something that has not yet developed tangible financial results. It is exciting to take part in the future, but the internal combustion engine is still the winning ticket. EVs are mounting a challenge to that, but they have a long way to go. Tesla has paved the way for the likes of WKHS. This makes for a smoother ride for them than it was just last year.The current Tesla financial metrics have improved so drastically that it is on better footing than Ford (NYSE:F) or General Motors (NYSE:GM). The expansion continued to accelerate even through the worst economic downturn ever. This is an incredible feat and proves the concept. Workhorse will benefit from that. The company is a risky opportunity bet. The exciting part is that the sky’s the limit and it will take time to prove it wrong or right. Until then, the bulls have the edge, so buying the dips makes sense. This applies to all three. But conviction in hot stocks is almost always medium to low at best.On the date of publication, Nicolas Chahine did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.The post 3 Hot Stocks to Trade Into the New Year and Beyond appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-hot-stocks-to-trade-into-the-new-year-and-beyond-2020-10-19

208,"Oct 19, 2020 9:40AM EDT","By Patturaja  Murugaboopathy  and Gaurav DograOct 19 (Reuters) - Technology companies led by their founders have been the standout winners in share price performance and profit growth this year, beating companies led by other managers, according to a Reuters analysis.Major founder-led tech firms have seen their share prices double so far this year, comfortably beating a 7.8% gain for the S&P 500 index .SPX.They have also outperformed rival tech firms led by hired managers, enriching investors and adding billions of dollars to the wealth of the founders themselves, including Amazon's AMZN.O Jeff Bezos, Netflix's NFLX.O Reed Hastings and Tesla's TSLA.O Elon Musk.Profit growth has outperformed too, with founder-led tech firms seeing growth of around 30% over the past five years versus 6.7% for companies led by other managers.Founder-led tech firms have a history of higher returns and faster recovery in the aftermath of a financial crisis. For instance, in the last bull cycle Amazon's shares surged fifty-fold, while those of Netflix's rose by 100 times.""Great entrepreneurs thrive in down periods when tectonic shifts are occurring in how business is done.

Analysis of capital expenditure (capex) plans suggests why investors think founder-led companies might have an edge.In the first half of this year, founder-led companies have seen a 20% growth in capex, whereas spending on future growth at companies led by others has fallen 2%.According to Refinitiv data, founder-led firms are expected to post average net income growth of 22.8% in the next three years, compared with 7.1% growth for non-founder led companies.Ric Marshall, executive director of MSCI ESG Research, said most founder-led firms would outperform non-founder led companies in both price performance and profit growth this year.But while they provide greater opportunities for investors,  founder-led companies also come with higher risks, he said.""In my experience the widely held CEO-led companies were the safer bet – less likely to outperform, but also much less likely to result in dramatic losses,"" he said.Top founder-led companies' earnings growthhttps://tmsnrt.rs/3kF8k68Sector breakdown for price performance this yearhttps://tmsnrt.rs/3kAI9xiSector breakdown for estimated earnings growth in 2020https://tmsnrt.rs/2HobcpFFounder led companies' earnings growth and performance (tech vs non-tech companies)https://tmsnrt.rs/35aCQi6(Reporting by Patturaja Murugaboopathy and Gaurav Dogra; editing by Thyagaraju Adinarayan and Mark Potter)((patturaja.murugaboopathy@thomsonreuters.com;))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/graphic-founder-led-firms-outpacing-ceo-led-ones-in-market-recovery-2020-10-19

210,"Oct 19, 2020 8:56AM EDT","Most investors have heard of the hot coronavirus stocks by now.""Stay-at-home"" favorites like Zoom Video Communications and Peloton Interactive have skyrocketed this year on the back of triple-digit revenue growth. Tech stocks similarly have crushed the market, especially in cloud computing and e-commerce. Even the mighty FAANG group has seen mouthwatering gains, pushing Apple to a $2 trillion market cap and Amazon past $1.6 trillion. Electric-vehicle stocks, led by Tesla, have also boomed.However, the recovery may have already shifted gears. Stocks peaked more than six weeks ago, and concerns about a fading recovery in the job market and jitters around the election could rattle the market even further. Investors may want to look beyond the high-profile tech names to sectors that have been mostly ignored thus far, and one area that seems ready to take off is auto parts. Though the sector typically outperforms during a recession, the top auto parts stocks have only delivered average returns this year, essentially tracking with the S&P 500. Data by YCharts.As you can see, Advance Auto Parts (NYSE: AAP), O'Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ: ORLY), and AutoZone (NYSE: AZO) are actually all trailing the broad-market index slightly, but these companies have already begun to experience robust recoveries from the depths of the crisis.Data by YCharts.Revenue has bounced back, and all three of these companies saw profits jump by more than 30% in their most recent quarters with Advance and O'Reilly seeing gains in the 50% range. Better yet, there are a number of signs that their performance will only accelerate from here.Auto-parts retailers tend to thrive during recessions and their aftermath, because they sell products consumers need, not just what they want. Most Americans need a vehicle to get to work or take care of regular errands, and especially during economic downturns, Americans tend to delay buying a new vehicle and instead focus on maintenance and repairs, which means trips to the auto-parts store.However, this recession, brought about by a once-in-a-century pandemic, is also unique as it has spurred demand for personal vehicles as Americans look to avoid public transportation and ride-sharing services for safety reasons.Image source: Getty Images.Auto sales as a whole have jumped during the pandemic. According to the Census Bureau, sales of auto vehicles and parts surged 10.9% in September and 7.5% in the third quarter. The used car market has been the biggest driver of that growth.Used car dealers like Carvana and Vroom have been unable to keep up with demand, and both companies have reported rising prices for used cars. Edmunds.com reported that August and September were the fastest months for used car inventory turnover in six years. Those trends are likely to remain strong as a vaccine is at least months away, and the need for personal vehicles isn't changing. Many of the auto-parts companies are seeing similar trends.AutoZone, which was the most recent of the group to report earnings, posted domestic comparable-sales growth of 21.8% in its fiscal fourth quarter (ended Aug. 29). Adjusted earnings per share were also up 47.6% year over year. CEO William Rhodes sounded bullish about the coming months on the earnings call, saying: ""And if the economy enters a deep and protracted recessionary environment, we continue to believe our customers will focus more on maintaining their current vehicles, and it will benefit our business -- retail in particular -- as it has in the last three recessions."" From fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2011, same-store sales growth averaged 5.4%. Rhodes also noted that August comps, which came after enhanced unemployment payments ended, showed strong growth at 16.5%, and he speculated that sales would remain elevated ""for some time.""During the second quarter, when the global economy was cratering, O'Reilly's comparable sales rose 16.2%, and earnings per share jumped 57%.  Management at O'Reilly and Advance echoed Rhodes' comments.Considering these stocks are seeing double-digit comparable-sales growth that's flowing to the bottom line, they look downright cheap. In fact, all three trade at a discount to the S&P 500 based on their price-to-earnings ratios: 23.8 for Advance, 22.9 for O'Reilly, and 16.6 for AutoZone. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 currently has a multiple of 35, which is elevated due to the decline in earnings during the first half of 2020.Analyst estimates have been moving higher for the sector, but they still seem to be underestimating the tailwind of the pandemic and economic downturn. At AutoZone, for example, the consensus estimate is for just 4% earnings-per-share growth for the fiscal year that just started. Analysts expect to see a 21% gain at O'Reilly this year, but that figure declines to just 2% in 2021. And Advance is actually forecast to see flat earnings growth this year.Keep in mind that these companies usually experience a surge in demand during a typical recession, and the additional impact of the pandemic means that they are likely to put up record growth during this time, as we saw in their most recent reports, all of which crushed estimates. The numbers from the Census Bureau also show that momentum in the auto sector accelerated in September, boding well for the parts sellers.If these companies outperform once again in their upcoming reports, the stocks should take off.10 stocks we like better than AutoZoneWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

214,"Oct 18, 2020 12:46PM EDT","On Wednesday, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) will report its third-quarter results. After announcing record third-quarter deliveries, expectations for the electric-car maker's financial performance during the period are high. Even more, a soaring stock price over the past year has raised the stakes for Tesla to keep growing its business rapidly.Will the automaker be able to live up to the hype?Ahead of the earnings report on Wednesday, some investors may be wondering whether or not they should buy shares of the growth stock before the update. After all, if Tesla announces better-than-expected revenue and earnings per share, the stock could jump.To better understand whether the electric-car company's shares are attractive today, here's a quick earnings preview and an analysis of the stock's current valuation.Model X. Image source: The Motley Fool.Earlier this month, Tesla said it delivered a record 139,300 vehicles during its third quarter. This was a huge jump from Q2 -- when the automaker's main vehicle factory temporarily forced to shut down because of the coronavirus. Vehicle deliveries surged 53% sequentially in Q3. However, growth was also impressive when compared to the year-ago quarter -- a period Tesla's operations were at full capacity. Deliveries soared 43% year over year.In 2020, Tesla's business is benefiting from the launch of its new Model Y SUV earlier this year. As the company's most affordable vehicle yet, management expects Model Y sales to eventually rival sales of is Model 3 -- Tesla's best-selling vehicle.Model Y. Image source: Tesla.Analysts expect Tesla's strong sales growth to lead to impressive top- and bottom-line growth, too. On average, analysts expect revenue to rise 31% year over year to $8.26 billion and non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share to jump 51% to $0.56.With Tesla's business firing on all cylinders, is Tesla stock a buy ahead of earnings?The automaker's earnings report could, indeed, send the stock soaring following the report. But shares could just as easily crater if Tesla misses the mark in some area. It's simply too difficult to predict which direction the stock will move in the wake of the report.Even more, an investment in the stock should be based on an investors' view of the company's long-term potential anyway -- not based on the results of a single quarter.Zooming out beyond the current quarter, investors should note that Tesla stock's valuation already prices in massive growth over the next decade. The company has a market capitalization of more than $400 billion despite trailing-12-month revenue coming in at just $26 billion. Free cash flow, or excess cash flow left over after both regular operations and capital expenditures are taken care of, was just $800 million over this same period.The market has arguably already priced in both continued leadership in electric cars and significant market share gains in the overall global auto market. Because so much optimism is already priced into the stock, I'd prefer a better entry point than $445 per share. Perhaps if investors get lucky and the stock falls below $400 following the earnings report then the stock might begin to look attractive.For now, however, I'd rate Tesla stock a ""hold"" going into its earnings report on Wednesday. Of course, there's no guarantee Tesla stock will ever retreat to this level again. But I don't mind waiting on the sidelines, hoping for a more reasonable valuation.Tesla's third-quarter earnings will be posted after market close on Oct. 21.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"
215,"Oct 18, 2020 10:51AM EDT","Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has set its sights on building an affordable car with a $25,000 starting price -- again. At the company's Battery Day last month, Tesla announced a slew of innovations designed to reduce battery production costs by up to 56% while also increasing range and power. As my Foolish colleague Daniel Sparks noted at the time, a new ""tabless"" cell design was the biggest breakthrough, but Tesla also discussed changes to the cells' form factor, battery chemistry, and manufacturing process, among other things.Working to bring down prices is the right strategic focus for Tesla. However, its stated goal of offering a $25,000 car within three years seems far-fetched. Additionally, with better, cheaper batteries on the way, it will be increasingly difficult for Tesla to meet its volume growth goals over the next few years.There are two facets to the first major challenge Tesla faces. The first relates to whether it will be able to reduce costs enough to earn a reasonable profit on a $25,000 car. After all, when Tesla ramped up deliveries of the cheaper (sub-$40,000) Model 3 variants last spring, its gross margin plunged to 18.9% in Q2 2019 -- and closer to 17% excluding regulatory credits -- down from around 25% in the second half of 2018. It quickly made the $35,000 standard-range Model 3 an ""off-menu"" option to push buyers to pricier versions that it could produce profitably.The cheapest version of the Model 3 available on Tesla's website is the ""standard range plus"" option, which has a starting price of $37,990. This variant has a 54-kWh battery. Third-party sources have put Tesla's 2019 battery costs between $127 per kWh and $158 per kWh. Even at the high end of that range, the battery for a standard range plus Tesla 3 would cost less than $9,000.Image source: Tesla.Thus, even if Tesla succeeds in all of its cost-reduction objectives related to batteries, the savings might be on the order of $5,000. That alone wouldn't get Tesla close to being able to make a $25,000 car profitably.The second issue relates to timing. Tesla did not bring a prototype of its new battery design to the Battery Day event. This raises questions about how far along it is in the development process, which requires solving some tricky problems. Moreover, Musk has frequently talked about how difficult it is to scale up manufacturing of new technologies, relative to just building a prototype.This makes it unlikely that a $25,000 vehicle could be available in as little as three years. Another reason to take this projection with a grain of salt? CEO Elon Musk said more than two years ago that a $25,000 Tesla could come to market in about three years (i.e. 2021). That obviously isn't happening.Another big challenge for Tesla is driving sales of its current products before the new battery technology becomes available. Musk has previously talked about targeting 50% annual growth in vehicle deliveries. At that pace, Tesla would deliver over 1.2 million vehicles in 2022 and more than 1.8 million vehicles in 2023.Image source: Tesla.Achieving that level of growth would be difficult under any circumstances. It requires moving well beyond the early adopters and enthusiasts. Additionally, there appears to be only one high-volume product on the way to help Tesla reach these numbers (the Cybertruck).This task will be complicated if people believe that Tesla will soon have vehicles on the market offering 50% or more additional range at significantly lower prices. Whereas early Model 3 buyers have seen their cars depreciate very little over the past few years, future buyers won't be so lucky if Tesla puts new products that are better and cheaper on the market by 2025.Of course, this isn't to say that Tesla shouldn't pursue advancements that will eventually reduce battery costs and improve performance. It is much better to disrupt your existing products than to wait for a competitor to do so. But investors shouldn't ignore the impact of this coming disruption to Tesla's products and pricing, either.All in all, Tesla's Battery Day presentation showed that the company is focused on the right goal: driving down costs to make its vehicles more affordable. Tesla wouldn't be able to meet its long-term growth goals or fulfill its mission ""to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy"" with its current product portfolio.Furthermore, while Tesla has plenty of work to do to achieve the specific target of a $25,000 car, it has a more credible game plan for reducing costs than it did when Musk talked about this goal back in 2018.However, while Tesla appears to be on the right track, it's not clear how far down the track -- and thus, how far ahead of competitors -- the electric vehicle pioneer is right now. As a result, I would be wary of investing in Tesla at its premium valuation of more than $400 billion.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

216,"Oct 18, 2020 9:00AM EDT","By John McCrankNEW YORK, Oct 16 (Reuters) - As a technology-driven rally brings U.S. stock indexes within striking distance of fresh records, concerns that big names are over-extended and thatnew regulation might be coming have some investors diversifying beyond the rally leaders.The S&P 500's five biggest companies, Apple Inc AAPL.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O and Facebook Inc FB.O now account for 28% of the index's weighting and have been responsible for 25% of its earnings, Goldman Sachs said earlier this month.On average, these tech and internet-driven stocks have gained 49.23% this year, compared to a 7% gain for the S&P 500 - and are up 9.6% on average since Sept. 21, versus 6.6% for the S&P 500. They are expected to report strong third-quarter earnings in coming weeks, proving their mettle in a year when the coronavirus pandemic fueled a work-from-home economy while devastating companies linked to sectors like travel, restaurants, and fossil fuels.(Graphic: S&P 500's big tech boost https://tmsnrt.rs/2SUGbw3)Still, some worry that mega-cap tech companies are exposed to factors that may cut their allure in the months ahead. Being long technology is the most crowded trade of all time, according to a recent Bank of America fund manager survey. ""It's all about trying not to have all your eggs in one basket,"" said Laura Kane, head of Americas thematic investing at UBS Global Wealth Management. ""It's about trimming certain exposures and rotating into something else.""UBS analysts have recommended diversifying out of mega-cap tech stocks on signs of an economic recovery and climbing valuations. They urge rebalancing into U.S. semiconductors, which are more sensitive to economic recovery, as well as emerging market value stocks and United Kingdom-based equities.Societe Generale analysts also recently cited a challenging regulatory environment as one reason to diversify out of U.S. tech shares and into Asian ones and European stocks.Regulatory concerns have heightened following a scathing report detailing market power abuses by Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook issued earlier this month by the U.S. House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel. The report has raised concerns that tough new rules and stricter enforcement for big tech companies will follow should Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden win the White House. A potential breakthrough in the search for a COVID-19 vaccine also could also spur bets on shares of economically sensitive value and cyclical stocks that may benefit from a stronger economic recovery, potentially dimming the appeal of tech, Soc Gen analysts said. L1N2H61ZCThe median 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio for the Big 5 tech stocks is 31, while the S&P 500 trades at a 12-month forward PE ratio of 22, according to Refinitiv. Still, they are not as extended as in the dotcom period, with overall profitability, dividends and balance sheet strength in much better shape than 20 years ago. Companies investors will be watching next week as they report third-quarter results include Netflix Inc NFLX.O on Tuesday, Tesla Inc TSLA.O and Verizon Communication Inc VZ.N on Wednesday, and Intel Corp INTC.O on Thursday. Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook report the following week.Many investors still see the big tech names, with their strong balance sheets and financial results, as havens as coronavirus cases continue to climb and the economy struggles with a lack of new fiscal stimulus.""These companies deliver powerful profits,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors. ""People have to keep in mind that the five largest tech companies make more in earnings than the entire Russell 2000 combined, so this isn't the internet bubble.""It might be a good idea to trim some tech exposure if the position has gotten too overweighted, but the sector's gains are largely being driven by fundamentals, said Michael Farr, president of Farr, Miller & Washington LLC.To rotate out of tech because of big gains and some recent volatility would be ""a suckers' trade,"" he added.

217,"Oct 18, 2020 8:12AM EDT","The stock market’s strong rally from the March lows has indisputably been driven by Big Tech. But how much higher can we go, particularly amid the pandemic?We are certain to get answers to this question (and others) this week as the third quarter earnings season kicks into high gear with results expected from technology heavyweights Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX) — two FAANG components that have seen their stock prices rise within striking distance of all-time high levels. We will also get results from Microsoft (MSFT), Intel (INTC) and Tesla (TSLA) - each of which have something to prove. Among the three, Tesla will likely be the biggest story.The electric vehicle maker has promised to deliver 500,000 vehicles for the current fiscal year and analysts (and the bears) will be eager to see if Tesla, which has future plans of producing a fully autonomous electric car for $25,000, will double down on those projections. It will certainly be a drama-filled week that delivers many answers. On the investment front, we will know whether the recent rotation out of “growth” and into “value"" has lasting power.On average, analysts forecast Q3 earnings to rise 5% sequentially. And over the past three earnings earnings revisions have trended higher, rising by about 4.5%. You would have to go all the way back to the first quarter of 2018 to find the last time upward earnings revisions were this high. While that’s an encouraging figure, it has to be noted that it would still mark a 20% earnings decline year over year. Beyond the tech sector, analysts are encouraged by the recent strength in sectors such the consumer discretionary and cyclical sectors like industrials.Friday’s strong consumer sentiment data, combined with more optimism about additional fiscal stimulus, creates the perfect setup for a market rally this week. Conversely, the market is known to punish companies for falling short of expectations and issuing weak guidance. Here are this week's earnings names to keep an eye on:Netflix (NFLX) - Reports after the close, Tuesday, Oct. 20Wall Street expects Netflix to earn $2.13 per share on revenue of $6.38 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings were $1.47 per share on $5.24 billion in revenue.What to watch: Despite year-to-date gains of 67%, it still seems as if Netflix has moved under the radar so far in 2020. While the company didn’t excite investors with its second quarter miss on customer subscription totals, the 10 million it did deliver was 3 million more than its own guidance. What’s more, Q2 revenue rose 25% year over year to $6.15 billion, topping consensus estimates of $6.08 billion. In other words, there is still a lot to like with this story. The stock has risen about 9% over the past month as Covid cases continue to rise, suggesting more shelter-in-place restrictions could be underway. The streaming giant guided for only 2.5 million new subscribers in the just-ended quarter, which is 50% below consensus estimates. This tells me that Netflix put itself in a position for a strong beat on Tuesday.Microsoft (MSFT) - Reports after the close, Wednesday, Oct. 21Wall Street expects Microsoft to earn $1.54 per share on revenue of $35.72 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earning were $1.38 per share on $33.05 billion in revenue.What to watch: Work and learn-from-home trends continue to power increased demands for Microsoft services, evidenced by the strong Q4 demands in its Productivity and Business and Intelligent Cloud segments. But the strength of Microsoft’s Commercial Cloud business has been, and will continue to be, the catalyst for the stock’s strong year-to-date return of 40%. Last quarter Azure revenue was up 50% year over year — a slight deceleration from the 61% growth in Q3. Wall Street remains broadly positive about the company’s prospects to achieve double-digit revenue growth in fiscal 2021, driven by Azure's momentum. On Wednesday investors will want some evidence that Azure and Microsoft’s Teams (a Zoom (ZM) competitor) can continue to propel the company higher.Tesla (TSLA) - Reports after the close, Wednesday, Oct. 21Wall Street expects Tesla to earn 56 cents per share on revenue of $8.26 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to 37 cents per share on revenue of $6.3 billion.What to watch: With year-to-date gains of 430%, shares of Tesla have run over every bear standing in its way. While skeptics continue to scoff at the stock’s high valuation compared to the rest of the auto industry, the bears insist on relegating the company to just an auto-manufacturer. But when assessing the company’s growth trajectory and its diverse product portfolio, which — aside from electric vehicles — includes batteries, software, solar roof/panels, Tesla is more than a one-trick pony. It is a sustainable energy company. The question is, can the stock continue to drive higher Wednesday? That all depends on whether the company can deliver a GAAP profit for Q2 which would mark not only its fifth straight profitable quarter. In Q2 Tesla’s automotive margins fell to 18.7% in amid plant shutdowns.Amazon (AMZN) - Reports after the close, Thursday, Oct. 22Wall Street expects Amazon to earn $7.25 per share on revenue of $92.48 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to $4.23 per share on revenue of $69.98 billion.What to watch: Shares of Amazon have moved 5% higher this week as investors anticipate not only strong numbers from Prime Day, but also better-than-expected results for the Q3. The e-commerce giant is executing at near perfection evidenced by the 40% rise in total net revenue in the second quarter. The company is benefiting from a combination of factors. Aside from the strong demand acceleration caused by the pandemic, Amazon continues to be effective in its strategy not only to grow its Prime members, but also getting them to spend more during each transaction. And there is tons of evidence to suggests that its market share gains are here to stay, beyond the pandemic. As such, while some investors might be concerned about near-term margin pressure, it would be a mistake to part with this long-term winner.Intel (INTC) - Reports after the close, Thursday, Oct. 22Wall Street expects Intel to earn $1.11 per share on revenue of $18.22 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings were $1.42 per share on revenue of $19.19 billion.What to watch: What can Intel do to redeem itself? Its shares were clobbered by 12% following its second quarter announcement, during which the company said it would delay its 7nm-based chip by 18 months to two years. This seemingly gave Intel’s rivals, namely Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), a strong lead which would be hard for Intel to regain. The news overshadowed what was otherwise a great quarter as Data Center Group revenue soared 43%, driven by 47% increase in cloud service provider revenue. With the stock still down 10% year to date, Intel looks like a bargain. But the company on Thursday must show better execution and market share gains from improving demand in personal computer sales due to the work-from-home environment.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/weekly-preview%3A-stocks-to-watch-amzn-intc-msft-nflx-tsla-2020-10-18

218,"Oct 18, 2020 5:16AM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOne of the pivotal reasons why electric vehicles have soared this year is due to their relative simplicity. Historically, Chinese automobile manufacturers attempted to compete with their Japanese and Korean counterparts, only to be met with failure. The reality is that making quality internal combustion engine cars is difficult. But with EV batteries, most of that complexity is sidestepped, bolstering the fundamentals case for Nio (NYSE:NIO) stock.Essentially, EVs have fewer moving parts than combustion cars. By removing that component and replacing it with a lithium-ion battery pack, the heart of the EV becomes commoditized. However, that also removes most of the character of a car. Although I can’t say for certain, I’d bet that’s why Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) doesn’t want to build an EV. For the iconic exotic car company, character is one of the reasons why it’s in the business.But Nio doesn’t care about that. Instead, it’s about making green — and if helps keep our planet green, so be it. More importantly, by having the most difficult aspect of building a car commoditized, the company can instead focus on design. And boy, does it make some very attractive cars. Undoubtedly, this played into the enthusiasm for Nio stock.However, with shares up almost 655% on a year-to-date basis, it’s fair to wonder if Nio stock is in bubble territory. On the surface, there’s nothing to worry about. According to a BusinessInsider.com report, JPMorgan upgraded the shares to overweight, forecasting a $40 price target.Not to be outdone, Citigroup analyst Jeff Chung upgraded Nio stock to an equivalent of buy from hold, assigning a price target of $33.20 from $18.10.Both analysts see a dramatic rise in China’s EV market, which on the surface makes sense. Throughout the world, interest in EVs has soared. As well, charging infrastructure is being built out, making the transition much more accessible. Still, you’ve got to wonder if things are getting a little bit out of hand.When I saw the sharp rise in NIO, I felt that the price action looked familiar. Sure enough, the price action resembles that of another company that I follow closely, Sony (NYSE:SNE).But for this exercise, we’ll need to go back in time to 1999, specifically from May 19 to Oct. 12. During this period, SNE soared from $38 to over $66, which was fairly remarkable considering that shares were already booming since the early 1990s.Interestingly, between May 22 to Oct. 15 of this year, NIO enjoyed a much more extraordinary rise, jumping from $3.27 to $28.07. But the main takeaway is that when you stack these two trends together, they share an extremely strong 93.4% correlation coefficient. In fact, when you stack the two trends together, they almost look identical.In the near term, that bodes very well for NIO stock. You have to remember that flying to $66 was just the start for SNE. It would go on to hit $140 before falling back down to earth.But why couldn’t Sony keep up the momentum? Here’s the BBC’s analysis on the issue:Wall Street valued Sony incorrectly for the same reason that Sony continued to misunderstand its own value: In 2000, Wall Street and Sony both believed that Sony was a device maker and that ever-improving devices would rule the world.The truth has turned out to be more powerful than that. Devices are merely servants, connected to the broadband networks that more than three-quarters of U.S. homes have, or wirelessly connected to the home networks or coffee shop hotspots that have doubled in use since tablets came around.But even this fact was misread by people at Sony. Sir Howard Stringer himself boasted on stage at the CES 2009 electronics event that 90% of Sony devices would connect wirelessly by 2011.That still misses the point. A platform world teaches us this truth: it’s not the device that matters, it’s not even the connected device that matters. It’s the connected experience that matters.Then, this little fruit company called Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) came along and changed everything. While I believe that international EV adoption should rise once we get past the pandemic, investors ought to be careful about exposing themselves too deeply to Nio stock. Here’s the reality — the GDP per capita in Beijing, China is 164,000 yuan or roughly $24,479.Think about that, $24,479. Nio’s “economy” car, the EC6, starts at a pre-subsidy price of approximately $54,000. In contrast, the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model 3 starts at around $35,000. But these cars are popular in areas such as Los Angeles, which has a GDP per capita of around $69,000.Now, with a metric like that, it’s much more believable that people are out buying Tesla EVs. However, with a GDP per capita of only 35% of that figure, it’s less credible to believe that these Chinese consumers will buy EVs that are priced 54% higher.I understand that Nio is experimenting with a Battery as a Service model. But that only cuts the price down by a little more than $10,000. You would still be talking about a car that costs well over $40,000. And I’m sorry but you cannot buy a car like that when your salary is less than $25,000.Further, like what happened with Sony, Chinese consumers that are paying that kind of money will want the pizzazz of western luxury brands. For consumer electronics, the biggest catalyst may be the connected experience. But in the automotive world, it’s all about the badge.Right now, Tesla arguably carries the most prestige. But what happens when Europe’s top car brands start to develop EVs? Or say Toyota’s (NYSE:TM) Lexus brand? And that they start offering their higher-profile cars at equivalent or maybe even lower prices?We’re probably a few years away from that happening. As well, if Nio stock is indeed tracking Sony’s trend from decades ago, it can hit bonkers numbers. But just be prepared with an exit plan. While nearer-term upside is possible, this is starting to look like a bubble.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in SNE.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

219,"Oct 17, 2020 10:30AM EDT","It might seem odd that connected car specialist Cerence (NASDAQ: CRNC) has seen its shares jump by more than 150% so far this year, considering that the economy has entered a recession and the cyclical auto market is often the first to get hit under those macroeconomic circumstances, but the company has been scoring numerous design wins throughout 2020.That includes prominent deals like powering the voice control system in Volkswagen's new ID.3 electric vehicle, as well as collaborating with NIO, often billed as the ""Tesla of China."" With that momentum, can Cerence shares keep climbing?Image source: Cerence.On Friday, Needham initiated coverage on Cerence, starting the stock off with a buy rating alongside a price target of $82, representing 54% upside from Thursday's closing price.Analyst Rajvindra Gill believes that penetration of conversational artificial intelligence (AI) technology will more than double to over 60% in the next three to five years as cars continue to get smarter. Cerence, which was spun out of voice recognition specialist Nuance Communications last year, is the clear leader in the space, with a current installed base of 325 million cars that integrate its offerings. Half of all new cars shipped in 2019 featured Cerence technology.There are numerous factors that will drive that adoption, in Gill's view. Vehicles are increasingly needing access to real-time data like mapping and weather information, drivers are using more voice-controlled virtual assistants than ever before, and automakers keep looking for new ways to address the problem of distracted drivers. The rise of ride-sharing and shared mobility will also boost demand, as will autonomous driving and increasing adoption of electric vehicles that generally tend to be more technologically advanced.Cerence enjoys differentiation from its competitors by leveraging AI and deep learning to ""form the building blocks for the company's voice engine,"" according to Gill. The company's currently sources of revenue include licensing, connected revenue, and professional services, but Cerence is working to build a software-as-a-service (SaaS) business to generate recurring revenue. That initiative is still nascent, but it holds considerable potential to monetize the existing installed base of vehicles.The company's total addressable market is large and continues to grow. Additionally, Cerence has strong visibility into its future revenue pipeline since it currently has a backlog of approximately $1.4 billion. While the company warns that its backlog isn't a perfect proxy for future revenue because there are fixed and variable factors, CFO Mark Gallenberger expects half of the backlog to be recognized within the next three years, with the rest hitting the top line thereafter.Gill's price target is based on a hybrid model that leans on a multiples-based analysis and a discounted cash flow (DCF) model.10 stocks we like better than Cerence Inc.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

220,"Oct 17, 2020 7:20AM EDT","It's been an incredible year for special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, which in 2020 have become a preferred vehicle for early-stage companies wanting access to public markets.A SPAC, also known as a blank-check company, is a shell that goes public and then merges with an existing business. The alternative to a more traditional initial public offering has been used by a range of companies this year including DraftKings and Nikola.Investors were initially enamored, with shares of DraftKings and Nikola both more than doubling after their SPAC mergers closed. But recent issues at Nikola have tempered the enthusiasm for these stocks, and reminded investors of the risks that can be associated with young companies.It now appears the markets got ahead of themselves, and the SPACs were in a bubble. But that doesn't mean there aren't good companies with bright futures coming out of the excitement. Here is why we believe Kensington Capital Acquisition (NYSE: KCAC), Hyliion Holdings (NYSE: HYLN), and Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE: SPCE) are SPAC stocks that have what it takes to be long-term survivors.Image source: Getty Images.Lou Whiteman (Kensington Capital): On paper, Kensington Capital appears to be just the sort of company investors should treat with caution following the Nikola debacle. The SPAC has a deal in place to merge with QuantumScape, a pre-revenue start-up developing a better battery for electric vehicles.QuantumScape is working on a solid-state lithium-metal battery that in theory has a lot of advantages over the lithium-ion batteries currently in use. On paper the solid-state battery should be more stable and offer greater energy density than current generation of batteries. That means they should be safer and offer more miles per charge.The higher energy density should also lead to a need for fewer batteries, reducing the weight of a vehicle and over time hopefully bringing down the cost.There's a lot of ""should"" and ""hope"" written into that description, and indeed many have tried to push solid-state batteries forward without much success. QuantumScape's attractiveness comes from those who are backing it.Bill Gates is an investor, as is one-time Tesla Chief Technology Officer J.B. Straubel. Straubel, who is on QuantumScape's board, called the design ""the most elegant architecture I've seen for a lithium-based battery system,"" saying ""the company has an opportunity to redefine the battery landscape.""QuantumScape also counts Volkswagen as an investor and customer. Volkswagen is positioning itself to be a leader in electric vehicles, creating a huge potential market for QuantumScape batteries. And post-merger QuantumScape will have more than $1 billion in cash and funding commitments, giving it significant runway to get up and running.On the Kensington side, I'm encouraged that CEO Justin Mirro was involved in the due diligence leading up to the merger. Mirro is a longtime industry investment banker and one-time General Motors engineer who knows the auto business as well as anyone, and has a list full of contacts that can help QuantumScape go to market.Mirro is expected to remain on the board following the deal's close.John Rosevear (Hyliion): The fall of Nikola didn't just turn many investors away from SPACs, it also (to some extent) tarnished the idea of electric trucks as a potential growth industry.That's too bad, because Hyliion has a smart approach to the problem of cleaning up diesel-powered big rigs. Yep, it's a SPAC company -- it went public via a merger with SPAC Tortoise Acquisition last month -- but it's a real company, with a smart business plan and strong management. What makes Hyliion so smart is that it's not out to disrupt the heavy-truck business. Instead, it has neatly inserted itself into the heavy-truck supply chain with a solution that can clean up existing trucks, right now.There are trucks with Hylliion's hybrid powertrain already on the road, with many more to come. Image source: Hyliion.Hyliion has two products. The first, shipping now, turns an existing diesel tractor-trailer truck into a more efficient hybrid. The second, coming to market soon, is a full powertrain that consists of electric motors and a small battery pack, along with a generator powered by natural gas that keeps the battery topped off. (Once costs come down, Hyliion says, that generator could easily be replaced by a hydrogen fuel cell, making the truck entirely emissions-free.) Hyliion doesn't have a factory of its own -- a twist that removes a level of risk for investors. Instead, it has partnered with established auto-industry supplier Dana, which manufactures its products and ships them directly to truck manufacturers or aftermarket installers as required. Hyliion's products are compatible with trucks made by all six of the major semi manufacturers today. Thanks to the deal with Tortoise, Hyliion has plenty of money in the bank -- about $560 million, enough to get its full powertrain to market without the need for additional cash. It's a nice business that is aiming, elegantly, to fill a big need in the market as truck fleets come under increasing pressure to go green. Rich Smith (Virgin Galactic): From about $10 before its IPO-via-SPAC last year, to a high of more than $37 a share before the coronavirus tanked the market, Virgin Galactic's nearly fourfold rise in stock price in the space of a few months once seemed both unprecedented and out of whack. At least it did until Nikola posted an eightfold increase in even less time this year, and then more and more SPACs came on the scene, and performed similar feats with regularity.Of course, just as happened with those other SPACs, momentum traders eventually lost interest in Virgin Galactic once it stopped going up reliably day in and day out. With Virgin stock trading today for less than $22 a share (a meager 120% gain over less than a year), the question becomes: Does this business have enough going for it to turn Virgin Galactic into a growth stock once again?I, for one, believe that Virgin Galactic will make it through the great SPAC shakeout just fine and resume growing, for three big reasons.First: money. With nearly $360 million in the bank but a cash burn rate of less than $245 million a year, Virgin Galactic has a good 18 months ahead of it before it needs to raise more cash to get its business off the ground.Second: time. Long before the money runs out, Virgin Galactic should begin flying paying customers to space and generating revenue to offset its expenses. At last report, founder Sir Richard Branson was planning to take his first flight aboard a Virgin spaceplane in the first quarter of 2021, after which commercial flights can commence. Call it six months -- nine at most.And third: money, again. Virgin Galactic already has sold some 600 customers tickets to space at $250,000 a pop -- $150 million in assured future revenue. Another 700 customers have anted up $1,000 to save their place in line, to buy tickets on flights even further out. And according to Cowen & Co., there's a total addressable market of 2.4 million potential multi-millionaire customers out there after these customers have flown their flights.With a market this big, and no competition yet in sight, there seems to be no limit to how high Virgin Galactic stock might eventually fly -- at least, once it conducts that very first commercial flight.10 stocks we like better than Virgin Galactic Holdings IncWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

221,"Oct 16, 2020 4:35PM EDT","One of the more innovative and unusual customer-service policies in the auto industry might be coming to an abrupt end. Next-generation transportation and energy website Electrek reported on Friday that Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has decided to cancel its seven-calendar-day, no-questions-asked, full-refund return policy.Citing ""sources familiar with the matter,"" the article stated that Tesla pulled the plug on the policy Thursday night. The company web page that formerly spelled it out is now a redirect to a general support page (although a Google search for ""Tesla return policy"" yields a blurb of the old promise as its first result).The Electrek article's sources said that customers having issues with new cars and who desire a refund will instead be directed to Tesla's service department.Image source: Tesla.Under the old policy, owners of new cars could return their vehicles as long as the cars showed no damage and had fewer than 1,000 miles on the odometer. Tesla has not yet made any formal announcement about the status of the policy, nor has it responded to the article.The company has featured prominently in headlines over the past week. On Monday, it cut the price of its premium Model S sedan by $3,000. This was not the first reduction it made in 2020 (an earlier one was enacted in May), and it wasn't the last. A mere two days later, CEO Elon Musk announced in a tweet that the price would be lowered by another $2,570.Although abrupt changes in Tesla's business are the rule rather than the exception, investors might not be too happy with the elimination of that very confident return policy.

222,"Oct 16, 2020 4:02PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGeneral Electric (NYSE:GE) stock has had quite the saga — the company has been in turnaround mode for over three years now.GE has installed two different CEOs, sold off countless divisions, and made all sorts of strategic changes. It has also been through a variety of crises, both external and self-inflicted. Of course, this has made GE stock volatile, with plenty of ups and downs.So, the latest blow probably didn’t come as much of a surprise to shareholders.Last month, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) took an additional step toward disciplinary action against General Electric. While the company has faced plenty of heat from short sellers and credit ratings agencies, government regulators are a newer hazard.Still, GE stock has been able to come out relatively unscathed so far. Shares only fell for a few days, then quickly rebounded. And even in the wake of this added uncertainty, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) came to GE’s side, giving the stock a favorable rating.I’m inclined to agree. Despite GE’s many unresolved concerns, there is still a viable comeback story here.Two weeks ago, the SEC made its regulatory plans regarding GE known. As a result, General Electric issued the following disclosure:“On September 30, 2020, the SEC staff issued a “Wells notice” advising GE that it is considering recommending to the SEC that it bring a civil injunctive action against GE for possible violations of the securities laws. GE has been informed that the issues the SEC staff may recommend that the SEC pursue relate to the historical premium deficiency testing for GE Capital’s run-off insurance operations, as well as GE’s disclosures relating to such run-off insurance operations.”I’ve seen people overreacting to this, so let’s put it in context. A Wells notice doesn’t necessarily mean that the SEC has decided to bring enforcement actions against the company — instead it notifies them of the possibility. As GE notes in its press release, this is not a formal notice of wrongdoing or allegations of such. Further, GE will have a chance to present its case to the SEC before it brings official action against the company.That noted, this is still unequivocally bad news for GE stock. The SEC runs tons of background investigations on companies. It rarely gets to this step — particularly on a company as large and important as GE. This is even the case in the wake of controversies. For example, the SEC took a fairly light touch with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) — Elon Musk got to keep his position as CEO, and a $40 million fine is little more than a slap on the wrist in this context.Meanwhile, GE appears like it may get raked over the coals for events that happened back in 2018 and earlier.It’s not all bad news for General Electric though, despite the government investigation. Goldman Sachs has re-entered the playing field on GE.The famed investment bank had previously stopped coverage of General Electric in 2019, as it was advising that company on potential mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity. In 2019, when it dropped coverage, it merely held a “neutral” rating on GE stock.Now, however, GE’s analyst Joe Ritchie has issued a “buy” rating on GE stock. What’s more, he set an ambitious $10 price target, which represents a little over 25% upside from current share price. Ritchie wrote that the new GE is a “leaner, structurally more productive company with better capital discipline.” As the pandemic ends, Ritchie expects GE to improve its free cash flow generation dramatically.I’ve long made the bull argument for GE stock. There are some great assets at the company — and that hasn’t changed. With Larry Culp running General Electric, the firm now has a capable leader who can unlock the value of GE’s crown jewels.However, this process has been anything but easy. Even now, as 2020 winds down, GE is still paying the price for errors made by previous leadership. The SEC Wells notice — and any subsequent fines or penalties — is not the fault of current management.Still, these problems are painful. It seems every time GE stock is about to turn the corner, some new bad luck hits.But the fundamentals still point to GE’s eventual success. Goldman Sachs agrees, despite critics, skeptics and government scrutiny. As always, it’s not a fun or pleasant experience owning GE stock. However, its resilience in the wake of this latest setback should reassure shareholders.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Ian Bezek has written more than 1,000 articles for InvestorPlace.com and Seeking Alpha.

223,"Oct 16, 2020 1:21PM EDT","By John McCrankNEW YORK, Oct 16 (Reuters) - As a technology-driven rally brings U.S. stock indexes within striking distance of fresh records, concerns that big names are over-extended and thatnew regulation might be coming have some investors diversifying beyond the rally leaders.The S&P 500's five biggest companies, Apple Inc AAPL.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O and Facebook Inc FB.O now account for 28% of the index's weighting and have been responsible for 25% of its earnings, Goldman Sachs said earlier this month.On average, these tech and internet-driven stocks have gained 49.23% this year, compared to a 7% gain for the S&P 500 - and are up 9.6% on average since Sept. 21, versus 6.6% for the S&P 500. They are expected to report strong third-quarter earnings in coming weeks, proving their mettle in a year when the coronavirus pandemic fueled a work-from-home economy while devastating companies linked to sectors like travel, restaurants, and fossil fuels.(Graphic: S&P 500's big tech boost https://tmsnrt.rs/2SUGbw3)Still, some worry that mega-cap tech companies are exposed to factors that may cut their allure in the months ahead. Being long technology is the most crowded trade of all time, according to a recent Bank of America fund manager survey. ""It's all about trying not to have all your eggs in one basket,"" said Laura Kane, head of Americas thematic investing at UBS Global Wealth Management. ""It's about trimming certain exposures and rotating into something else.""UBS analysts have recommended diversifying out of mega-cap tech stocks on signs of an economic recovery and climbing valuations. They urge rebalancing into U.S. semiconductors, which are more sensitive to economic recovery, as well as emerging market value stocks and United Kingdom-based equities.Societe Generale analysts also recently cited a challenging regulatory environment as one reason to diversify out of U.S. tech shares and into Asian ones and European stocks.Regulatory concerns have heightened following a scathing report detailing market power abuses by Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook issued earlier this month by the U.S. House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel. The report has raised concerns that tough new rules and stricter enforcement for big tech companies will follow should Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden win the White House. A potential breakthrough in the search for a COVID-19 vaccine also could also spur bets on shares of economically sensitive value and cyclical stocks that may benefit from a stronger economic recovery, potentially dimming the appeal of tech, Soc Gen analysts said. L1N2H61ZCThe median 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio for the Big 5 tech stocks is 31, while the S&P 500 trades at a 12-month forward PE ratio of 22, according to Refinitiv. Still, they are not as extended as in the dotcom period, with overall profitability, dividends and balance sheet strength in much better shape than 20 years ago. Companies investors will be watching next week as they report third-quarter results include Netflix Inc NFLX.O on Tuesday, Tesla Inc TSLA.O and Verizon Communication Inc VZ.N on Wednesday, and Intel Corp INTC.O on Thursday. Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook report the following week.Many investors still see the big tech names, with their strong balance sheets and financial results, as havens as coronavirus cases continue to climb and the economy struggles with a lack of new fiscal stimulus.""These companies deliver powerful profits,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors. ""People have to keep in mind that the five largest tech companies make more in earnings than the entire Russell 2000 combined, so this isn't the internet bubble.""It might be a good idea to trim some tech exposure if the position has gotten too overweighted, but the sector's gains are largely being driven by fundamentals, said Michael Farr, president of Farr, Miller & Washington LLC.To rotate out of tech because of big gains and some recent volatility would be ""a suckers' trade,"" he added. ""Reports of their demise have been greatly exaggerated,"" he said of the big tech stocks.Graphic: S&P 500's big tech boosthttps://tmsnrt.rs/2SUGbw3(Reporting by John McCrank; Additional reporting by Saqib Ahmed and Ira Iosebashvili; Editing by Richard Chang)((john.mccrank@thomsonreuters.com Twitter @jmccrank; 1 646 223-6643; Reuters Messaging: john.mccrank.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/wall-st-week-ahead-big-tech-nervousness-prompts-calls-to-diversify-2020-10-16

224,"Oct 16, 2020 12:28PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe markets dealt Workhorse (NASDAQ:WKHS) stock some heavy blows after the U.S. Postal Service delayed its decision on awarding a potential $8.1 billion federal contract. Investors are betting big on Workhorse winning the contract, either wholly or partially.Although the cat-and-mouse game will continue, it’s clear investors have already priced in the contract before it’s awarded. Plus, EVs are also red hot this year. When Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the most prominent auto company in the world, ahead of Ford (NYSE:F) and Toyota (NYSE:TM), the writing is on the wall. All of these factors have pushed WKHS stock to unprecedented and frankly unrealistic highs.Although the company has evolved and taken on several forms, it has been in business since 1998. It has never turned a profit and analysts do not expect it to until 2022. Even if the company manages to clinch the contract, there are still question marks regarding how well it can execute the task.That makes the stock a spec play at this stage, banking more on external factors than fundamentals. That makes me wary of the electrically powered delivery and utility vehicle manufacturer at this stage.Don’t get me wrong here. There are plenty of reasons to be bullish on the stock. Workhorse occupies a niche space in the EV industry, has a patent portfolio, and a customer list that includes DHL (OTCMKTS:DPSTF), FedEx (NYSE:FDX), and UPS (NYSE:UPS).Also, Workhorse has closed on $70 million in financing through offering a senior secured convertible note. The company is selling $200 million of its 4% senior secured convertible notes to two institutional lenders. So, plenty of financing here will help in operations. Though the latter comes with a juicy option to convert the notes into stock at $36.14 per share, a premium of 35% over the Oct. 9 closing price.But you get my point. The company has plenty going for it at this stage. However, that doesn’t justify WKHS stock rising almost 1,300% over the last six months.  It’s understandable that the prospect of an $8.1 billion federal contract will send shares soaring. Still, the prospect of getting burned is always omnipresent when you see this kind of share activity.I always like to dig deep into the fundamentals. Analyst estimates point to less than $150 million of sales in 2021. Although that’s expected to be a 574.34% uptick, the absolute numbers are certainly not impressive for a company with a valuation of approximately $2.45 billion.Despite several catalysts, the biggest driver of WKHS stock’s recent surge is the potential USPS contract. The postal service wants to replace the white, right-hand-drive vans with next-generation delivery trucks.In a research note, Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin said that Workhorse is a favorite to win the contract. Roth Capital Partners believes the company is the “best fit” out of the competitors left in the race. The bull case may have to do with Workhorse’s headquarters, Ohio, a swing state. Many analysts are betting the president will award the contract to better his chances of winning his re-election bid.I believe that could factor into the final decision, but it’s certainly not the be-all-end-all reason why Workhorse will get the contract. Still, even if the company receives the contract or a portion of it, it won’t be a straightforward path to the top.Workhorse is not vertically integrated, like its competitors. If it ends up with such a huge contract, it will have to undergo some massive growing pains that will include ramping up production capacity. It’s not that the company cannot do so, but it doesn’t have a history of delivering such large contracts. It will have to outsource large segments of the agreement to others. That will only contribute to Workhorse’s negative margins.If you were an avid InvestorPlace reader, then you probably picked up WKHS stock was about to get hot. Under the circumstances, you made a nice profit, but the moment of truth has arrived. Sometime this month, if the company lands the USPS contract, shares will skyrocket to new heights. If there is a hitch, shares will tank. So, you need to gamble with the money that you can afford to lose.I would advise keeping some funds invested in WKHS stock while taking some of your hard-earned profits and investing them in other, more stable stocks. The company won’t be profitable for a while, and the contract is not a done deal. So, unless you are in for the long haul, this is an excellent opportunity to part with a portion of your stake.If you are willing to take on a bit of risk, then go ahead and keep investing in the stock. There are more signs of the company getting the USPS contract than against, so if you are willing to play the numbers, go right ahead.On the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. Faizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

225,"Oct 16, 2020 12:07PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsYou don’t need to be an expert in tasseography to understand that autonomous driving innovations as a business concept is the future. Honestly, I’m not 100% sure if the technology will become mainstream and practical in my lifetime. However, that’s not going to stop companies like Velodyne Lidar (NASDAQ:VLDR) from forging ahead. Plus, with automakers like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) pumping millions into autonomous research and development, you can see why many are excited about Velodyne stock.First, let’s briefly cover what makes VLDR so special. As I mentioned with my write-up for Gores Metropoulos (NASDAQ:GMHI), which will have a reverse merger with competitor Luminar Technologies, lidar (which stands for light detection and ranging) is an advanced system that utilizes electromagnetic radiation signals to ping off objects. From there, the system calculates distances based on how long the initial signal takes to return.Because the speed of light is constant, lidar systems are incredibly accurate. As well, because the system relies on laser signals, it works better in inclement lighting conditions, where certain environmental factors – such as blazing hot sunlight – can obfuscate camera-based autonomous systems.In fact, a Tesla vehicle crashed into a tractor-trailer in 2016 when its Autopilot feature couldn’t detect the trailer from the bright sky. Because lidar systems actively “touch” surrounding objects, in theory, Velodyne stock is levered to a superior autonomous technology.However, that theory has not necessarily translated well in the investment market. As you can see if you pull up the chart for Velodyne stock, it’s had a wildly choppy ride since its introduction. What’s more perplexing, VLDR really shouldn’t be this volatile.Recently, the company made news when it announced a sales agreement with Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU). According to the deal, Baidu will utilize Velodyne’s Alpha Prime sensors for “autonomous applications.” It should be a big win for Velodyne stock and shares briefly jumped higher.But soon after, VLDR went negative. Overall, the trend has been ugly since early September. Why?Don’t think I’m picking on VLDR. When you pull up the chart for Gores/Luminar, it looks roughly the same. GMHI shares skyrocketed up to mid-September and then promptly cratered. Now, shares are desperately hanging onto a critical support line.In both cases, the science is undoubtedly compelling. Sure, you can get into the argument about which one is better. On paper, it seems as if GMHI may have an edge based on the underlying company’s claims that it has addressed some of the flaws of traditional lidar systems.But even if we were to wholeheartedly take that approach, it still doesn’t explain why the two securities have similar trends. In my opinion, the innovation underlining Velodyne stock (as well as the competition) may be getting ahead of itself.Here’s what is identical about Velodyne and Luminar: they’re not engaged in this space for giggles. They genuinely believe that autonomous driving technology can go mainstream. Logically, then, they’re not just thinking about science but also about scale.But that’s exactly where the problem comes in. What happens when millions of these lidar-armed cars are driving around our cities? As I stated earlier, lidar is an active system so in some way, the emitted lasers interact physically with the environment. And that poses the risk of interference, which could result in unintended consequences.Now, before you engineers start filling up my inbox with hate mail, allow me to caveat the above. Technically, lidar systems can implement randomized pulse modulations so that systems can recognize their own return signals. As well, engineers can integrate algorithms that allow their systems to filter out foreign signals, including lasers from competing lidar-based systems.To put it simply, lidar companies can effectively use different musical instruments playing different notes at different octaves. Theoretically, this should allow lidar systems to “hear” and recognize itself compared to other competing notes.But I’m not sure if this mechanism has been tested in real-world conditions at scale. And I’m pretty sure we’re going to need those tests (and lots of them) before governments allow driverless cars to roam freely. Perhaps the reality of scaled-up autonomous driving is weighing on Velodyne stock.As I mentioned with Luminar, I believe Velodyne stock is best served if the underlying company pursues driver assistance rather than autonomy. After all, with lidar and subsequent improvements to it, you have world-class tracking and distancing accuracy.What you don’t have, though, is true optics. Again, in theory, a camera system like Tesla uses will one day be able to read traffic signs. In contrast, lidar is about data interpretation. Certainly, it can detect objects and predict their movements with uncanny accuracy. But it’s not going to recognize a detour sign, only that a sign exists.Thus, lidar is much more practical as a driver assistance platform. But that’s not a sexy narrative for Velodyne stock. Still, I wouldn’t be against a small, speculative position in VLDR because innovations are constantly sprouting up. Just be aware that at some point, the science might hit a wall as the infrastructure struggles to keep up.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

226,"Oct 16, 2020 9:00AM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs Workhorse Group (NASDAQ:WKHS) makes a go of it in the electrical vehicle market, the months ahead will present a double-sided litmus test, both for the Ohio-based company and the EV sector itself. Electrical vehicle manufacture remains in its infancy; meanwhile we as investors must ask whether WKHS stock will likewise mature — and the company develop a track record for delivering reliable vehicles at a handsome profit.This compound question sure as hell beats all those mediocre puns that must be floating around. You know: Will Workhorse live up to its name? Does it have “horse” power? Will this investment “work?” Is Workhorse a thoroughbred? Or a nag? I want to gag. But I suppose it’s better than asking whether that pantyhose stock will give you a run for your money.So, let’s cross-pollinate the verbiage and see whether Workhorse has legs to run (uh oh). Or wheels. Whatever. I do know this: A month ago I wrote, “WKHS stock is way overvalued, of that there’s no question. But this may be one of the better bets you’ll make in 2020.”So how’d I do? Time to find out.Back on Sept. 11, when last I examined Workhorse Group for InvestorPlace readers, its stock sold for $23.69 per share. It’s actually dipped a wee tad since then — it now fetches $22.90 — so the real issue lies in what’s changed and what hasn’t.What made me cautious then remains true today. No matter how many Robinhood lemmings, uh, investors chase this stock like a Powerball ticket — and that number catapulted to 132,000 as of mid-August — the fundamentals simply aren’t there. Call me a value investing nerd, but as Cyndi Lauper once sang, nerds just want to have fun…damentals.Workhorse is far from profitable and lately there’s been a fashionable term attached to that: “pre-revenue.” By another name, it’s “spin to win.” The only thing “pre-revenue” is good for, if that, is buying pre-ice cream at the pre-convenience store in the pre-strip mall. Fab! Or maybe “pre-fab” is more like it.Yet it’s inevitable, and undeniable, that EV manufacturers need time to ramp up just about everything from manufacturing plants, to distribution, to marketing and sales teams. It’s still risky, I contend, to bet on the butterfly when it’s still aching to bust out of the cocoon. But WKHS stock may be — emphasis on may be — a different story. Maybe. Why?First off, Workhorse was founded by Stephen Burns (not to be confused with the former “Blue’s Clues” host, though I suppose that’s highly unlikely). And for those paying attention, Burns is making a dynamic, downright exciting play with his new EV company, Lordstown Motors. It occupies the massive plant abandoned by General Motors (NYSE:GM) in March 2019. Everyone’s rooting for Burns’ venture, including Donald Trump. Meanwhile, Lordstown’s reverse merger with DiamondPeak Holdings (NASDAQ:DPHC) could close as early as Oct. 22.Burns may be gone from Workhorse’s day-to-day operations, but he left behind a company that remains on something of an upswing. It reported first quarter earnings per share of 6 cents per share—woohoo, a profit! It caught Wall Street analysts, who were expecting a loss, off guard. Beyond this, Lordstown owns 10% of the company, and Workhorse announced on Oct. 12 that it has raised $200 million to increase and accelerate production. Can you spell “vrrrroooooom”?But just months ago in the second quarter, the positive earnings turned south. WKHS stock reported a loss of 12 cents per share, which neither beat nor fell short of expectations. All eyes, then, will (or should) be on the next earnings report. Workhorse isn’t expected to release that until Nov. 13, though this will likely offer no occasion to break out the bubbly. Quarterly per-share losses are forecast all the way through Sept. 21.And yet, InvestorPlace compadre Josh Enomoto wrote just days ago that WKHS stock has benefitted greatly from the novel coronavirus pandemic — and could even more so into 2021. He reasons that aversion to brick-and-mortar shopping will create a robust demand for delivery vehicles, which happens to be Workhorse’s stock and trade.It’s a fascinating argument. What’s more, I always urge investors to look at a stock in terms of broader contexts, whether related to sector or socioeconomic factors. Still I wonder if this is long-shot reasoning. There are plenty of gas-powered van vendors out there, too, and they don’t need to scale up. Meanwhile, we have an untested theoretical as to whether or how Workhorse can meet any flood of demand.So, with the stock having little movement, the Robinhood investor honeymoon on a short-term wane, and four more projected quarters of loss, I’m going to stay put where I stayed put last month. Is WKHS stock still a good bet? Probably. But as I wrote then: “Watch your money closely, pay attention to the news…and ask investors in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), what it’s like to develop nerves of steel.”So there you go, Workhorse fans. Other than my going a little balder and getting a little fatter, nothing else here has changed.On the date of publication, Lou Carlozo did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.The post Workhorse Group Is Still a Work In Progress appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/workhorse-group-is-still-a-work-in-progress-2020-10-16

227,"Oct 16, 2020 6:31AM EDT","Even after a 4-for-1 stock split, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is trading at over $120 per share in October. That's not an astronomical price tag, but it's high enough to be out of reach for many novice investors who want a piece of the iPhone maker. Fortunately, there is a work-around. It's called fractional investing, and you can use it to buy into Apple for less than $1.Fractional investing is the practice of buying stock or fund shares in units of less than one. If you wanted to own Apple, for example, you could invest $15 for about 0.125 shares -- instead of handing over $120 for a whole single share.Image source: Getty Images.Your fractional share position would function much like any other stock holding. Its value would move up and down with the stock price, your share count would be proportionally affected by any stock splits, and you'd earn fractional dividends. Your 0.125 shares of Apple might be worth $15 today and $15.50 tomorrow, for example. And if you had owned the 0.125 shares before the 4-for-1 Apple stock split earlier this year, your share count would have increased fourfold to 0.5 shares after the split. Going forward, based on that share count, you'd be entitled to 50% of the tech giant's next dividend.Fractional investing is made possible by your brokerage rather than the actual stock exchange. Brokerages that offer fractional investing have to purchase shares in whole units and then divvy them up in fractional pieces as customers request them. Since the brokerage manages the process, the brokerage gets to set the rules. And that means certain aspects of fractional investing will vary based on which brokerage you use.Generally, brokerages do not charge commissions or trading fees on fractional buys, but the similarities often end there. Four areas to clarify with your prospective fractional investing broker are minimum buys, stock selection, voting rights, and liquidity.Minimum dollar amounts on fractional buys can range from $0.01 to $5. Investing app Stash has no minimum buy-in on shares priced at $1,000 or less, though you do have to spend at least $0.05 if the share price is $1,000 or greater. Fidelity and Robinhood allow you to make fractional purchases with as little as $1, which would get you about 0.008 shares of Apple. Charles Schwab's minimum buy is $5.Your choice of stocks will differ by brokerage, too. Schwab offers fractional shares only for companies in the S&P 500 index. That's not an issue if you're investing in Apple, but it's deal breaker if you want fractional shares of Tesla, which is not currently part of the S&P 500. Other brokerages have broader catalogs available. Fidelity allows fractional buys on 7,000 different stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), while Stash maintains a browsable directory of 100s of stocks and ETFs that you can buy fractionally.Your fractional position may or may not come with shareholder voting rights. Robinhood, for example, allows you voting rights based on your percentage ownership. But Stash gives you proportional voting rights only if you own at least one full share. That means you can vote if you own 1.1 shares of Apple, but not if your share count is 0.5.Your fractional shares may have less liquidity, too. The brokerage manages the aggregate fractional shares owned by its customers, and it benefits from keeping that cumulative share count as close to a whole number as possible. That could mean delays in having your orders filled if the brokerage waits for fractional orders to net out near a whole number. Alternatively, your brokerage may charge you to sell your fractional shares, a practice followed by Schwab.Also, you likely can't transfer your fractional shares to another brokerage. You'd have to sell first and then transfer the cash.Buying a fractional position in Apple for $5 is a safer move than purchasing whole shares of a downtrodden penny stock for the same amount. But it's not so safe that you can overlook the importance of diversification. If you're going to invest in individual stocks even fractionally, look to build a portfolio with at least 20 different positions. That way, you only have 5% of your money tied up in any single company.If 20 individual positions blows your investment budget, consider fractional shares of an ETF instead. Any S&P 500 ETF, such as Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, will give you a slice of Apple, along with some 500 other companies that make up the index. That's instant diversification across the largest public companies in the country -- for the price of a penny stock.Fractional shares can be your ticket to investing on a budget. Set yourself up for success by clarifying the rules at your brokerage first and then taking steps to diversify even your tiniest positions.10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

229,"Oct 16, 2020 4:37AM EDT","By Hyunjoo Jin and Heekyong YangSEOUL, Oct 16 (Reuters) - LG Chem 051910.KS, the world's top electric vehicle (EV) battery maker, is in talks with a ""couple"" of automakers to create joint ventures to produce automotive batteries, Chief Executive Officer Hak Cheol Shin told Reuters on Friday.LG Chem is already moving ahead with battery joint ventures with GM GM.N and Geely 0175.HK and hopes to expand to other car makers, Shin said, without elaborating.""Our joint ventures with Geely and GM have been already announced, and we have ongoing discussions with a couple of other automakers,"" he said.The South Korean company currently supplies batteries from its Nanjing, China, factory for Model 3 vehicles built at Tesla's Shanghai plant.""We have started supplying to Tesla in earnest, and this is the beginning of a good partnership and we hope to expand the partnership,"" he said.“We are in talks to expand cooperation with almost all automakers, and Tesla is one of them,” he said.However, Shin added that Tesla is not one of the companies LG Chem is discussing joint ventures with at this point.LG Chem shares, which rallied earlier this year, have lost steam on its plan to split off its battery business and fire risks associated with its batteries supplied for Hyundai Motor's Kona and GM's Bolt.Shin defended the plan to separate the battery business as necessary to fund large-scale investments in factory expansion. The unit will first become a wholly-owned subsidiary tentatively named LG Energy Solutions and then up to 30% of the company may be listed in an initial offering in about a year. ""To maintain our number one position in the face of rising competition from Chinese firms and others, we need to pour capital into battery production and research,"" he said.LG Chem is looking for a site to build a new factory in Europe, as it plans to more than double its global car battery capacity to 260 gigawatt hours (GWh) by 2023, from 120 GWh this year.To tackle the concerns around battery safety, Shin said that LG Chem has formed a task force with Hyundai Motor 005380.KS and the South Korean government to find the root cause of the battery fires in the Kona EV.South Korea's transport ministry said Hyundai will recall the Kona EV because of possible faulty manufacturing of its battery cells that could pose a fire risk. However, LG Chem denies that faulty battery cells were the cause of the fires and the exact cause had not been determined.LG Chem is also looking at building new petrochemical production facilities in the United States and Southeast Asia to drive growth for its mainstay petrochemicals business, Shin said.""We see the future of LG Chem would be bright after the split-off,"" he said.(Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin and Heekyong Yang; Editing by Christian Schmollinger)((hyunjoo.jin@thomsonreuters.com; 82-2-3704-5685; Reuters Messaging: hyunjoo.jin.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ceo-of-top-battery-maker-lg-chem-discloses-jv-talks-defends-split-off-2020-10-16

230,"Oct 16, 2020 3:13AM EDT","Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock is up by about 5x year-to-date. While Tesla’s fundamentals have improved in recent quarters- with margins and deliveries trending higher, much of the stock price gains have come from the expansion of Tesla’s valuation multiple. Investors are betting that Tesla’s lead in the EV and self-driving software space – two of the most powerful trends in the auto market – will help it shape the future of transportation. However, Tesla’s stock has a considerable downside if this story doesn’t play out. Below, we outline a scenario that could see Tesla stock decline by about 65% from current levels by the year 2023 – driven by stronger competition from mainstream automakers, the emergence of a strong challenger in the self-driving space, or weaker than expected sales of Tesla’s new models. While our scenario doesn’t assume that Tesla’s Revenues will decline in the near-term, even slower growth or weaker than expected margin expansion due to the above factors could cause investors to rethink Tesla’s valuation multiple, impacting the stock.We spell out more details in our interactive dashboard analysis on Tesla Downside.

Firstly, the barriers to entry in the EV market are not really high. Mainstream and luxury auto companies – which already have much of the engineering and manufacturing capabilities – could partner with technology majors for self-driving and other connected capabilities and launch more compelling EVs,  potentially reducing interest in Tesla’s cars. Secondly, Tesla’s Chinese business – which has been the biggest driver of its growth (accounting for about a third of Tesla’s Q2 deliveries) could also pose a risk considering frosty relations between the U.S. and China. (Trump’s China Posture Is Scary For Tesla) Moreover, there is also a risk that Tesla’s upcoming vehicles such as the Cybertruck may not be as well received. For perspective, the Model Y – which was launched earlier this year apparently hasn’t sold as well as initially expected, with Tesla reducing the vehicle’s pricing a few months after launch. If Tesla’s Deliveries grow at a slower pace from about 370k in 2019 to 740k vehicles by 2023 (with the growth rate declining from around 50% in 2019 to 10% in 2023) and Average Selling Prices decline from about $59k in 2019 to about $50k by 2020, Tesla’s Revenues would grow from around $30 billion in 2020 to about $44 billion by 2023.  Tesla’s Net MarginsTesla’s Margins are likely to rise to about 6% in 2020, up from negative levels in 2019 and investors are counting on the company to post industry-leading Net Margins in the near future, driven by its autonomous driving software sales, battery advancements, and greater scale. However, if Tesla’s lead in self-driving is  challenged by the major tech players such as Google – which could eventually follow a model similar to Android to license out its system – or other tech majors who have the capital and expertise in areas such as Artificial Intelligence, this could limit Tesla’s ability to drive software sales and margins. (Where Does Tesla Stand Versus Google & Others In Self Driving) Moreover, if other manufacturers are able to cut down battery costs to levels similar to Tesla’s via a greater scale or the availability of new technologies, this could also limit Tesla’s ability to boost margins. If Tesla’s Margin Expansion slows, with Net Margins rising from around 6% in 2020 to just about 9% in 2023, Net Income would grow from around $1.8 billion in 2020 to about $4 billion by 2023.

Tesla’s valuation multiple stands at about 225x based on projected 2020 results. This compares to an average of about 15x for the Auto & Truck industry, 13x for Toyota – the largest and most efficient automaker, and about 11x for GM in 2019. If Tesla’s P/E multiple declines to about 35x – well below its present levels although ahead of other automakers – the company could be valued at a market cap of roughly $145 billion or about $150 per share by 2023, based on a Net Income of about $4 billion in 2023.What if you’re looking for a more balanced portfolio instead?

233,"Oct 15, 2020 8:36PM EDT","For the second time in a matter of only days, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is reducing the price of its Model S sedan. That's according to the company's colorful CEO Elon Musk, who announced this in a Wednesday afternoon tweet, reading in its entirety:The gauntlet has been thrown down! The prophecy will be fulfilled. Model S price changes to $69,420 tonight.The contest Musk appears to be referring to is with Lucid Motors, a privately held rival whose CEO and CTO is one-time Tesla executive Peter Rawlinson. Earlier on Wednesday, Lucid announced that the starting price of its upcoming Lucid Air sedan would be $69,900, once a federal tax rebate kicks in.Image source: TeslaIn what's likely not a coincidence, Rawlinson's position at Tesla was vice president and chief engineer for Model S, according to his LinkedIn page.Musk's pronouncement marks the second time this week the sticker price of the Model S has been lowered. It was first cut from $74,990 to $71,990.Lucid Air has not yet reacted to or made a formal statement about Musk's pronouncement.The Model S is one of the better-established electric vehicles (EVs) on the market. It first rolled out of Tesla factories in 2012. Yet its positioning as a premium car limits its potential customer base -- in Q3, for example, the company delivered 15,200 Model S and its similarly premium Model X SUV. By comparison, the more budget-priced Model 3 sedan and the Model Y SUV combined for 124,100 deliveries.Few investors are happy with price cuts.

234,"Oct 15, 2020 1:50PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBack in July, I said the biggest risk for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) investors wasn’t a Tesla stock crash, but that the bubble would result in 10 to 15 years of underperformance.The idea behind that prediction is that Tesla is not a scam —  it’s just extremely overvalued, gaining about 750% in the past year. Eventually, the company’s actual growth will likely catch up to its stock price. But investors could be disappointed by how long that realignment may take.In a new research note, Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill says he can’t justify the current Tesla stock valuation, even by looking 10 years into the future.Many Tesla bulls I talk to seem to approach Tesla (and CEO Elon Musk) with more blind faith than objective analysis. On the flipside, the bears alleging that Tesla is a fraud are even more unhinged.In reality, Tesla is a great growth company. And that great company just happens to have a stock price that is absolutely ridiculous.This phenomenon is not unique to Tesla. I’ve previously compared the company to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) during the height of the dot-com bubble back in 2000. From 2000 to 2015, Microsoft reported impressive revenue growth. Yet it took more than 15 years for its business to grow into its absurd bubble valuation.Gill doesn’t doubt Tesla’s growth story even a little bit. In fact, he is calling for 21% compound annual revenue growth for the company through 2029. In a Needham analyst note from Oct. 12, he says:“Based on our estimates, this would imply Tesla becomes the #1 car manufacturer by units sold at approximately 4 million cares (based on today’s levels) at ~$41k blended ASP (approx $35k equivalent today).”Needham is also projecting 35% CAGR in free cash flow for Tesla over the next decade. But Gill still can’t find the upside for Tesla stock.“Our 2029 base case implies a share price of $365 or 14% downside at current levels when discounting 10-years of FCF back to today’s levels,” he concludes.Understandably, Needham has an “underperform” rating for Tesla stock.Yes, Tesla has an excellent long-term growth opportunity. But the 2020 electric vehicle bubble has made the company untouchable as an investment.Tesla stock investors hate to compare the stock to other auto stocks. Fine. They say the company is closer to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which started by selling hardware and transitioned its growth story to a services model. Fine. Let’s look back at Apple’s history.In the past 20 years, Apple’s revenue has gone up more than 4,000%. That’s some pretty crazy long-term growth. During that 20-year stretch, Apple stock’s single best year was an over 200% gain back in 2004. Tesla is up 772% in the past year alone. I hate to break it to Tesla investors, but Apple reported 39% revenue growth in 2004.  Tesla’s revenue growth in the last four quarters has been 3%.In fact, Gill points out that pretty much the only thing that has changed about the company’s profile in the past year has been its share price. He points out that the cost to buy Tesla increased by 386% from July 2019 to March 2020. During that stretch, consensus analyst estimates for 2021 Tesla revenue actually dropped by 13%.I wish all the best for Elon Musk and Tesla stock investors. The company will likely gain a significant share of the global auto market over the next decade by putting up some world-class growth numbers. But its stock price will also lag the S&P 500 during that period.Share price can become detached from reality in the short-term. Just ask investors who bought Microsoft shares back in 2000. However, fundamentals always have a way of catching up to a stock — even if it takes a while.As Laura Gonzalez, associate professor of finance at California State University, Long Beach, wrote in an email to InvestorPlace:“Tesla has overcome numerous obstacles and there is demand for alternatives to traditional automobiles. However, in order to maintain a high price-to-book ratio charismatic leadership needs to be paired with expectations of stability based on predictable behavior. ”It’s great that so many young investors are learning about stocks by investing in the brands they love. I just hope that they don’t miss out on the 10 to 15 years of gains by buying Tesla stock at a bubble valuation.On the date of publication, Wayne Duggan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.Wayne Duggan has been a U.S. News & World Report Investing contributor since 2016 and is a staff writer at Benzinga, where he has written more than 7,000 articles.

235,"Oct 15, 2020 12:03PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsVelodyne’s (NASDAQ:VLDR) LIDAR technology is well-positioned to become widespread. The company’s offerings already are in high demand and long-term investors should buy Velodyne stock.Velodyne’s annual revenue is estimated to have reached $100 million. This means LIDAR is widely deployed in automobiles. And both advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and fully autonomous vehicles are poised to proliferate in coming years. Thus, Velodyne’s financial results are set to surge long term.Velodyne CEO Anand Gopalan told Bloomberg that the company’s customers have “tremendous momentum” when it comes to commercializing their ADAS and autonomous-driving systems. Indeed, the company went from three deals at the beginning of 2020 to 18 on Aug. 1, and it expects its top line to jump 60% every year going forward. By 2024, Velodyne will generate revenue of $680 million, Gopalan, the CEO, estimated.Those figures indicate that the demand for LIDAR is jumping and that the technology will become widely used by the middle of this decade.Providing further evidence of that view, Bloomberg analyst Andrew Grant said “we believe [LIDAR] will be an important sensor for achieving level four highly autonomous vehicles.” He added that the technology can also be incorporated into trucks and robotics.On Oct. 5, Ford (NYSE:F) announced that it had obtained 13.06 million shares of Velodyne stock, giving it  7.6% ownership of the LIDAR maker. Moreover, Chinese internet search giant Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), announced a three-year deal with Velodyne. Under the agreement, Baidu will use Velodyne’s “Alpha Prime sensors … for autonomous applications,” Velodyne announced.According to Velodyne, Baidu “selected the Alpha Prime for its range, resolution and field of view that collectively address the high-performance requirements for autonomous vehicles.” In a recent article, the company added that the technology:“enables autonomous operation within a broad range of settings, including urban and highway environments. It provides exceptional detection of dark or low reflectance objects at long distances, such as tires, dark vehicles, low reflectivity pavement and low visibility pedestrians.”Finally, in October 2019, Velodyne announced that it would collaborate with South Korea’s Hyundai Mobis. The companies intend “to launch a new lidar-based ADAS that integrates Velodyne lidar technology and Hyundai Mobis cognitive software.” Hyundai Mobis says that it’s the world’s seventh largest auto parts maker with over 32,000 employees.Given the deal with Baidu, the large investment by Ford and the partnership with Hyundai Mobis, I think it’s crystal clear that Velodyne has developed very strong and extremely useful LIDAR products. Otherwise those large companies would have dealt with one of the other LIDAR developers.Grant, Bloomberg’s analyst, says the timeline for the launch of autonomous vehicles is “uncertain.” He only “expects roughly 135,000 lidar-equipped robotaxis to hit public roads globally by 2028.”Even Velodyne’s CEO only anticipates “a limited rollout” of robotaxis beginning in 2022.But Elon Musk, Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO, said earlier this month that he expects the company to begin launching its “full self-driving” system on Oct. 20. And as I’ve pointed out in previous columns, Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Waymo is already providing fully autonomous robotaxis in a Phoenix suburb.Further, as I’ve also noted in the past, autonomous vehicles are already being used to deliver products. And this trend has accelerated during the novel coronavirus pandemic, Reuters reported in April. Specifically, the news service stated that “Self-driving cars, trucks, sidewalk robots and shuttles are rolling out of the labs and parking garages and onto American streets to help deliver groceries, meals, and medical supplies.”With Waymo and apparently Tesla already moving to full autonomy, I believe that many automakers will unveil the technology on a massive scale way sooner than 2028. And autonomous vehicles are already being used for deliveries fairly regularly. This trend that should surge by leaps and bounds over the next year. Consequently, I expect demand for Velodyne’s products to be much stronger than expected in the coming months and years.In light of the tremendous validation of Velodyne’s products and the strong demand outlook for LIDAR, I recommend that longer-term investors buy the shares.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. Larry has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 13 years.

236,"Oct 15, 2020 10:04AM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlthough electric vehicles capture most of the headlines, the real science underlining this innovation is the battery. The biggest push right now in this sector is the development of the solid-state battery. That’s where Kensington Capital Acquisition (NYSE:KCAC) comes into play. Management claims to have discovered the breakthrough to take EVs to the next level, boosting interest in Kensington Capital stock.If so, Kensington, which plans to initiate a reverse merger with QuantumScape via the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) process, would be an almost miraculous organization. Essentially, the solid-state battery is the holy grail of the EV battery developmental competition. Many automakers are throwing everything they have at this technology.But if KCAC has the keys, you can be darn sure that Kensington Capital stock will fly to the moon.To understand why KCAC has this tremendous upside potential, it’s worth considering the difference between today’s lithium-ion battery and the (hopefully) upcoming solid-state variety. For that, Techcrunch contributor Kirsten Korosec does an excellent job succinctly explaining the distinct factors:Electric vehicles on the road today are equipped with lithium-ion batteries. A battery contains two electrodes. There’s an anode (negative) on one side and a cathode (positive) on the other. An electrolyte sits in the middle and acts as the courier that moves ions between the electrodes when charging and discharging. Solid-state batteries use a solid electrolyte and not a liquid or gel-based electrolyte found in lithium-ion batteries.Developers claim that solid electrolytes have greater energy density, which translates into squeezing more range out of a smaller and lighter battery. Solid electrolytes also are supposed to be better at thermal management, reducing the risk of fire and the reliance on the kinds of cooling systems found in today’s EVs.Put another way, solid-state batteries fulfill the two Ps in PPP, which are physical spacing and performance. As Korosec explains, with the greater energy density of this new battery tech, automakers can have more design and capacity freedom. In addition, the greater range and faster charging capabilities finally makes EVs more realistic as a road to mainstream integration.But the last, price, is where separate merely great companies from unicorns. This brings up a question: Is Kensington Capital stock a unicorn investment?Arguably, before Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) came along, not too many folks appreciated Nikola Tesla the scientist. Today, you can’t hear enough about this reclusive genius and his ultimate goal of providing free energy for the world.Although he never got to finish what would have been a paradigm-shattering invention, future generations of scientists were inspired by his work. In modern times, it’s reasonable to say that throughout much of the world, technology has achieved two-thirds of Tesla’s original vision: we have power and it is physically distributed (almost) everywhere in a convenient format.But it’s not quite what Tesla had in mind. You see, he wanted free (accessible) energy for everyone to enjoy. The last time I checked my utility bill, it wasn’t free (nor was it cheap).And that’s the irony behind Tesla the company’s EVs. On the surface, they feature the convenient physical dimensions of a regular car with overall performance metrics (i.e. acceleration, range, charging time, etc.) that are roughly on par with combustion-engine cars. But the problem here too is price.EVs are not nearly as accessible as they should be. Tesla’s Elon Musk admitted as such; hence, Tesla’s own search for a groundbreaking battery that would truly allow anyone with a job to buy an EV.For me, this is the sticking point regarding Kensington Capital stock. In order to really take KCAC to the moon – and to justify some of the hype train behind this company – its solid-state battery has got to address all three Ps.Interestingly, QuantumScape CEO Jagdeep Singh also signaled that his company must hit the P trifecta. In an interview with Fast Company, Singh said, “The improvement you’re seeing in range is not coming from fundamental improvements in battery technology… What’s happening is people are [installing] bigger and bigger packs.”Exactly. The bullish case for Kensington Capital stock revolves around its underlying battery’s holistic accessibility component. Right now, it’s possible to ramp up overall performance by sacrificing physical spacing (by making the car heavier through brute-force integration) and raising the price.The thing is, anybody can go the brute-force way. But the real genius is the company that can implement these technologies at a cheaper price. In other words, doing more with less. So far, the offering of everything has basically been a scientific impossibility.In my last write-up regarding Kensington Capital stock, I mentioned that you shouldn’t be afraid of being skeptical. Having reanalyzed the case for KCAC, I still feel the same way.Well, maybe not quite the same. Admittedly, when I consider the upside if QuantumScape does deliver its solid-state unicorn battery, I can’t help but feel temptation. After all, if it comes through, KCAC would be a contender for greatest stock in the universe.But “if” is a nasty mistress. Unfortunately, the problem with solid-state batteries is that current working models fail after repeated charging and discharging. That’s something that both the Faraday Institute and Toyota (NYSE:TM) have discovered.Of course, it’s possible that QuantumScape has discovered something that these and other renowned institutions failed to see. But let’s face it – this prospect is highly unlikely. Therefore, Kensington Capital stock is an almost-perfect high-risk, high-reward venture.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The electric vehicle (EV) maker has the “it” factor right now, and its stock is reflecting that. The EV space has been a bit mixed this year, but that has not been the case for Nio.

 The Chinese automaker has pulled the correct levers to get investors excited.  After Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA)explosive move higher, they could taste the potential of Nio. That said, there have been some hiccups in the EV space. Workhorse (NASDAQ:WKHS) — which went public using the now-popular SPAC method — has had quite a bit of volatility. The narrative around Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) has been a total mess lately, with short reports catching a lot of investors off guard. But Tesla and Nio are different. Their businesses and stock prices have momentum. While Tesla’s shares have been wavering a bit over the last few months, keep in mind that its market capitalization had climbed to $475 billion at one point. Enough about the industry, though. What makes Nio special? Have a look at Nio’s daily chart above, which highlights just how strong and orderly the rally has been. Shares erupted off the March and April lows, tripling in June when it set new highs. As if that weren’t enough, Nio then blasted through $10, going from $8 to $16 in just a few trading sessions. The shares have undergone a series of consolidations and breakouts since. The latest breakout came on Wednesday, Oct. 14. Nio continued to trade around the 161.8% extension (for the entire initial range dating back to its IPO in 2018). Nio was also struggling with the $22.50 area. However, it was clear that the buyers were in control, simply biding their time until the next push higher. How do we know that? Look at how tight the range was over the last few trading sessions. Not only did the daily ranges get tighter, but the lows were getting higher as the 10-day moving average continued to nudge Nio upwards. With the breakout in play, bulls will likely be targeting $25 on the upside, followed by the two-times range extension at $26.41. If the stock moves above that, $30 could be on the table. On the downside, the $21.50 to $22.50 level needs to hold as support for the bullish move to remain intact. A close below these marks could create more selling pressure. So why exactly are buyers flocking to Nio? The answer is actually quite simple: because it is growing. There are many companies that have been negatively impacted by the novel coronavirus. There is a large group of companies that can only wish they had positive growth this year, let alone breakeven operations. With a narrowing list of publicly traded companies that are still expanding, growth-oriented investors are forced to choose from a smaller number of holdings. Those with accelerating growth — like Nio — are in an even smaller category. Breaking down stocks like this creates a funnel look, with fewer and fewer stocks remaining as we approach the nozzle. Those stocks command higher premiums, as there is more demand for them. It helps when a stock’s technicals are favorable, as shown above in this case. The stock was upgraded on Oct. 14 by JPMorgan, which gave it a $40 price target. That’s about 66% above its current level. The high target shows how investors are thinking about this name right now. Analysts, on average, expect Nio’s revenue to climb this year by 97%, followed by 75% growth in fiscal 2021. Nio still reports bottom-line losses, but those losses are expected to be cut in half this year. In 2021, analysts’ mean estimates call for another improvement, although the company is still not expected to be profitable. In the third quarter, Nio delivered more than 12,200 cars, up 154.3% year-over-year. Combined with its revenue growth, this is the type of momentum that growth investors are looking for. Lastly, at the beginning of the column, I mentioned that the company is pulling the right levers. For Nio, that meant shoring up its balance sheet. After receiving investments from outside parties, the company’s financial situation has greatly improved. That doesn’t include the secondary offering that the company just completed. Coming into 2020, Nio had total and current assets of 14.6 billion Chinese yuan and 4.9 billion yuan, respectively, while its  cash and equivalents stood at just 974 million yuan. Fast forward to the end of June and Nio has 23.1 billion yuan of total assets, 15.1 billion yuan of current assets and more than 10 billion yuan of cash and equivalents. On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell. The post Nio Stock Is Breaking Out – Here’s How the Chart Looks Now appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nio-stock-is-breaking-out-heres-how-the-chart-looks-now-2020-10-15

239,"Oct 15, 2020 8:25AM EDT","Today’s Big PictureEquities in Asia finished lower across the board today. By mid-day trading, European equities were also down, experiencing their worst session in three weeks, and U.S. futures are well in the red. Investors across the globe are grappling with the news that European governments are tightening restrictions to battle an accelerating second wave of the COVID-19 virus, and hopes for a U.S. fiscal stimulus package before the 2020 presidential election continue to fade. France has imposed curfews, and other European nations are closing schools and cancelling non-emergency surgeries in an attempt to contain the resurgence ahead of the winter season. This morning, London announced new COVID-19 restrictions as the city moves to “high” alert on Friday from the current “medium,” which includes a new rule that residents cannot meet with anyone outside of their household in any indoor setting.We see these restrictions and fading stimulus hopes translating into negative adjustments for current quarter economic activity expectations and suspect this combination will lead to softer than expected December quarter guidance, as companies report their quarterly results in the coming weeks. Adding to the above, today kicks off a two-day summit of European Union leaders and investors will be watching for progress on a Brexit trade deal despite today’s imposed deadline by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.And in case that wasn’t enough, reports suggest the U.S. State Department has submitted a proposal for the Trump administration to add Chinese fintech company Ant Group to the U.S. Entity List, which restricts American companies from doing business with individuals or firms listed. This move comes with just 19 days left until the 2020 US election and reports that President Trump is lagging behind Democratic nominee Joe Biden. Some may see it as saber-rattling, but our concern is it could re-open U.S.-China trade concerns and throw another worry log on an already growing fire.

The better-than-expected increase was aided by a decrease in the labor force participation rate to 64.8% from 64.9%.India saw imports crash a whopping -18.9% YoY in September, an improvement from the -24.2% in August, while exports improved to a mild -0.5% YoY contraction from the prior -8.2%.China’s inflation rate slowed to 1.7% YoY in September from 2.4% in August.

Yesterday the Census reported a record-breaking 1.6 million new business formations in the third quarter. Digging into the details, about 900,000 of those are likely one-person shops, but those that are likely to result in hiring rose a record 79%.We are getting earnings reports from the major national banks, and so far, they point to the first decline in loan growth since 2011. Net interest margins have crashed from around 3% to barely 2%, mostly driven by provisions for loan losses. If the economy rebounds robustly, this may be a case of banks being over-reserved, which would mean a tailwind to performance in the coming quarters. If the economy gets materially worse, that net interest margin will come under further pressure, and provisions could prove to be inadequate.Yesterday’s Producer Price Index came in a tad higher than expected across the board, up 0.5% for PPI (Final Demand) YoY, up 1.2% YoY for Goods ex-food and energy, up 0.93% for Food and down 11.4% for energy.

240,"Oct 15, 2020 8:05AM EDT","After rising 830% over the past 12 months, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) now boasts a $430 billion market capitalization. You'd think the stock couldn't go much higher after such a wild run-up, but a billionaire investor who has held shares of Tesla since it had a market cap of about $40 billion thinks there's still enormous upside to come for this growth stock.The billionaire making this call on Tesla stock is Ron Baron -- the legendary investor who oversees Baron Capital. Baron Capital initially accumulated 1.6 million shares at a split-adjusted cost basis of about $44. Baron has done well with his Tesla stock, to say the least.Image source: Tesla.Baron has been outspoken about his bullishness on Tesla stock since Baron Capital initiated its position. It's not surprising to see him still cheering on Tesla; what's surprising is just how much upside he thinks still remains for the stock.""In the short term, I can't have any clue about what's going to happen,"" Baron said in an interview this week on CNBC's Squawk Box. But he does think that over the long haul, Tesla's market cap will eventually be worth $1 to $2 trillion. ""And with what developments have taken place recently, I think $2 trillion is the right number,"" the investor said.Specifically, Baron thinks that Tesla will compound its sales at about 50% annually in the coming years, leading to an automotive business with sales between $500 billion and $700 billion in annual sales in 10 years -- and that's ""just cars,"" Baron emphasizes. ""Batteries is another unbelievable business, which I'm very excited about,"" Baron added. These results will help Tesla stock double two to three more times over the next 10 years, Baron estimates.If his bullish view pans out and the company is generating about $800 billion in annual revenue in 10 years (assuming $600 billion from automotive and $200 from Tesla's energy business), a 5% net profit margin on this revenue would yield $40 billion of net income. For comparison, Apple has $58 billion of net income and a nearly $2.1 trillion market cap.A $1 to $2 trillion market cap in 10 years is certainly possible if Tesla can actually grow its revenue this rapidly and achieve a net profit margin of 5% or more.Still, investors should be cautious of such bullish forecasts for Tesla's sales. For the automaker to pull this off, it will need to both maintain its leadership in electric vehicles and gain significant market share from other automakers. In addition, Tesla's energy business is still very small -- accounting for just 6% of total sales. Today, Tesla has just $26 billion in annual revenue -- a long way off from $500 billion-plus in sales.Could Tesla be as successful as Ron Baron thinks it will be? It's possible. After all, Tesla's revenue has grown at a rate of 50% annually over the last five years. Further, the investor has certainly made some good calls on Tesla over the last five years, aiding his credibility. Still, investors should consider forecasts like this to be more speculative than informative. Investing is a game of making the most of uncertainties -- and there's a lot of guesswork involved in coming up with how Tesla will grow its revenue to $500 billion-plus over the next 10 years.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

241,"Oct 15, 2020 6:03AM EDT","Data indicates that Robinhood users, who are frequently learning how to invest in stocks, are piling disproportionately into a small number of risky strategies that violate important portfolio composition principles. The most popular stocks on the platform illustrate some clear purchasing trends that have yielded mixed results over the past six months.However, even in those cases that have delivered favorable returns, a more nuanced analysis shows that investors may have taken on too much volatility to justify those gains.Image source: Getty Images.Working from home and volatile market conditions fueled stock market participation in 2020, and Robinhood was one of the main beneficiaries, seeing its active user base grow from 10 million at the start of 2020 to 13 million in June. Robintrack.net, a site that published data from Robinhood's API through August, allowed the public to see which stocks were held by the largest number of account holders. This data didn't weight holdings according to value, but it still gave a great idea of the general trends that have been motivating retail investors and traders.From April through August, the 10 most popular stocks on Robinhood remained largely unchanged. The list is comprised of GoPro (NASDAQ: GPRO), Carnival (NYSE: CCL), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL), Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL), General Electric (NYSE: GE), and Ford Motor (NYSE: F). Since activity started taking off in April, half of the top 10 stocks on Robinhood have been outpaced by indexes that investors can track easily, inexpensively, and in a diversified manner with exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Investors have targeted deep value in airlines Delta and American, while powerful brands GE, Disney, and Microsoft have also generated attention.Among that group, only GE is down over the period, but investors would still have been better off simply owning the market than half of the Robinhood top ten stocks. The long narrative for these five stocks may well come to fruition in the near future, but holders have nonetheless incurred six months of opportunity cost during one of the hottest bull markets of all time.Image source: YCharts.Elsewhere in the Robinhood top ten list, investors are enjoying some high-flying winners, including Tesla, Apple, GoPro, Ford, and Carnival. These were great positions to ride during the current bull market, but the ownership data indicates that the vast majority of Robinhood investors were still holding these stocks without taking all those gains off the table as of August. Holders of these stocks should congratulate themselves on these wins and know that they've outperformed benchmark indexes. However, they should also be aware of associated volatility risks and some absolutely essential portfolio composition principles.Image source: YCharts.Lagging performance for half of the top ten list speaks for itself, and the investing community no doubt wants to see that number higher. Beyond that, it's easy for investors to fall victim to confirmation bias and ignoring process in favor of results when assessing the surging portion of the portfolio.All five stocks in the top ten that delivered outperformance are relatively volatile names with five-year beta values ranging from 1.3 to 1.95. This shouldn't be surprising, because volatile stocks tend to deliver better returns during bull markets. There's absolutely nothing wrong with owning volatile stocks. It's important to have exposure to these sorts of positions in a growth portfolio, because they are engines for gains. However, volatility works both ways, and overweighting these equities can quickly eliminate returns when the market sours. Robinhood users had not exited these positions as of August, so an examination of risk-adjusted returns could be vital for those investors.Long-term investing is based on business fundamentals, stock valuation, and a stock's performance outlook relative to others. Speculation, on the other hand, largely ignores fundamentals by shifting the focus to narrative guesswork and momentum. Speculators sacrifice some control over performance, and they usually rely on short-term market dynamics working in their favor. Meanwhile, fundamental investors know that long-term stock performance will reflect the financial results of the underlying company. Along the way, share values may fluctuate within any short-term window due to market dynamics, and this risk can be quantified with volatility metrics such as beta.As a result, sophisticated investors often analyze returns relative to volatility, thus ensuring that gains aren't simply a result of riskier behavior during advantageous periods. The Sharpe ratio is a popular metric used for this purpose. It's not a flawless metric, but it can shed some light on performance. Indeed, Robinhood's highfliers look somewhat less exciting in this light. GoPro's 1.95 Sharpe ratio and Carnivals' 0.78 are outstripped by 2.98 for the S&P. Tesla's 3.34 is almost identical to that of the NASDAQ. Ford and Apple still look to have been worth the volatility at 3.91 and 3.41 respectively, but the gap between those stocks and simple index fund is much more narrow once returns are risk-adjusted Hopefully, the swelling number of Robinhood accounts represent the speculative or playful portion of users' overall financial plans. If these are their primary equity holdings, they would be well-served realize some gains, diversify and consider the role of volatility in whatever returns they've delivered so far.10 stocks we like better than WalmartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

242,"Oct 15, 2020 1:23AM EDT","Electric vehicle stocks have had a solid year, as investors put a premium on growth stocks while betting that the disruption caused by Covid-19 could make the shift to EVs harder for mainstream automakers. While Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock has soared by about 5x this year, smaller players have benefited as well. China-based Luxury electric car maker Nio (NYSE: NIO) has seen its stock price soar by almost 6x year-to-date. How do Tesla and Nio compare? While both companies trade at a similar valuation, with a price-to-sales multiple of about 13.5x based on projected 2020 Revenue, Nio is growing more quickly, but Tesla might be the safer bet. Our analysis How Does Nio Compare With Tesla? has more underlying numbers, parts of which are summarized below.Nio, which was founded in 2014, currently offers three premium electric SUVs, ES8, ES6, and EC6, which are priced starting at about $50k. Nio delivered close to 20.5k cars in 2019, marking an 81% year-over-year increase and we expect the number to grow by about 85% this year. In comparison, Tesla’s deliveries grew by 50% last year to 368k vehicles and we expect the number to rise by about 29% in 2020, driven by the launch of its Model Y and the opening of its Chinese factory. Nio is in the earlier phases of growth with revenue expanding 56% last year, with growth likely to pick up to over 90% in 2020. Tesla sales grew by just 15% last year and could potentially pick up to 30% in 2020. Nio’s Net Margins remained deeply negative over 2019, at -146%, with Gross Margins also remaining in the red. Things are getting better as sales ramp-up, as Gross Margins jumped from -12.2% in Q1 2020 to about to 8.4% in Q2 2020 and Net Margins are also likely to improve significantly in the near-term.  Tesla, on the other hand, is expected to post Net Margins of over 5% this year, driven by improved deliveries, higher regulatory credit sales, and potentially higher software sales.Tesla Is The Safer BetOverall, while Nio’s faster recent growth and unique innovations such as Battery as a Service (BaaS) – which allows customers to subscribe for car batteries, rather than paying for them upfront – are no doubt interesting, we think it remains a riskier investment compared to Tesla. Nio is focused on the Chinese EV market, which is extremely competitive, with several hundred players. Scaling up production quickly is also not going to be an easy task for Nio. The company has also faced quality challenges in the past – last year it recalled about 5,000 vehicles after reports of several fires – and it remains to be seen if it can scale up production while maintaining quality.While Tesla stock also looks somewhat expensive, the company’s well-established and desirable brand, its industry-leading tech and software differentiation, and fast-improving profitability could offer a better margin of safety compared to Nio. Tesla’s business model looks compelling, and margins are poised to rise further driven by declining battery costs, improved self-driving capabilities – which could drive software sales, and better operating leverage.What if you’re looking for a more balanced portfolio instead? Here’s a high-quality portfolio to beat the market, with over 100% return since 2016, versus 50% for the S&P 500. Comprised of companies with strong revenue growth, healthy profits, lots of cash, and low risk, it has outperformed the broader market year after year, consistently.See all Trefis Price Estimates and Download Trefis Data hereWhat’s behind Trefis?

243,"Oct 14, 2020 8:31PM EDT","When it comes to Tesla (TSLA), valuation is an unfashionable metric. For the electric car maker, there has been a major disconnect between the fundamentals and the valuation, and now, one analyst is getting to the bottom of it.Needham’s Rajvindra Gill tells clients he has never seen a stock “rise that much that fast with such little regard to past fundamentals.” Shares have skyrocketed 451% year-to-date, compared to the S&P 500’s 8% gain. To this end, he took a look at TSLA’s unprecedented valuation to eliminate the noise surrounding this company.As part of this analysis, Gill asked “three fundamental questions: 1) Have Street estimates actually moved in sympathy with the meteoritic rise in the share price during two critical breakpoints (July 2019 to March 2020 and March 2020 till today)? 2) assuming the long view, what stock price does a 10-year discounted flow analysis (DCF) yield? and 3) in the relative near-term, what are the ranges of share prices when applying leading technology and AI P/E multiples to a range of EPS scenarios?”Looking at these breakpoints, between July 2019 to March 2020, shares appreciated by as much as 386%. At the same time, forward sales and EPS estimates moved sideways or in some cases, actually declined. “This started to create a large disconnect between TSLA stock and its underlying fundamentals,” Gill noted.From March 2020 to the present, even though some estimates such as CY22 non-GAAP EPS grew by 42%, the stock rose by as much as 490%, creating “a further disconnect between the price and the stock's underlying fundamentals,” in Gill’s opinion.Performing a 10-year DCF-based intrinsic value analysis, Gill estimated a total 10-year sales CAGR of 21% to 2029, which would imply that TSLA will become the top car manufacturer by units sold. The conclusion? Gill’s 2029 base case indicates a share price of $365, or 14% downside at current levels when discounting 10-years of free cash flow back to today's levels.As for the multiples-based stock value on CY 2022 estimates, it further demonstrates that shares are overvalued, according to Gill.Expounding on this, the analyst stated, “Tesla bulls argue that the company deserves a multiple that is in the range of leading technology and Artificial Intelligence companies, such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Netflix and NVIDIA, which are growing quickly and profitable, and trade at approximately 35-45x forward EPS. While Tesla has demonstrated sales growth, it has not shown the consistent profitability that warrants such a multiple, in our view.”Even if a “generous leading-technology-firm multiple of 45x-50"" is applied to a bull case EPS estimate of $6.60, the stock price target clocks in at $330, reflecting 24% downside from current levels.Therefore, Gill continues to give TSLA an Underperform (i.e. Sell) rating, without suggesting a specific price target. (To watch Gill’s track record, click here)Turning now to the rest of the Street, other analysts are cautious about TSLA. With 7 Buys, 13 Holds and 10 Sells, the word on the Street is that TSLA is a Hold. At $326.88, the average price target implies 27% downside potential.

247,"Oct 14, 2020 12:59PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAustralian miner Piedmont Lithium (NASDAQ:PLL), which owns a lithium project in North Carolina, has been a hot topic of conversation lately. And why wouldn’t it be? Piedmont Lithium stock has been on a tear and the short sellers must be feeling the pain right about now. The main topic of conversation is Piedmont Lithium’s major deal inked with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). This arrangement could provide Piedmont Lithium with a consistent revenue source for five years — and possibly even a full decade.But I don’t want traders to get the impression that Piedmont Lithium is entirely dependent on one client or one deal. Instead, investors should view this company as a worthy contender in a growing market for lithium.The number of pure-play lithium mining stocks is fairly limited. Piedmont Lithium stock is among the few choices, and its powerful move to the upside could still have room to run.The aforementioned deal with Tesla proved to be a huge catalyst for Piedmont Lithium stock. When that agreement was announced to the public, the share price moved as much as 395% in a single trading session.Prior to that move, Piedmont Lithium stock had been stuck under $10 for a long time. Now it’s highly unlikely that investors will be able to buy the shares below the $10 level.The Piedmont Lithium stock price already touched $50 once in late September. Then, the bulls attempted to push it back to $50 again in early October. It is practically a foregone conclusion that they will make more attempts. And eventually, it will break through that resistance level.Another positive catalyst would be helpful, but it’s probably not necessary. The lithium market is itself strong enough to provide Piedmont Lithium stock with a lasting long-term headwind.Saying that the world will run on lithium in the future might be an exaggeration. However, there’s a kernel of truth to this as lithium remains an underappreciated but essential resource.The global market yields approximately 400,000 tons of lithium annually, according to one estimate. That’s enough lithium, evidently, to provide power to between 2 million and 3 million electric vehicles.Those figures are certainly impressive, but the market is most likely still in its infancy. As Piedmont Lithium reports, the projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for lithium hydroxide demand from 2018 to 2028 is a whopping 36%.Clearly, the demand for lithium will increase in scale as the electric vehicle market gains traction. And it’s not only electric cars, as electric delivery trucks, semis, buses and even ferries will use lithium.You might not have heard the word “spodumene” before. Yet, it could be an essential part of the green energy revolution.Piedmont Lithium’s lithium asset features a unique spodumene-only mineralogy. What exactly does this mean? Well, spodumene concentrate is a lithium ore mineral. In other words, it is a material that companies can extract lithium from for use in important projects like electric vehicles. As Stormcrow Capital President Jon Hykawy once said, “The first question an investor should ask a hard-rock lithium CEO is ‘how much of the lithium reports to spodumene?’”Regarding its chief advantage, research firm McKinsey explained that “Spodumene is [roughly] 15% more cost-effective to produce lithium hydroxide than salt brine.” Hence, when producing the in-demand lithium hydroxide, spodumene offers material cost savings.And, X-ray diffraction analysis confirms that Piedmont Lithium’s ore body has a “pure spodumene nature” with a noted absence of petalite and lepidolite. To put it simply, Piedmont Lithium could be sitting on the mother lode of spodumene without an excess of impurities.The scale and trajectory of the global lithium hydroxide market suggest continued growth. In light of this, the run-up in Piedmont Lithium stock should persist over the long run.On the date of publication, neither Louis Navellier nor the InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article held (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Louis Navellier had an unconventional start, as a grad student who accidentally built a market-beating stock system — with returns rivaling even Warren Buffett.

248,"Oct 14, 2020 12:08PM EDT","Billionaire investor Ron Baron thinks the sky's the limit when it comes to Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) valuation. He sees the electric vehicle (EV) company growing fivefold over the next decade as its car and battery businesses soar.In an interview with CNBC on Wednesday morning, the founder of investment firm Baron Capital Management said: ""I've said for a long time I thought it was going to be $1 [trillion] to $2 trillion. With what developments have taken place recently, I think $2 trillion is the right number. So I think it's five times from here.""A Tesla Model S. Image source: Tesla.Baron says Tesla's valuation has grown 10 times in the past two to three years, but it's only recently that the stock has caught up. He believes car sales will continue to boom, eventually reaching 10 million a year. And he says that the company has an ""unbelievable"" opportunity in batteries, which he suggests could lead to Tesla generating revenue of anywhere between $750 billion to $1 trillion in the next decade. Its valuation, therefore, could triple or quintuple in that time.It's an ambitious forecast; last year, the company sold 367,000 Teslas. But Musk himself has set a sales goal of 20 million cars a year by 2027.Analysts at Deloitte, though, forecast EV sales will reach 31 million in 2030, meaning Tesla would account for one-third to two-thirds of all EVs sold. That seems unrealistic, but if Tesla comes anywhere close to achieving either 10 million or 20 million cars a year, the market could respond in kind. And adding in the battery business, as Baron suggests, could make his valuation-expansion multiples seem not so far afield.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

249,"Oct 14, 2020 12:00PM EDT","Piedmont Lithium (NASDAQ: PLL) shares rushed out of the gate Wednesday morning, rising as much as 15% before settling down to a still-respectable 6.7% gain as of 11:55 a.m. EDT.The stock appears to be responding to a pair of positive articles posted on SeekingAlpha Tuesday afternoon and evening, both of which cited Piedmont's prospective supply deal with Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) as a reason to own the stock.Image source: Getty Images.In the article published Tuesday afternoon, ""Lisbon Stock Picks"" noted that Piedmont is a lithium mining company possessing ""projects in Hallman Beam and Kings Mountain in North Carolina."" Although the company currently has no revenues (the analyst gently describes it as ""pre-feasibility""), Lisbon Stock Picks urges investors to look ahead to a future in which the company might generate $100 million per year in lithium sales, and enjoy a market valuation of as much as $700 million -- versus the $430 million Piedmont fetches today.Separately, writer ""Simple Investment Ideas"" argued that Piedmont's location in the U.S. makes it ""ideally"" located to supply lithium to Tesla, as well as to General Motors and Ford as they ramp up their production of electric vehicles. Simple Investment Ideas posited a $1.1 billion ""net present value"" for the stock.It's not all rainbows and unicorns for Piedmont, however. Simple Investment Ideas, for instance, admitted that ""lithium continues to be a tough business"" plagued by ""low lithium prices"" and noted that the company has multiple larger competitors.In Lisbon Stock Picks' write-up, they noted that Piedmont's putative lithium reserves are presently ""not proved,"" but only ""indicated and inferred."" Moreover, even if the metal is where Piedmont thinks it is, lithium prices are known to swing widely -- the company's pre-feasibility study forecast prices in a range of $400 per ton to $700 per ton.Piedmont's profits would obviously be much better with prices at the top of that range than at the bottom -- but for now, at least, investors seem willing to overlook that risk in the face of positive sentiment about the stock.10 stocks we like better than Piedmont Lithium LimitedWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

250,"Oct 14, 2020 11:53AM EDT","The stock market has seen some volatility in recent weeks, with early September's correction giving way to a big bullish bounce in October. Investors have gotten more optimistic than ever about the prospects for the U.S. economy and for corporate earnings, which are starting to come up for the third quarter this week. After having traded on both sides of the unchanged mark Wednesday morning, most major benchmarks pushed into positive territory by mid-morning. As of shortly before 11 a.m. EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) was up 35 points to 28,715. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) inched higher by 3 points to 3,515, and the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) gained 8 points to 11,873.Electric vehicles have been a hot area for investors to focus on lately, and this morning, NIO (NYSE: NIO) once again captured headlines with some positive comments from analysts. Meanwhile, on the earnings front, big banks continued to give their results. Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) was the latest to report, and investors weren't entirely happy with what they saw.Shares of NIO jumped 17%, adding to its impressive recent performance. The stock is up more than 40% just since late September.Image source: NIO.The latest move higher for NIO came because of an extremely bullish note that analysts at J.P. Morgan shared. J.P. Morgan boosted its rating on the stock from neutral to overweight and dramatically upgraded its price target. The new target of $40 per share is $26 higher than its previous view.The analysts focused on the fact that NIO's home market in China is poised for dramatic growth. In particular, J.P. Morgan sees electric vehicles getting a lot more market share among total vehicles in China, and NIO has a great opportunity to get more of its premium SUVs onto the market as electric vehicles get more popular.Many have focused their attention on Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) as the obvious first-mover in the electric-vehicle space. But others believe that upstarts like NIO have a better shot at long-term gains. With NIO having home-field advantage in China, those looking to invest in electric automakers should at least consider NIO as an alternative -- or supplement -- to Tesla.Elsewhere, bank earnings continued to come in, and Bank of America didn't fare well. The stock was down almost 4% Wednesday morning after the big bank released its third-quarter results.Just a quick look at the news release makes it clear why some shareholders aren't happy. Revenue was down 11% on a 17% drop in net interest income. Lower consumer fees pushed noninterest income 4% lower year over year. Earnings declined considerably from year-ago levels.Yet B of A is still doing a lot of things right. Deposits soared by 23% to $1.7 trillion, reflecting the extent to which millions of Americans are being extremely cautious with their money right now. B of A's capital strength also improved, with its common equity Tier 1 ratio climbing by half a percentage point to 11.9%.B of A is also having success on the investment side of its business. Fees from investment banking relationships jumped 15% year over year. The bank's global wealth and investment management division saw record client balances of $3.1 trillion.With high-growth tech stocks capturing investor attention, it's been hard for B of A and other bank stocks to get much love lately. It'll probably take a full-blown economic recovery to reverse that trend, but with B of A trading well below book value, some value investors continue to salivate over its prospects.10 stocks we like better than Bank of AmericaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

251,"Oct 14, 2020 10:45AM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhen it comes to batteries that power clean-energy technologies, including electric vehicles, lithium-ion is the concept that many investors recognize. For example, those are the batteries that power Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicles, among others. But what about glass battery stocks?As is the case with the broader renewable energy segment, battery technology is evolving and a new concept is emerging that could benefit users and investors: glass batteries. Glass batteries could potentially solve one of the primary issues associated with lithium-ion batteries. That being storage capacity. Bolstering storage capacity is one of the avenues purveyors of renewable energy are leaning on to draw consumers from traditional technologies, including internal combustion engines (ICE). Plus, there are safety benefits that come along with glass batteries.“It is also neither volatile nor flammable, and does not display issues of lithium dendrite growth that plagues li-ion batteries, which can cause short-circuits and present safety hazards,” according to The Driven.For developers, the trick is getting glass batteries into vehicles that are sold commercially and doing so on a basis that’s cost-effective relative to ICE-powered automobiles. That’s not happening now, meaning there’s some risk involved for investors, but there’s also opportunity. With that in mind, here are some glass battery stocks to consider.Albemarle is one of the dominant names in lithium production and ALB stock reflects as much with a year-to-date gain of 31.48%. As one of the kings of the lithium-ion space, Albemarle can leverage that experience in the glass battery arena because lithium will be a key component in the next-generation batteries. In fact, Albemarle stands to be a big winner if glass battery technology takes off because these products with require more lithium than lithium-ion equivalents.Moreover, Albemarle’s glass business sees applications beyond the electrical vehicle space, giving the company avenues to tap into multiple markets.“Specific optical products, i.e. for spectroscopy, use lithium containing additives (lithium carbonate, lithium fluoride, spodumene) in the glass composition,” according to the miner. “Lithia (lithium oxide, released from either lithium carbonate or spodumene) is also used in container glass, flat glass, pharmaceutical glass, specialty glass and fiberglass. These glass products are designed for durability and corrosion resistance or for use at high temperatures where thermal shock resistance is important.”Albemarle also investors solid credit and myriad favorable fundamental opportunities.“Albemarle’s credit profile reflects strong margins, diverse and leading technologies, strong and unique raw material sources, and strong business positions across its bromine and lithium-based portfolio,” according to Moody’s Investors Service. “The ratings also reflect high debt and stressed metrics, and incorporate event risk given the strategic focus to expand its lithium portfolio in step with the fast-growing EV market.”Kensington Capital is one of many special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) appearing this year targeting the electric vehicle industry. For investors, part of the good news is that the blank-check company already has a deal in place in the form of Volkswagen-backed QuantumScape.That company is angling to become a force among suppliers of EV batteries, though it’s focus is on solid state batteries. That qualifies as next-generation battery technology, but KCAC stock is somewhat risky here following an almost 43% plunge from its September highs.Additionally, investors considering the SPAC shares with the intent of holding when the merger with QuantumScape is finalized will likely need to exercise patience because it will be 2028 before the company generates $6.5 billion in revenue. QuantumScape is forecasting commercialization of solid state batteries in 2025.At the end of the day. QuantumScape is a next-generation battery idea and a potentially interesting one that, but it the name could require more patience than many investors are willing to extend.Panasonic is a name familiar to many as a maker of consumer electronics. But it’s also a major supplier to Tesla, putting it front and center in the battery battle. Panasonic operates 13 lines at Tesla’s Nevada gigafactory and said earlier this year that new technology will enable it to bolster density by 5% while reducing cobalt input. The company is hoping to manufacture cobalt-free batteries in a few years, which could reduce costs.Those are feathers in Panasonic’s cap. The company is also growing its next-generation battery footprint, an endeavor it must execute to appease investors. The allure here is easy to comprehend.  In addition to improved density, glass batteries are significant improvements over lithium-ion rivals when it comes to charging times.At its Battery Day a few weeks ago, Tesla said it plans to ramp up purchases from Panasonic, but cautioned that widespread battery improvements will not be seen until 2022. This is mostly positive for Panasonic. But the company needs to find other end markets and large-scale customers for its battery technology, glass or otherwise. Supply shortages could compel Tesla to seek product elsewhere.On the date of publication, Todd Shriber did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.Todd Shriber has been an InvestorPlace contributor since 2014.The post 3 Glass Battery Plays for a Compelling, Nascent Industry appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-glass-battery-plays-for-a-compelling-nascent-industry-2020-10-14

252,"Oct 14, 2020 10:43AM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhat is there to say about oil companies that hasn’t been said yet? All of Wall Street agrees that investing in oil stocks like Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is dumb. That alone is invitation for me to consider XOM stock from the bullish side. When everyone is on the same side of the boat, it’s time to try the other side.We all know the arguments against the use of crude oil. The world has been hating on fossil fuels in light of climate change, so there is renewed interest in ESG investing. XOM stock would be the exact opposite of that. Today we will argue why it’s actually an investment opportunity.I agree that we have to wean ourselves off of using up the planet’s resources just to power it. But I also know that this shift will take decades to even make a dent in demand.The electric vehicle, for example, is not going to replace the internal combustion engine anytime soon. The trend is ongoing but it’s still in its infancy stage. Electric cars have been around since the 1880s, but until Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) all other ventures failed. This is the first car maker to succeed in convincing the masses that it’s doable.Amazingly in 2019 Tesla delivered 370,000 vehicles. But to keep things in perspective, last year the world produced 98 million motor vehicles. In the United States alone the yearly sales rate is almost 20 million cars and trucks.There’s a definite uptrend in alternative energy but it is still a budding movement. It will be years before the math starts to flip to the point where it kills oil companies. It is way too early to declare Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and XOM stock dead. By that logic, cigarette companies would no longer exist. The CDC reports that cigarette smoking kills almost half a million people a year. That’s about one out of every five deaths in the U.S., yet their companies survive and their stocks are still on the Wall Street boards.While the death of its stock is not imminent, the thesis changes for Exxon. This is no longer an upside growth story, at least not for a long while. Because the price of oil fell so far, industry companies have to tighten their spending belts. They already drastically cut their capex, so they stopped pursuing new ventures until this test elapses. This is how they can stay true to their promise to uphold the dividend.And therein lies the thesis. XOM stock is an easy way to earn interest on capital with relatively limited risk.Banks no longer offer investors any meaningful yield, nor do U.S. bonds. The central banks’ loose money policies made sure of that. Overseas it may even cost you money to deposit it, or to lend it out to governments.These inflationary policies force investors to seek yield from riskier assets like stocks. Fixed income has to come from somewhere and XOM stock fits the bill. It currently pays a whopping 10% a year. That’s 20 times more than you can get most anywhere else.It is an attractive proposition especially that the price has already fallen so far. It remains 50% below 2019 levels. After such a sharp correction, the price contains very little froth if at all. Further downside from here will need incrementally bad news. I wrote about this concept in early September and the trade held up OK. Sure, the price fell, but that was during a very sharp market-wide correction. The point is that it found footing and held the pandemic lows.There shouldn’t be much extrinsic risk either. The oil industry is already in shambles so all the cuts and bruises are showing already. Investors have already priced in what surprises they can imagine.On the date of publication, Nicolas Chahine did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.The post Exxon Mobil Stock Is Still a Buy and for the Right Reasons appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/exxon-mobil-stock-is-still-a-buy-and-for-the-right-reasons-2020-10-14

Morgan analyst upgraded the stock in a bullish note. In a note released before the U.S. markets opened on Wednesday, analyst Nick Lai upgraded NIO to overweight from neutral, with a price target of $40, up from $14.Lai wrote that the share of China's light-vehicle market held by ""new energy vehicles"" -- China's catch-all term for hybrids, fuel cell vehicles, and battery-electrics -- is accelerating and will quadruple by 2025. Lai sees that as a rising tide, driven to some extent by Tesla's recent emphasis on the Chinese market, that will lift many boats, including (and perhaps especially) NIO's.NIO began deliveries of its latest model, the sporty EC6, in September.

(The analyst sees Xpeng as a potential mass-market leader in the same segment, with products slotted below NIO's upscale offerings.)

254,"Oct 14, 2020 10:14AM EDT","LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Modesty is not a virtue associated with Tesla founder Elon Musk. Now Volkswagen boss Herbert Diess is trying to match his $426 billion rival’s bluster with a pledge to increase electric-vehicle sales 27-fold by 2025. Still, Musk’s deep battery expertise and the lack of a legacy auto business mean bragging rights ought to remain his to lose.    There are good reasons to suppose Diess can back up his boast. This month the German automaker began deliveries of its first mass-market electric models, the ID.3 car and ID.4 SUV, to displace Tesla and become the world’s dominant electric-vehicle player over the next five years. Both vehicles have broadly similar ranges to Tesla’s Model 3 and Y respectively but are priced some $5000 cheaper. Once depreciation and fuel costs are factored in over its lifetime, the ID.3 is almost one-fifth less expensive than a souped-up version of VW’s combustion engine Golf model. That’s a key affordability rubicon for the Wolfsburg-based company in bringing battery cars to the gas-guzzling masses and bumping up its estimated 7% share of the global EV market.    Counter-intuitively, the new models benefit from good timing. Overall auto sales are contracting, but the number of battery cars sold has increased in several big markets, partly due to generous state subsidies in France, Germany and China. Jefferies reckons sales of global EVs will grow by 5% this year before jumping by more than half in 2021.     And then there’s VW’s head start in the world’s largest car market. While Musk ramps up production at Tesla’s factory in Shanghai, Diess can leverage his existing manufacturing partnerships and dealership networks in China – which bought 4.2 million VW vehicles in 2019 – to flog his latest CO2-neutral models to frugal local drivers. VW projects Chinese demand will gobble up roughly half of EV production in the coming years.    Putting a value on VW’s EV business is tricky given most of the 10 million or so vehicles it sells each year will run on petrol for the foreseeable future. Assume Diess hits his goal of EVs accounting for 8% of overall sales by 2022 – equal to 820,000 vehicles. Apply a multiple of 35 times forward operating profit – or half of Tesla’s multiple – to reflect break-neck growth and the division might be worth 70 billion euros on a standalone basis. That assumes an average vehicle price of 40,000 euros and a 5% operating profit margin, in line with analysts’ estimates. In that scenario, VW’s 73 billion euro market capitalisation could double.But even if Diess hits his sales goals, capturing that value uplift will be tough. First, the automaker has to manage a transition to EVs without diluting more profitable combustion sales. And if VW were to achieve its 2025 ambition of selling 3 million battery cars a year, it means the company would account for one-third of the estimated global market, using Jefferies data. That’s a tall order. And its polluting legacy business would still account for a projected four-fifths of total sales - a major black mark against a company presenting itself as the new standard bearer for so-called “e-mobility”.    Musk, by contrast, has no such worries; all he has to do is flog more Model 3s and Ys. Tesla sold 368,00 vehicles last year, equal to an estimated 23% of the EV market. But Musk’s long-term goal is 20 million vehicles, around double Toyota Motor or VW’s current annual production.    To achieve that, he plans on making EVs even more affordable, with a goal of having a $25,000 car on the market in three years’ time. That would eliminate any price discrepancy between an economy-range combustion car and a battery version, bringing closer Musk’s vision of parking an EV in every driveway.    Reducing production costs is central to that objective and Tesla’s decade and a half of know-how in making batteries – cars’ single most expensive piece of kit - means it can steal a march on the Germans. As a percentage of a Tesla’s average selling price, battery costs have declined from 19.4% to 15% over the past three financial years, according to analysis by Trefis, one-fifth below the industry average. Cheaper batteries also imply higher profitability as the same design can be used on luxury rides which tend to have fatter operating margins. As vehicle production scaled up, Tesla’s profitability has improved: Over the past four quarters the operating margin has increased by 1.3 percentage points to a respectable 5.4%, not far off the 6.7% VW achieved as a group last year.     Musk’s greatest challenge is his own investors’ hubris. Tesla’s gigantic market value suggests it will remain the overwhelmingly dominant EV player over the next decade, despite ferocious competition from VW, as well as Toyota, General Motors, Ford Motor and Nissan Motor. Indeed, Morgan Stanley reckons Tesla’s projected battery capacity by 2030 implies Musk will hit his 20 million annual EVs aim by then, improbably equivalent to approximately the entire sum of projected EV global sales.      Even if he takes just a chunk of a vast market in the future, however, lower build costs can ensure Tesla remains more profitable and more richly valued than rivals transitioning away from petrol. That gives Musk the edge in his duel with Diess.

They bought 335.4 billion roubles ($4.36 billion) worth of shares this year, often replacing foreign investors who were selling Russian assets.Foreigners accounted for about half of stock trading in Moscow and held roughly a third of OFZ government bonds as of September.Three to five new companies are planning to issue shares on the Moscow Exchange in the next few quarters, Denisov said. He did not disclose the names but predicted the number of listings would grow.In recent years, the Moscow Exchange has implemented infrastructure reforms, including new settlement systems and a central securities depository, making local listings more attractive and easing access for individuals amid globally increased market volatility.To attract more clients, the exchange plans to offer early- hours trading on its currency markets in 2021 and will expand the range of foreign blue chips on its stock market.In November, it will offer rouble-denominated shares in several U.S. companies, such as Coca-Cola KO.N and Tesla TSLA.O, taking the overall number of foreign shares it trades to 300 by the end of 2021, Denisov said.($1 = 76.9374 roubles)Moscow exchange sees number of retail clients increasinghttps://tmsnrt.rs/313AEaI(Writing by Andrey Ostroukh; editing by Katya Golubkova, Gerry Doyle, Larry King)((andrey.ostroukh@thomsonreuters.com; +7 495 775 1242;))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/moscow-exchange-bets-on-retail-investors-more-listings-2020-10-14-0

It has acknowledged that some employees were duped into sharing account credentials prior to the hack. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo ordered a probe following the July 15 hack of celebrity Twitter accounts, in an alleged scam that stole more than $118,000 in Bitcoin. Those whose accounts were hacked included U.S. presidential candidate Joe Biden; former President Barack Obama; billionaires Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and Elon Musk; singer Kanye West, and his wife Kim Kardashian, the reality TV star.Lacewell said hackers obtained log-in credentials after calling several employees, pretending to work in Twitter's information technology department, and claiming to be responding to problems with the company's Virtual Private Network, which had become common because employees were working from home.""The extraordinary access the hackers obtained with this simple technique underscores Twitter's cybersecurity vulnerability and the potential for devastating consequences,"" the report said.Twitter's lack at the time of a chief information security officer also made the San Francisco-based company more vulnerable, the report said.Florida prosecutors said Graham Ivan Clark was the mastermind behind the hack, and charged the 17-year-old Tampa resident as an adult with 30 felonies. Clark has pleaded not guilty.

259,"Oct 14, 2020 12:53AM EDT","[10/12/2020] Starlink Preps Public Beta For Parts Of U.S & CanadaLast week, Elon Musk indicated that SpaceX’s satellite-based Internet business, Starlink, had launched enough satellites to start public beta services in parts of the northern U.S. and southern Canada. With the launch of about 60 Starlink satellites last Tuesday, SpaceX will have a total of over 770 satellites in orbit. While the company should be able to offer speeds of about 100 Mbps,  it plans to launch thousands of more satellites, enabling Starlink to provide Internet at speeds of as much as 1 Gbps to much of the populated world. The success of Starlink will be crucial to SpaceX, which has thus far focused on the relatively niche space launch services business. If Starlink Internet service is able to provide a compelling value proposition compared to traditional broadband in terms of both pricing and performance, SpaceX could have a winner on its hands. Below, we provide a scenario of how Starlink could be worth about $30 billion by 2025.[2/12/2020] Starlink Valuation: What Could SpaceX’s Starlink Service Be Worth?SpaceX recently indicated that it could spin off and pursue an IPO for its satellite-based Internet business, Starlink. The Starlink service, which is likely to see operations begin later this year, aims to provide high-speed Internet globally in a cost-effective manner by leveraging a constellation of several thousand satellites. While SpaceX has not given a definitive timeline for an IPO, it has indicated that it could occur within the next few years. According to our analysis, we estimate that Starlink could be worth about $30 billion by 2025, assuming it generates revenues of about $10.4 billion then and is valued using a P/S multiple of about 3x. Below, we provide a breakdown of the opportunity Starlink provides to SpaceX and the potential risks.View our interactive dashboard analysis, ‘Starlink Valuation: What Could SpaceX’s Starlink Service Be Worth?’ to modify our key assumptions to arrive at your own estimate for Starlink’s valuation as it heads towards an IPO. Why Starlink is Crucial To SpaceX Estimating Starlink’s ValuationWe project that Starlink’s first full year of service will be 2021, with coverage spanning a large portion of the global population by 2025. We also expect that Starlink will primarily compete with fixed-line broadband services, as its receivers are expected to be somewhat large for truly portable use (likely pizza-box sized).2.1 Estimating Starlink’s Total User Base2.2 Estimating Starlink’s Revenues 2.3 Estimating Starlink’s Valuation using a P/S Multiple What Are The Key Risks Associated With Starlink? See all Trefis Price Estimates and Download Trefis Data hereWhat’s behind Trefis?

260,"Oct 13, 2020 8:21PM EDT","By Hyunjoo Jin and Joyce LeeSEOUL, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Group appointed Euisun Chung as group chairman on Wednesday, cementing his succession from his octogenarian father in a move likely to give impetus to the world's fifth-largest automaker's push into electric vehicles and flying cars.In the first generational handover at the South Korean automobile giant in 20 years, Chung, 49, said he hoped to lead change at South Korea's second-biggest conglomerate as it battles to stay ahead of the pack in a time of rapid technological innovation in the global auto industry.""Carrying on their bold and innovative legacies, I feel privileged, yet also a sense of great responsibility for opening a new chapter of Hyundai Motor Group,"" Chung said in his inauguration speech to employees.Chung identified autonomous driving, electrification, hydrogen fuel cell, robotics and Urban Air Mobility (UAM) - industry jargon for flying cars - as his initiatives for the future.Hyundai Motor shares were trading up 0.3% after rising as much as 2.5% after the appointment, while the wider market .KS11 was down 0.6%. Kia Motors 000270.KS and Hyundai Mobis 012330.KS fell 1.6% and 1.1%, respectively.Hyundai Motor Group earlier on Wednesday said Chung had been promoted to chairman from executive vice chairman, replacing his father, Mong-Koo Chung, who was made honorary chairman.Key affiliates of Hyundai Motor Group, including Hyundai Motor 005380.KS, endorsed his inauguration unanimously.The appointment makes Chung the latest third-generation leader to take over one of South Korea's family-led conglomerates, which have been credited with lifting the war-stricken country out of poverty since the 1950s.His father took the wheels of the group in 2000 and transformed the company, once mocked for poor vehicle quality, into the world's No.5 automaker.The 82-year-old has been stepping back from frontline operations in recent years, and gave up his board seat in Hyundai Motor earlier this year.Euisun Chung has played an increasingly visible leadership role since September 2018 when he was promoted to executive vice chairman. Hyundai Motor Group invested $1.6 billion in a self-driving technology joint venture with U.S. Aptiv APTV.N, forged a partnership with Uber UBER.N on electric air taxis and invested in ride-hailing firm Grab. In July Chung set a goal to win more than 10% of the global market for battery EVs by 2025. Legacy automakers with similar ambitions face a growing threat from Tesla Inc TSLA.O, which has become the most valuable automaker. Hyundai recently said it plans to recall its top-selling EVs because of battery fire risks. Euisun Chung does not have a major stake in Hyundai Mobis 012330.KS, an affiliate seen as key to control of the group, and is expected to renew the push for ownership restructuring to cement his influence after a previous attempt in 2018 met shareholder opposition. Chung is credited with steering the turnaround of Kia Motors by hiring former Audi designer Peter Schreyer. As vice chairman of Hyundai Motor, he also launched the luxury brand Genesis in 2015.(Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin and Joyce Lee; Editing by Stephen Coates)((hyunjoo.jin@thomsonreuters.com; 82-2-3704-5685; Reuters Messaging: hyunjoo.jin.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/hyundai-motor-heir-takes-over-from-father-after-20-yrs-in-waiting-2020-10-13

261,"Oct 13, 2020 2:58PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAustralia-based mining company Piedmont Lithium (NASDAQ:PLL) got a major shot in the arm when the company confirmed a binding agreement with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Piedmont Lithium stock cheered this development, sending the shares up nearly 400% at one point.Momentum-oriented traders will probably look at this and see a shooting star. However, not everyone necessarily shares this perspective. Indeed, a contrarian outlook might characterize the move in Piedmont Lithium stock as overdone.There’s also the efficient market theory to consider. In other words, it’s entirely possible that all of the good news, including the assumption of higher revenues for Piedmont Lithium going forward, have already been priced into the shares.All of this doesn’t mean that Piedmont Lithium is a bad company. It’s just a cautionary note for overzealous traders with a penchant for chasing runners. Instead of following the crowd, you might want watch, wait and let gravity take over.When a stock shoots up nearly 400% in a single trading session, it will get two different reactions from onlookers. Some folks will claim that this type of price action is massively bullish. Others will expect a pullback.Only time will tell which side of the debate is right. However, it does appear that the bubble in Piedmont Lithium stock might already be bursting.Consider, for one thing, that Piedmont Lithium stock’s 52-week range is $4.00 to $54.50. This suggests that the stock’s run may already be overextended. Furthermore, the bulls attempted to push the stock to $50 and keep it there not just once, but twice.They tried in late September and then again in early October, but failed both times. The implication here is that there are sellers ready and waiting to pounce on Piedmont Lithium stock.It’s also noteworthy that the trailing 12-month earnings per share for Piedmont Lithium stock is -$1. Thus, there appears to be a worrisome divergence between the share price and the company’s actual earnings.There’s an old saying in the markets. That saying is, “Buy the rumor, sell the news.” It’s basically an observation that forward-looking market participants tend to bid up the price of stocks based on developments that aren’t even finalized yet.Then, if the event doesn’t turn out as planned, the stock price can plunge. I’m fearful that this could happen to Piedmont Lithium stock as I suspect that not everyone read the terms of the Tesla agreement carefully.As the press release explains, “The Agreement is conditional upon Tesla and Piedmont agreeing to a start date for spodumene concentrate deliveries between July 2022 and July 2023 based on the development schedules of both parties.”Schedules aren’t always easy to coordinate, and July 2022 is still a long way off. There’s plenty of time for things to fall apart before the time frame negotiations even begin.So, anyone chasing Piedmont Lithium stock at the currently lofty level had better hope that everything works out according to plan. It only takes one problem along the way to grind negotiations to a halt.There’s an awful lot at stake here for Piedmont Lithium. As per the arrangement, roughly one-third of Piedmont Lithium’s planned spodumene concentrate production for the five-year term will be devoted to Tesla.Plus, the sales to Tesla of that same spodumene concentrate “are expected to generate between 10-20% of Piedmont’s total revenues from its proposed integrated mine-to-hydroxide project for the initial five-year term.”To put it bluntly, this deal is all fine and good for Tesla, but it’s make-or-break for Piedmont Lithium. There’s really no “in between” here. Piedmont Lithium stock chasers need to understand that it will be terrible news for this company if the agreement breaks down.When all of the good news has already been priced into a stock, the results for latecomers to the trade can be disastrous.Piedmont Lithium stock could easily keep going up, no doubt. Still, please be careful with this stock. It would only take one piece of bad news for the sellers to come rushing in.On the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.The post Piedmont Lithium Shares May Have Been Lifted Too Fast appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/piedmont-lithium-shares-may-have-been-lifted-too-fast-2020-10-13

263,"Oct 13, 2020 11:39AM EDT","Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) cars just keep getting cheaper. That's good for consumers, but it may not be so good for Elon Musk's electric car company, currently the most valuable automaker in the world. The company has cut the cost of its upscale Model S sedan by $3,000. On Tesla's website, the starting price for the Long Range Plus version is now listed as $71,990, while the souped-up Performance configuration now starts at $91,990. That comes on the heels of a $5,000 price cut in late May.The Tesla Model S: now $3,000 cheaper. Image source: Tesla.The higher-priced Teslas, the Model S and Model X, generate better margins than the lower-priced Model 3 and Model Y. But sales of the S and X have been slumping even as overall sales, especially for the Model 3, have soared. Tesla's overall deliveries hit a quarterly record in Q3 2020, at 139,300. That's a more than 40% increase from Q3 2019, showing that the pandemic and economic recession haven't put a dent in Tesla's popularity. But Model S and X deliveries only made up about 11% of that total, with 15,200 of the higher-priced models delivered during the quarter. That represented about a 7% year-over-year decline. The automaker has been on a price-cutting spree in recent months. In addition to the Model S price cuts, Tesla slashed its Model X pricing by $5,000 in May, and its North American Model 3 pricing by $2,000 at the same time. In July, it cut the price of its Model Y by $3,000. By introducing a lower-priced sedan and crossover SUV, which directly compete with its higher-priced sedan and crossover SUV, Tesla may be its own biggest competitor. Small price cuts seem unlikely to change that dynamic.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

265,"Oct 13, 2020 10:46AM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe law of accelerating returns is a simple yet powerful economic concept, which could easily unlock 1,000%-plus returns in the stock market, help you explain America’s widening wealth gap, and give you the edge in a debate against Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren.Sound too good to be true? It’s not.The law of accelerating returns may be the most important economic concept you’ve never heard of, with broad implications across the stock market, the economy and politics. Better yet, it’s really easy to understand.Our very own Eric Fry — one the world’s top investors who is renowned for his ability to identify global investment trends — believes the law of accelerating returns is one of the most important investment trends of our era, and he’s giving investors an exclusive look into his top stock picks that align with this investment megatrend.But, first, let’s take a deeper look at the law of accelerating returns. Specifically, what is it, and why does it matter?At its core, the law of accelerating returns is the idea that technological change isn’t linear — it’s exponential. That is, the rate at which technology changes, actually accelerates over time. For example, technology changes faster today than it did in 2000, and it changed faster in 2000 than it did in 1950.Futurist Ray Kurzweil first coined the term in 1999. At the time, he was simultaneously inspired and awed by the fact that, in just a few dozen years, U.S. corporations transformed the concept of a computer into a mainstream, widely adopted consumer product. He was similarly enthralled by the internet — which was essentially a science fiction concept in the 1970s — and how one out of every two Americans were using the technology by the turn of the century.After all, it took humans thousands of years to figure out the wheel, stone tools, and fire. Turning computers and the internet into a reality in roughly thirty years was a landmark accomplishment.And yet, by modern standards, that’s almost slow.The 21st Century has been marked by an unprecedented acceleration in technological change. The iPhone wasn’t a thing until 2007. Nor was streaming television or cloud computing. Today, less than 15 years later, everyone has an iPhone, every household subscribes to a streaming service, and every enterprise is on the cloud.And, the craziest part is that this is just the tip of iceberg. This acceleration in technological change will only continue over the next decade and beyond. As it does, it will have huge implications on the stock market, economy and politics.The law of accelerating returns matters because it has profound systemic implications for investors.With respect to the stock market, the law of accelerating returns essentially implies that companies that are aligned with technological change will continue to succeed. Meanwhile, companies that are out-of-sync with technological change will remain sluggish (at best). That’s because as technological change accelerates, companies levered to that change will reap all the rewards. Companies without exposure to that change will be left in the dust.Just look back at the past twenty years for proof. Companies which have been levered to technological change — Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and the iPhone, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and streaming TV, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and e-commerce, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and electric vehicles, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and digital advertising — have seen their revenues, profits, and stock prices soar. Meanwhile, companies without exposure to technological change — General Electric (NYSE:GE), Macy’s (NYSE:M) and Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), for example — have struggled.This trend will persist. The best-performing stocks in the market will be those aligned with accelerating technological change. To see which stocks best align with this investment megatrend, I point readers to Eric Fry’s 1,000% Portfolio.Meanwhile, with respect to the economy, the law of accelerating returns explains America’s widening wealth inequality.Importantly, technological change doesn’t just drive revenue momentum; it also drives cost savings. Amazon figured out how to sell items without needing stores, or even needing employees for those stores. This simultaneous revenue growth and improved efficiency translates into more revenue and market value per employee, which leads to more concentration of wealth among fewer individuals.The more technological change accelerates, the more the few aggregate all the wealth. Thus, the law of accelerating returns is why we have a widening wealth gap problem in the U.S. It’s also why this problem may not get better anytime soon.Lastly, the recurring phenomena of accelerating technological change has profound implications on politics. Bernie Sanders isn’t going to fix the wealth gap problem. Nor is Elizabeth Warren. Or Donald Trump. Their policies all broadly miss the point. The only way to fix the wealth gap is to address the core issue — the law of accelerating returns and the aggregation of those accelerating returns among fewer and fewer individuals.No candidate, save maybe Andrew Yang, is presently tackling this issue.The law of accelerating returns is the most important economic concept you’ve never heard of, with broad and significant implications across the stock market, the economy and politics.Over the next few months, InvestorPlace will be allocating significant resources to helping our readers make better investment decisions that align with this important economic concept, starting with some important observations from one of financial media’s savviest minds — Eric Fry. Fry’s reputation of picking more than forty 1,000% winners — all without using options or other high-risk strategies — speaks for itself.

266,"Oct 13, 2020 10:23AM EDT","Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has taken the investing world by storm this year. Shares of the top electric-vehicle maker have jumped more than 400%, at one point becoming the seventh most valuable American company. Tesla has outperformed expectations during the pandemic, but the real reason for the stock's surge is that investors believe that the EV revolution is entering hyperdrive. Prices and battery power are improving faster than expected, meaning that EVs may soon become cheaper than conventional internal combustion vehicles, leaving the polluting technology in the dust.That development has sparked a rally not just in Tesla, but in EV stocks  more broadly, and with Tesla already at a market value of $400 billion, there are likely better places for investors to look if they want multi-bagging returns. One such option is Niu Technologies (NASDAQ: NIU), a Chinese maker of electric scooters.  Image source: Niu.Founded in 2014, Niu's mission is to redefine urban mobility.  The company has pioneered the market for electric, two-wheeled vehicles in China, and, like Tesla, has focused on the premium end of the market and gradually added lower-end vehicles. This skimming strategy allows a company like Tesla or Niu to build an audience while tapping into the base of customers most willing to pay up for a product. The company currently offers seven different product series, including four e-scooter series, two commuter electric motorcycles, and one performance e-bike. Its top-of-the-line model NQI-GTS is priced at $3,799 in the U.S., with a range of 90 miles and a top speed of 45 miles per hour, enough to handle the typical urban/suburban commute. The recently released, entry-level G0 model, on the other hand, starts at less than $400. Niu's sales have been growing quickly, helping it establish itself as the leader in performance electric scooters.The company reported last week that volume sales jumped 67% in the third quarter to 250,889 -- more than Tesla -- as it bounced back from COVID-19 headwinds earlier in the year and gained traction from the release of the G0 this spring. Management noted that the G0 was its most popular product in the quarter, representing 27.6% of sales. Like the Tesla Model 3, the G0 has a lower retail price and gross margin than Niu's other models, so its sales will have a negative effect on overall revenue growth. Nonetheless, at a low price point, the model will help grow Niu's market share by targeting a budget-minded customer. It can also help build out the company's e-scooter sharing platform, which has been launched in a number of cities around the world, including New York, Amsterdam, and Mexico City. Nearly all of Niu's sales are in China, but its potential as a sharing platform shows that the product could easily catch on globally.Finally, Niu's business also generates solid profits, a rarity for a young tech company. Last year, it posted a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income of $27.3 million on $298.2 million in revenue. Through the first half of 2020, Niu's posted net income of $4.3 million on $124.3 million in revenue. As with electric vehicles, the market for electric scooters is growing fast and has enormous potential. McKinsey forecast that the global micromobility market, which it defines as trips of up to five miles generally on bikes or scooters, will reach as much as $500 billion globally by 2030. The market has attracted attention from ridesharing leaders like Uber and Lyft (as well as a slew of start-ups), which should help drive its expansion.In its quest to tackle that market opportunity, there are a number of tailwinds benefiting Niu. First, China has been the clear leader in electric vehicle sales, and government policy has been highly accommodative of transitioning consumers from gas-burning vehicles to electric ones. Furthermore, in a country where the bicycle was once the vehicle of choice, China's rapid urbanization should help drive demand for electric scooters. They have inherent benefits over cars, as they are cheaper, more fuel-efficient, create less traffic, and are easier to park.Globally, the pandemic has incentivized personal vehicle ownership over public transportation. That trend could persist over the next several quarters as the global economy begins to recover but the virus remains a risk, incentivizing purchases of scooters like Niu's. Finally, the company has a robust product pipeline, as it plans to release at least two new product series or models through at least the next few years so that it can ""cover the full spectrum of the urban mobility solutions."" Niu will benefit from the secular growth and improving technology in the electric vehicle industry, as well.  Niu's growth in the first half of the year was slowed by the pandemic, but the company expects top-line growth of 30% to 45% for the current quarter, and analysts expect growth to accelerate to 63% next year as it rebounds from the crisis. Based on 2021 adjusted earnings per share expectations, the stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) of just 40, a very reasonable valuation and much better than Tesla's P/E of 135.Niu is also worth just $2 billion, meaning the stock could easily double or triple from here, and potentially run much higher, while Tesla stock faces stiffer growth headwinds.With a large and expanding market and rapid growth, Niu looks set to be a big winner if electric vehicles do take over.10 stocks we like better than NIU TechnologiesWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

267,"Oct 13, 2020 8:45AM EDT","Adds background, updates sharesOct 13 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O said on Tuesday it cut the price of its Model S ""Long Range"" sedan by 4% in the United States, days after the electric-car maker reported record quarterly deliveries.The company, which is expected to report third-quarter results on Oct. 21, cut the price to $71,990 from $74,990 in the United States. It also trimmed the starting price of the Model S by 3% in China. (https://bit.ly/34PqCew)Earlier this month, Tesla cut the starting price of its Chinese-made Model 3 sedans by about 8% to 249,900 yuan ($36,805).The world's largest carmaker has been trimming prices on various models in its lineup at the same time legacy automakers are trying to make inroads in the electric vehicle market by launching their own electric cars.Tesla said it delivered 139,300 vehicles in the third quarter, an all-time record, yet shares fell as some analysts doubted if Tesla could hit its ambitious year-end target. Last week, the company's Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk told employees that Tesla has a chance to produce a half-million cars this year, according to an internal email seen by Reuters. Tesla said in January that 2020 vehicle deliveries should comfortably exceed 500,000 units, a forecast it has left unchanged despite the COVID-19 pandemic.This means the company will have to increase deliveries to nearly 182,000 in the fourth quarter to reach that target.Shares of the electric carmaker, which have surged more than five times this year, were up nearly 1% at $445.10 in pre-market trade.(Reporting by Akanksha Rana in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)((akanksha.rana@thomsonreuters.com; ; Twitter: @AkankshaRanaa;))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tesla-cuts-prices-of-model-s-in-united-states-china-2020-10-13

270,"Oct 13, 2020 7:11AM EDT","Back in 1993, when drugmaker Amarin's (NASDAQ: AMRN) shares first hit the market, it might have cost you $1,425 to buy one share (adjusted for splits). Go forward a few decades, and that one share now costs a little over $5. Clean Energy Fuels (NASDAQ: CLNE) , meanwhile, hit its high-water mark in 2012, with the share price almost touching $25. Now the stock has lost 90% of its value, and currently trades for $2.50.Yet there is reason to be optimistic about both companies. Read on to see why you might want to buy these shares at rock-bottom prices.Image source: Getty Images.One-quarter of all adult Americans have high triglycerides. If you're one of them, it means you have too many fats (lipids) in your bloodstream. This is an unhealthy state of affairs that raises the risk of heart damage.Amarin's pill, Vascepa, reduces triglyceride levels. Several years ago, the company wanted to market this drug as helpful to reducing the risk of heart attack or stroke. But the FDA's response was the equivalent of ""Not so fast; there's no evidence that reducing triglycerides does all that. You're going to have to prove it.""So Amarin spent the next several years doing exactly that. In 2018, the company revealed the results of its Reduce-It trial. And it was a spectacular success. Everybody in the study was on statins, but patients who also took Vascepa to reduce triglycerides saw significant improvements in heart health. The drug reduced stroke by 28%, reduced heart attacks by 31%, and reduced death by 20%, compared to the group that was on statin-only therapy.This amazing news sent the stock on a rampage -- it quadrupled in one day. Amarin investors were overjoyed, seeing visions of a possible $20 billion valuation in the near future.But that's not how it worked out. First the world was hit by COVID-19. That health scare made it difficult for the company's sales force to visit hospitals and educate doctors about Vascepa. Nonetheless, Amarin's revenue was up 112% in the first quarter of this year. But in March came a disaster: A trial judge out in Nevada ruled that the company's Vascepa patent was invalid, on the grounds that it was ""obvious.""The stock dropped 70% in a day. The share price fell all the way to $3.36 in September. Since then the stock has started to bounce back, rising 50% in less than a month. Is this a ""dead-cat bounce"" (temporary recovery), or are there any reasons for optimism?I'm a firm believer in the latter. After all, Amarin still has half a billion dollars in net cash. And Vascepa is halfway to blockbuster status already, with $500 million in annualized sales. Ani Fadia, an analyst at SVB Leerink, estimates peak sales of $2.8 billion a year for Vascepa in Europe alone. Europe (and Asia) are both sizable markets, and Amarin still has patent protection there.Right now the market has priced Amarin for next-to-nothing growth, with a price-to-sales ratio of 3. Yet the opportunity for Vascepa in the rest of the world remains huge. Even in the U.S., it's still a sizable opportunity, with almost 10 million people who are on statin medication with high triglycerides.Understand that Vascepa is a cheap pill right now. Its current retail price (without any generic competition yet) is about $3 a pill, or $6 a day. Because the drug is already cheap, Amarin estimates that ""little, if any, money, is likely to be saved by patients or by insurance companies from the availability of a generic version of Vascepa.""At current prices, Amarin has a $21 billion total addressable market in the U.S. ($6 x 365 days x 10 million people). It's an odd situation in that Amarin's drug is going off-patent before having been established in medical practice. The future of U.S. sales is highly uncertain, both for Amarin and for any generic competition.Further approval of Vascepa in Europe (expected in early 2021) should send the stock higher in the near term. Investors have reason to be very bullish about the opportunity in the rest of the world. Sales in the U.S. will be in a state of flux for some time. But the cheap stock price gives us significant upside.  What's the most environmentally friendly company on the planet? My nominee would be Clean Energy Fuels. You know the ""Green New Deal"" being discussed in Congress, which is focused on renewable energy? The legislation even mentions ""farting cows"" as a source of pollution to be addressed. Clean Energy has inspired a market in which people take that methane gas, and other organic waste from agriculture and landfills, and recycle it into renewable natural gas.This type of natural gas is chemically the same as natural gas found in the earth. Producers are now turning this renewable resource into liquid natural gas (LNG), and this fuel -- which Clean Energy calls Redeem -- is replacing dirty diesel fuel in heavy-duty trucks.The company has over 550 natural gas stations in the United States and Canada, and it has already sold over 400 million gallons of natural gas to vehicles that have been equipped to run on that fuel, removing 745,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from the air.    UPS is a major client of Clean Energy. Other big clients include FedEx, Waste Management, and Amazon. Clean Energy is now profitable and is growing Redeem sales by 30% a year.So why did the stock tank? The market seems to believe that heavy-duty trucks will soon run on electricity, not LNG. In 2017, Elon Musk and Tesla announced that the electric-car company would offer an electric truck, named Semi, in 2019. But it's still not here, and even if and when it does arrive, there are still major problems with the idea that it will win major market share. Using current technology, the battery to run a Semi would weigh over 10,000 pounds. In and of itself, that would kill any demand for the truck. Aside from that, renewable natural gas is actually an environmentally superior solution compared with electric trucks. By removing harmful methane gas from farms, wastewater plants, and landfills, RNG is not just a carbon-neutral solution, it's carbon-negative.While it's always dangerous to bet against Mr. Musk, semi trucks are one area of the market that are unlikely to go electric any time soon. Tesla bulls might want to hedge their exuberance a bit and buy some shares of Clean Energy Fuels, which is likely to be the ultimate winner as the $20 billion semi-truck market goes green.10 stocks we like better than AmarinWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

271,"Oct 13, 2020 7:06AM EDT","Electric vehicle pioneer Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is attempting to revolutionize the automobile industry, and with visionary CEO Elon Musk at the helm, it looks to have a bright future in a fast-growing market. Knowing this, investors have bid up Tesla's shares to the tune of 787% in the past year. The S&P 500 has risen by a comparatively meager 18% in the same period. The downside to Tesla's stellar gains, though, is that its stock now looks overvalued. The company is trading at 1,130 times past and 232 times future earnings, and boasts a market cap of about $405 billion. At those levels, many years of success are already factored into Tesla's share price. As such, investors today might be better served to look elsewhere for growth stocks. One in particular that is worth your attention is Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG). Here's why the healthcare giant is a better growth buy than Tesla right now. TSLA data by YChartsIntuitive is best known for its da Vinci surgical system, the leading robotic-assisted surgery device. It enables surgeons to conduct minimally invasive surgeries, performed through small incisions using laparoscopic cameras and smaller instruments. Such surgeries offer several advantages over traditional operations, including less bleeding, less pain, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery times. Those benefits explain the da Vinci's popularity, and why it looks to have a long growth path ahead.  Further, medical device giant Medtronic estimates that only 2% of surgeries worldwide are performed using robotic-assisted devices. Because of these factors (and others), we can expect the market for such systems will grow rapidly in the coming years. Research firm Grand View Research thinks it will be worth $8.24 billion in revenue by 2025, up from $2.9 billion in 2020.It's worth noting that robotic-assisted surgical devices aren't cheap -- Intuitive Surgical's da Vincis cost between half a million dollars and $2.5 million.Image source: Getty Images.Not all healthcare facilities can afford that price tag, but the company does offer leasing arrangements, so hospitals can acquire the device without laying out the entire cost up front. Intuitive Surgical will be able to attract more customers thanks to this option. At the end of the second quarter, 5,764 da Vinci systems were installed worldwide, up 9% year over year. Expect the number of da Vincis in use to keep growing at a good clip. Even if its industry is on an upward trajectory, investors may question whether Intuitive Surgical will be able to remain the dominant player. One major reason to think it will is that the company has carved out a competitive advantage for itself, which will help it stay ahead of the competition. Launching robotic-assisted surgical devices on the market is no easy task. Just building these complex machines is daunting, and that's only the first step.Companies then have to earn clearance from regulators (the da Vinci system was cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration back in 2000). Following regulatory clearance, companies have to build accompanying instruments, market their products to healthcare facilities, and properly train medical staff to use the machines.Intuitive Surgical has already jumped through these hoops. Competitors hoping to knock the healthcare company off its pedestal will have to do the same before they can catch up. And while its peers fight this uphill battle to make a dent in the industry, Intuitive Surgical will continue to look for ways to strengthen its position in this market. For those reasons, investors can expect this company to remain one of the biggest players in its market for many years to come. Intuitive Surgical isn't a cheap stock either. The company's price-to-earnings ratio is 78, while its forward P/E is 82. But both of those metrics compare favorably to Tesla's. Further, Intuitive Surgical's $86.4 billion market cap is also less than 20% that of the electric-car maker. While both of these companies are leaders in high-growth industries -- and both are worth adding to your portfolio -- at current levels, Intuitive Surgical looks like a much better buy. 10 stocks we like better than Intuitive SurgicalWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

274,"Oct 13, 2020 5:16AM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAfter literally years of anticipation, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock investors are finally getting the iPhone 12. While Apple’s first 5G-capable iPhone will most certainly feature some impressive technology, there’s a much bigger question for investors. How will the AAPL stock price react to today’s big reveal?Inexperienced investors may believe that an impressive Apple iPhone 12 event means the shares are headed higher in the near-term. In reality, the key catalyst for AAPL stock this week will be just how high expectations have grown ahead of the event.Yes, the iPhone 12 is very important for Apple investors. Back in January, I wrote about how a 5G iPhone was a big reason for AAPL stock investors to be excited. However, even back then I talked about how much the stock had already risen in anticipation.As a value investor at heart, I absolutely believe a company’s fundamentals are important. The better the iPhone 12, the more sales there will be. The more sales, the more profits Apple will make. Therefore, the better the iPhone 12 is, the better it is for AAPL stock in the long-term.However, most analysts and Apple investors already believe the iPhone 12 will be awesome. They already expect millions and millions of iPhone sales.“Importantly, with our estimation that 350 million of 950 million iPhones worldwide are currently in the window of an upgrade opportunity, we believe this will translate into an unprecedented upgrade cycle for Cook & Co.,” respected Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said.When you are expecting 350 million to 950 million iPhone upgrades, it’s nearly impossible to surprise to the upside. When your company has a $2.1 trillion market cap, how much success is already priced in?If you are a long-term AAPL stock investor, I believe you should mostly ignore today’s iPhone 12 event. True, the Apple stock price today is coming off of Monday’s 6.3% gain. But, to be honest, Apple puts out a new iPhone every year. This will not change the investment thesis on Apple. As long as Apple continues to have the best phone on the market and keeps its customers happy, the devices will be a cash cow for the company.In the near-term, the iPhone 12 itself won’t have a major impact on Apple’s fundamentals. Investors won’t know how well it is actually selling for months. The more important factor will be the market psychology surrounding the event.Typically, the more an event is hyped, the more likely it is to disappoint the market. Take the recent Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Battery Day event as an example. TSLA stock was up 7.4% in the two weeks leading up to Battery Day. In the two days after, it was down 15.3%.Big events can definitely be major catalysts for stocks. But the biggest bullish moves typically occur ahead of the event. The iPhone 12 has been hyped up for more than a year, and AAPL stock has doubled. Another way to think about that move is that the market has already assigned roughly $1 trillion in value to the iPhone 12.I’m guessing the iPhone 12 event will be a sell-the-news event in which Apple shares will initially react negatively on Tuesday and/or Wednesday. If, however, they initially pop, I bet traders will likely take that opportunity to cash out their gains and the stock will correct in the weeks to come.I absolutely love AAPL stock as a long-term investment. But I believe now is not the right time to be buying Apple given near-term risk is skewed to the downside ahead of the iPhone 12 event.As I said back in January, Apple is drowning in cash, which is pretty much the best thing to be drowning in. They have a massive and loyal user base and a long-term growth trajectory that would make almost any other company jealous.I believe AAPL stock is one of the best blue chip stocks of the 21st century. If you’re looking to establish or add to your position, wait until after the iPhone 12 event. Be ready to pounce on any sell-the-news dip in the next couple of weeks and buy the stock.On the date of publication, Wayne Duggan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.Wayne Duggan has been a U.S. News & World Report Investing contributor since 2016 and is a staff writer at Benzinga, where he has written more than 7,000 articles.

275,"Oct 13, 2020 3:02AM EDT","Tesla’s stock has rallied by about 5x this year, with its current market cap standing at about $400 billion. Can the stock continue to outperform, joining the rarefied group of companies with a $1 trillion market capitalization? It’s possible. Although Tesla stock looks pricey at current levels, if the company executes well and the markets continue to view its prospects favorably, a $1 trillion valuation remains within reach by 2025.Our interactive analysis on Tesla Upside: How Tesla Gets To A $1 Trillion Market Cap provides a detailed breakdown of how Tesla’s value could grow 2.5x by 2025. You can modify key assumptions to arrive at your own valuation for Tesla for the 2025 and 2030 period.Tesla’s Revenue GrowthTesla’s Revenues can grow by 3.7x to levels of about $112 billion in 2025, from an estimated $30 billion in 2020, representing a growth rate of roughly 30% per year. While deliveries are likely to grow to close to 500k units this year, they could possibly stand at about 2.1 million cars by 2025 – a growth rate of about 35% (versus about 56% growth for the 2015 to 2020E period). This is possible considering three trends 1) Tesla is quickly scaling up manufacturing capacity with new factories (Shanghai, upcoming Berlin and Texas) and new models (Model Y, upcoming Cybertruck, and planned lower-end models) 2) Large size of the auto market, favorable regulations, and a lack of a real direct competitor (thus far) in the electric vehicles (EV) and autonomous driving space 3) The Covid-19 led disruption in the auto market could also slow down mainstream automakers’ shift to EVs, giving Tesla an edge. That said, Tesla’s average selling prices could continue to trend lower, to about $48k per vehicle as Tesla produces more mass-market vehicles. This would translate to Automotive Revenue of roughly $102 billion. We also expect Tesla’s Other Revenues (which include Service and Energy) to rise to about $10 billion by 2025, for a total of about $112 billion in Revenue by 2025. Tesla’s Margins & ProfitsCombine revenue growth with the fact that Tesla’s Net Margins (net income, or profits after all expenses and taxes, calculated as a percent of revenues) are on an improving trajectory. They grew from -22% in 2015 to about -1% in 2019 and it’s likely that they will improve to about 6% in 2020, with Net Profits standing at $1.8 billion.  Tesla’s margins could possibly expand to about 17.5% by 2025 (for about $20 billion in Net Profits). How is this possible? As Tesla scales up deliveries and further automates its manufacturing process, fixed cost absorption should improve. Tesla also expects battery costs to decline by over 50% in about 3 years, and this should also help margins considerably. (Tesla Can Post Apple-Like Margins. Here’s How) Thirdly, improving self-driving capabilities should drive software sales further, helping margins. (How Do Tesla’s Software Sales Impact Its Gross Margins?) So is 11x growth in earnings possible in the next five years? Yes. This appears possible when you combine 3.7x revenue growth with the 3x growth that’s possible in Tesla’s margins.Tesla’s ValuationNow if earnings grow 11x, will Tesla’s P/E multiple shrink to 1/11th its current level, keeping its stock price at current levels? Probably not.  If earnings really expand 11x over the next few years, instead of the P/E shrinking from around 220x now to about 20x, a scenario where the P/E metric falls more modestly to about 50x is likely if the markets expect Tesla to continue to post above-average growth rates, with reduced risk. For context, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a P/E of 35x, despite averaging Revenue growth of about 5% over the last 5 years, although its margins stand at over 20%. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) , on the other hand, trades at a P/E based on 2020 earnings of roughly 100x, with Revenue growth averaging 25% and Net Margins of about 4%. With a 50x multiple on a Net Income of about $20 billion in 2025, Tesla could be valued at $1 trillion.What if you’re looking for a more balanced portfolio instead? Here’s a high-quality portfolio to beat the market, with over 100% return since 2016, versus 50% for the S&P 500.

Hope for help from Washington beat down any worries about the coronavirus pandemic, and high-flying tech stocks led the Nasdaq Composite to another huge gain. Rises for the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) and S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) were a bit more muted but still added to their recent rallies.IndexPercentage ChangePoint ChangeDow0.88%251S&P 5001.64%57Nasdaq Composite2.56%296Data source: Yahoo! Finance.When the stock market crashes, it's easy to understand why so many investors get uncomfortable. Yet in many ways, when the market climbs precipitously -- as we've seen over the past several days -- it can be even harder for investors to handle. That might not seem to make sense, and it wouldn't if everyone followed one simple principle. But market melt-ups reveal the shortcomings of one of the biggest mistakes that many investors make.We've seen huge ups and huge downs throughout 2020, and even though there hasn't been a market crash the size of what we saw in February and March, it's still been staggering to see the pace at which market sentiment can turn. Throughout much of the summer, markets gained ground, with many indexes punching through old highs at the beginning of September.^DJI data by YCharts.That was followed by an abrupt downturn that took most of September. Yet after that correction, markets have moved higher quickly and furiously, with major benchmarks seeing gains of as much as 12% from their lows just a couple of weeks ago. Volatile stocks such as Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) have seen even more dramatic moves in their share prices.The emotional response to a market crash is obvious: fear. It's easy to understand why investors can lose their perspective when they're afraid.Image source: Getty Images.The last thing that you'd think investors would have to deal with during a market melt-up is fear. But fear does play a role here:What's more, investors who make mistakes during big bull moves feel especially exposed. In a market crash, everyone's losing money, so it doesn't feel as bad. But the thought that everyone's making money except for you -- well, that's a tough one for most people to swallow.Just as market crashes teach investors not to take on more risk than they're comfortable with, market melt-ups teach investors not to take on less risk than they're capable of handling. Moreover, just as crashes show the defensive benefits of diversification, melt-ups can reveal that your portfolio doesn't have enough exposure to the parts of the stock market that are performing the best.Handling emotions in investing is always a difficult experience. You won't always get it right. But it's always worth the effort, because there's so much at stake that you can't afford simply to ignore the danger and hope you never fall into the traps that bull market melt-ups pose.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

278,"Oct 12, 2020 6:37PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhen it comes to the burgeoning luxury EV market, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) gets all the love on Wall Street — and reasonably so. Elon Musk and company pioneered the space, dominate the space and continue to make the market’s best and most desirable vehicles. But in this market traditionally dominated by Tesla, it’s time to start throwing some love at an emerging luxury EV automaker by the name of Fisker, which is going public through a reverse merger with Spartan Energy Acquisition Corp (NASDAQ:SPAQ) stock. The reason to like Fisker — and SPAQ stock — is simple.The EV maker has enough enough talent and experience — it’s headed by Henrik Fisker, who is a legend when it comes to luxury automobile design — to realistically emerge as a viable competitive threat to Tesla in the burgeoning and soon-to-be-enormous luxury EV space.Is Fisker a Tesla killer? No. Far from it.But Tesla won’t run away with the entire luxury EV market by itself. Tesla will be the leader. Fisker will be a solid second-fiddle.Fisker’s implied market cap today based on the SPAQ stock price? Around $4 billion. Tesla’s market cap? Close to $400 billion.Needless to say, SPAQ stock has huge long-term upside potential amid the EV boom of the 2020s.Here’s a deeper look.There will be no greater disruption in the 2020s than the electrification of automobile transportation.About 64.3 million new passenger cars were sold globally in 2019. Only 2.3 million of them (or 3.5%) were electric, which is up 97,500 (0.15% penetration_ in 2013.Clearly, the shift towards EV has already started. It will only accelerate in the 2020s.Demand is shifting, as over 80% of prospective car buyers today want an EV. Laws are shifting, as California just banned the sale of gas cars post-2035. Technology is improving, with the average range of an EV has increasing by 140% since 2011. Costs are falling, with average EV prices having dropped 70% since 2010. Supply is pivoting, as every auto maker in the world is making an all-out blitz into the EV category.The future couldn’t be any clearer.EVs are on the cusp of disrupting the multi-trillion-dollar auto market, and over the next two decades, will become globally ubiquitous.Where there’s disruption, there’s opportunity.Sure, all the major auto OEMs are going to launch new EVs and try to keep up with the times. But they’ve been glacially slow in doing so – and in all the time they’ve wasted deciding if EVs are the future, new auto brands committed to a 100% EV future have emerged and are ready to rapidly steal share from these auto market incumbents.See Tesla, NIO (NYSE:NIO), Workhorse (NASDAQ:WKHS), Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV), so on and so forth.Right now, you should add Fisker and SPAQ stock to that list.Fisker is not just another up-and-coming EV maker with a bold vision and a small chance of success.The company is headed up by Henrik Fisker, a man whose reputation in unrivaled in the luxury auto market. He was, after all, the design brain behind many of the luxury automobile world’s most iconic vehicles, such as the Aston Martin DB9, the Aston Martin Vantage, the BMW Z8 and the BMW X5.Given his experience and track record, when Henrik designs a car, the world pays attention.Over the past several years, Henrik has spent all his time and effort designing the Fisker Ocean, which — when it launches in fourth quarter of 2022 — will be a legitimate rival to Tesla’s Model X and Y in terms of performance, design and features.The Fisker Ocean offers best-in-market driving range at up to 300 miles (which is largely consistent with base versions of the Model X and Y).It also offers four-wheel drive for off-roading, lots of horsepower, a sub 3 second 0-to-60 miles-per-hour get-up, a large digital display screen equipped with a state-of-the-art in-vehicle software platform, and a very aesthetic, futuristic exterior design (all of these features are comparable to the Tesla Model X and Y).Sure, it’s smaller in terms of cargo space (45 cubic feet with seats down, versus 60+ cubic feet for the X and Y) and seating space (it’s a 5-seater, versus options for 7-seater in the X and Y). But the Ocean makes up for those shortcomings via a built-in solar panel roof (which will allow for auto-recharging while driving, and therefore, result in longer driving ranges) and a fully “vegan” interior (the entire interior is made from recyclable materials).So, on a technical specs and aesthetics basis, the Ocean is pretty close to rivaling Tesla’s Model X and Model Y.Yet the Ocean will retail for just $37,500 – well below the $50,000 base price for the Model Y, and $80,000 base price for the Model X. After tax credits, that retail price falls to about $30,000 – putting it on par with most mid-size, gas-powered luxury SUVs out there (and below many of them).Needless to say, then, if Fisker brings the Ocean to market at this $37,5000 price point, it’ll be a complete game-change for the luxury EV market — and huge upside catalyst for SPAQ stock.Of course, that’s a huge “if”. There’s a lot of execution risk when it comes to scaling manufacturing for a new car, especially for a company that has yet to manufacture any cars at scale like Fisker.Plus, as many know, this is not Henrik Fisker’s first foray into the EV space. His first car – the electric sports car Karma, which counted Justin Bieber and Al Gore as customers – ended up being a flop after the company’s battery supplier went under.But that’s why Fisker is aiming to outsource all of the manufacturing this time around, through Volkswagen – the world’s largest automobile maker. In so doing, Fisker is significantly reducing execution risk, battery supplier reliance, capital requirements, manufacturing costs and speed-to-market.Plus, the partnership will allow Fisker to hyper-focus on design and software – two components which will help the company establish and sustain competitive advantages.Overall, then, while there is still tons of execution risk here, there is also much less risk for Fisker than for most other emerging EV makers — and that makes SPAQ stock especially attractive amid the sea of red-hot EV stocks.The math to SPAQ stock scoring you huge gains isn’t hard to follow.Management is targeting 225,000 deliveries, $13.2 billion in revenue, and $2.8 billion adjusted EBITDA by 2025. My modeling suggests those targets are very doable, given that the EV market will likely measure 10+ million global unit sales by then.Tesla stock, over the past year, has average a forward EV/EBITDA multiple of ~20X. Based on a 20X forward multiple, $2.8 billion in 2025 adjusted EBITDA implies a 2024 enterprise value for Fisker of $56 billion.The current enterprise value – after backing out ~$1 billion in cash – is $3 billion.Thus, SPAQ stock does have a semi-visible runway to rise almost 20X over the next five years.I can guarantee you that not many stocks are going to rise 20X over the next four years alone.But Fisker could, amid a surge in luxury EV demand.For that reason alone, SPAQ stock should absolutely be on your buy radar today.On the date of publication, Luke Lango did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The New Daily 10X Stock Report: 98.7% Accuracy – Gains Up to 466.78%.

279,"Oct 12, 2020 5:25PM EDT","Shares of Chinese technology company WiMi Hologram Cloud (NASDAQ: WIMI) soared on Monday after an article by MobiusTrend Group highlighted the potential of technology interfaces between computers and the human brain. The stock finished up 34% for the day, although it had been as much as 55% higher earlier in the session.WiMi stock is roaring back to life after being left for dead. Earlier in the year, it was a multi-bagger trade because of the buzz surrounding hologram technology. But excitement eventually waned, and shares gave back most of the earlier gains -- until today.WIMI data by YChartsThe article by MobiusTrend Group was focused on the development of brain-to-computer interface technologies. For an example, it mentioned CTRL-Labs, a company acquired by Facebook in 2019 whose wristband hardware can reportedly send brain signals to a computer. The article also mentioned a company called Neuralink, a start-up founded by Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Neuralink recently made headlines by offering a demonstration of a device inserted into the brains of pigs, displaying their brain signals on a screen in real time. Facebook has a nearly $800 billion market capitalization, while Tesla has over a $400 billion market cap. It makes sense these tech empires and their founders would be chasing futuristic opportunities like this. But by mentioning a small-cap company like WiMi Hologram Cloud in the same article, it was enough to send the stock skyrocketing.Image source: Getty Images.Here's the thing: It's hard to understand how WiMi even connects to this. The article didn't say anything about how holograms could be used in brain-interface technologies, and there's not even a remote business arrangement between Tesla, Facebook, and WiMi Hologram Cloud. In short, nothing changed with WiMi today in the least; its prospects didn't suddenly improve.As I've warned before, it's imperative for investors to understand exactly how WiMi generates revenue. According to its 2019 annual report, it generates revenue by creating advertising campaigns and running middleware payment software in mobile apps. Its revenue does not come from selling hologram hardware or anything similar. When WiMi first caught investors' eyes earlier this year, there was reason to question if the press release was from an objective source. It's fair to question that again. Investors should look for verifiable third-party validation of WiMi's opportunity in brain-interface technology. Investors should also wait to get a quarterly update from management. The only problem is management hasn't filed anything with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) since the American depository shares (ADS) began trading in the U.S. back in June.There's enough red flags here for investors to not chase WiMi Hologram Cloud stock today. Look toward the many less risky opportunities out there.10 stocks we like better than WiMi Hologram Cloud Inc.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

280,"Oct 12, 2020 3:28PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs EV mania cools, is now the time to dive into Kensington Capital (NYSE:KCAC)? Reaching prices as high as $25.75 per share last month, Kensington Capital stock has sold off, and now changes hands around $14 per share. But this SPAC (blank-check company), which is acquiring privately-held QuantumScape, remains a solid play on the future of EVs.How so? QuantumScape isn’t an EV automaker. Instead, the company is going after what could be a lucrative segment of the EV economy: batteries. But, instead of offering lithium-ion batteries (the industry norm), this company is looking to gain an edge with its line of SSBs, or solid-state batteries.As I previously discussed, SSBs could be what makes EVs economically viable. That is to say, accelerate the shift from gasoline-powered vehicles to EVs.Sure, QuantumScape faces a long road ahead. Its flagship product won’t be available until 2025. Yet, with major auto names like Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) backing the company, it’s clear this development-stage company has big potential.So, what’s the play here? There’s a case to be made that shares will bounce back once its acquisition wraps up. But, tread carefully, given the risk today’s EV Bubble gets ready to burst.There’s no denying the long-term runway with QuantumScape. But, given that said success is years off, why buy now? I agree, there’s room for concern. Between risks the EV bubble pops (more below), as well as the underlying uncertainty as this company turns its technology into a marketable product, there’s a lot of risk buying in at today’s prices.Yet, while it’ll be years before Kensington Capital stock really “pays off,” there’s potential for a near-term pop to prior price levels. How so? As InvestorPlace’s Mark Hake calculated last month, the projected value of Quantumscape in 2028 could mean shares today have a present value around $22 per share.Sure, valuing a growth stock this way is more an art than a science. But, this could signal that risk/return remains in your favor at today’s prices. If others catch onto this, shares may bounce back toward the highs set in September.On the other hand, there’s also good reason why shares could continue heading lower. The EV bubble has yet to pop. But, it’s hard to deny the enthusiasm for the EV is starting to fade.And, if said mania continues to cool, it may be hard for Kensington Capital stock to stay at today’s prices, much less rally higher.A major risk for Kensington (soon to be QuantumScape) shares is a crash in EV stocks. The bubble that helped pushed to sector to all-time highs has yet to burst. But, shares in major EV names, like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Nio (NYSE:NIO), and Workhorse (NASDAQ:WKHS) have topped out, or headed lower, in recent weeks.While enthusiasm remains fairly high, further downside could be on the horizon. We know that’s a big risk for these aforementioned names, which have each multiplied in value so far this year. But, how will newly-minted EV stocks like Kensington fare if the bubble bursts?An investor exodus from EV stocks could mean big downside from today’s prices. A sector sell-off could even push shares well below their IPO price ($10 per share). Keep this in mind if you are interested in taking advantage of the recent pullback.But, a burst of the EV bubble isn’t the only factor that could send shares lower in the short term. The specter of a new publicly-traded EV battery company could dilute interest in this particular name. As Barron’s reported Oct 6,  SPAC RMG Acquisition (NYSE:RMG) is acquiring privately held EV battery maker Romeo.Yes, comparing QuantumScape to Romeo isn’t really apples-to-apples. But, with more ways to invest in this emerging industry, investors may spread their bets widely. Some who hold Kensington shares now may sell them, and plow some of it into a Romeo position.In short, there are plenty of reasons why shares could see selling pressure in the near term. But, if shares do fall to single digits, consider such price levels screaming buy territory.With the big potential of its acquisition target (QuantumScape), Kensington shares remain a strong opportunity. But not without a high level of risk. The company could experience hiccups as it brings its SSBs to market. The EV bubble could finally pop, possibly pushing shares down to single digits. And now, with another EV battery name going public, interest in this play could fade, even if EV stock enthusiasm overall continues.So, what’s the play here? Long-term opportunity with Kensington Capital stock remains. But tread carefully, as shares could head lower in the near-term.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not (either directly or indirectly) hold any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Thomas Niel, contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single stock analysis since 2016.The post Despite the Pullback, Tread Carefully With Kensington Capital appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/despite-the-pullback-tread-carefully-with-kensington-capital-2020-10-12

281,"Oct 12, 2020 12:47PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApps seem to be doing to the financial system and momentum investing what the cloud has done to technology. They’re breaking it up. They’re creating a new world and leaving the old one behind. But that world is no more honest than the one it replaces.Nowhere is this more evident than with Robinhood Markets, founded in 2013, which runs the Robinhood stock trading app.But while Robinhood makes it easy for you to buy, say, one-tenth of a share in IBM (NYSE:IBM), it has resisted going public itself. Instead it has raised $2.2 billion privately, most recently through a $660 million round in September. The company now has a valuation of $11 billion with just 56 investors.Markets assumed a few years ago that established players, like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) or Charles Schwab (NASDAQ:SCHW), could buy out the fintech industry and maintain control of the system.That’s proving impossible. New banking and brokerage companies, built connecting simple apps to existing banking systems, are remaining under venture capital control until they reach valuations big players can’t afford.For instance Schwab, which just finished buying TD Ameritrade for $22 billion, currently carries a market cap of $70.5 billion. Buying Robinhood even now would represent significant dilution. Instead Schwab is trying to copy some of what Robinhood does by selling fractional shares, which it calls stock slices.It’s not working. Robinhood now executes 4.3 million trades a day, almost as many as TD Ameritrade and Schwab combined. They do it by selling their order flow to professional traders, who profit from being on the other side of the trade.What can be wrong with that?It’s dangerous because Robinhood doesn’t just sell stocks. Robinhood began trading cryptocurrencies in 2018. It also trades options, where investors can quickly lose more than their initial stake. If you sold Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) short as its price skyrocketed early this year, you understand the risk. Now imagine if you sold short with no clue about the risk.Robinhood’s marketing encourages young, inexperienced investors to trade heavily, with fractional shares, no fees, and products built with high risk. Critics say it steals from the poor and gives to the rich. The get-rich-quick mentality of Robinhood traders is easy to take advantage of. The most popular stocks there among those traders as this was written were Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE), a $5 billion space plane company that has no flights, and Catalyst Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:CPRX), a $340 million drug company that has no drugs.I wrote about this kind of trading mentality in Salon 20 years ago. This was a few months before a trader killed nine people in an office blocks from the one I had visited, then killed himself.You can’t beat the house, and you can’t beat the machines. The best way for the small investor to make money is to buy good companies and let time do its work.Every market has its stories of excess, of small players getting taken and of greed taking over.Momentum investing with Robinhood is just the latest iteration.The question for you is whether the company behind the trend has legs. The day trading companies I covered, which rented computers and fast data lines in 1999, were gone by 2002. When investors get smart about how to make money, the value of Robinhood’s order flow will fall, and Robinhood will have to adapt.When Robinhood does decide to IPO, a lot of smart people are going to tell you to buy. I won’t be one of them. The smart people will, at that very moment, be selling.Dana Blankenhorn has been a financial and technology journalist since 1978.

283,"Oct 12, 2020 9:46AM EDT","Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and ETFs heavy on the stock, including the ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEArca: ARKK), can continue bullishness established this year regardless of what happens on Election Day.“Companies within ARKK include those that rely on or benefit from the development of new products or services, technological improvements and advancements in scientific research relating to the areas of DNA technologies (‘’Genomic Revolution’), industrial innovation in energy, automation, and manufacturing (‘Industrial Innovation’), the increased use of shared technology, infrastructure and services (‘’Next Generation Internet’), and technologies that make financial services more efficient (‘Fintech Innovation’),” according to ARK Invest.It's widely expected that a victory by former Vice President Joe Biden will be a boon for clean energy stocks, potentially lifting Tesla and ARKK in the process.“Now, with the election coming, the Biden campaign is touting green technologies. Some policies would benefit Tesla as well as other green-energy stocks. A second Trump term, however, doesn’t have to derail the rally that has lifted the stock more than 400% this year,” reports Al Root for Barron's. “Still, the Biden plan calls for investment in charging infrastructure for electric vehicles. That would be a positive for all EV-linked stocks.”
Electric vehicles are viewed as cornerstones in the alternative energy movement, meaning there are political implications for the group.“Tesla and General Motors both used to gain from a program that allows people who buy electric cars to deduct $7,500 from their income for federal tax purposes, but the credit is no longer available once a company produces 200,000 vehicles or more. Both companies have crossed that line,” according to Barron's.However, President Trump being reelected doesn't dent the ARKK thesis. After all, the actively managed ETF more than doubled this year and is higher by 150% over the past year.Currently, electric vehicles represent a small percentage of new automobiles sold around the world and cars on the road, but that percentage is expected to increase in a big way over the next several years, but massive growth is coming for the industry. Increasing battery life and power is essential to converting more drivers to electric vehicles.

284,"Oct 12, 2020 6:34AM EDT","As a group, Robinhood investors tend to follow the latest hot trends in the markets. So while it's a safe bet that you'll find stocks like Apple and Tesla widely held in the portfolios of these retail and millennial investors, some companies that were popular with them prior to the February-March market crash have fallen far out of favor. Consider three companies that were in the Robinhood Top 100 on March 8 that no longer are today:  OrganiGram (NASDAQ: OGI), Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), and Costco (NASDAQ: COST). Let's take a look at what might have led those traders to sell them, and whether they're worth buying now.OrganiGram never recovered from this year's market crash -- year to date, its shares are down 50%. That's a far worse performance than the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences ETF (OTC: HMLSF) has delivered; that fund is off by 28%.Wall Street's sudden springtime plunge certainly inspired some investors to take a closer look at their holdings, and Robinhood users may have noticed just how unappealing an investment OrganiGram is.Image source: Getty Images.The Canadian cannabis company delivered its fiscal second-quarter report on April 14. Those results were for the period that ran through the end of February, when COVID-19 wasn't yet having an adverse impact on the company's business -- and even then, gross sales were down 18% year over year to 27.3 million Canadian dollars, while cost of sales rose by 45%. That drop in revenue came even as the company introduced new products including vape pens and cannabis-infused chocolates. Data from Health Canada shows that while companies are producing significantly more marijuana edibles -- their inventory levels are up 85% from March -- sales of edibles have only risen by 29% over the same period. With disappointing growth numbers and what's looking to be an underwhelming edibles market, it's no mystery why so many Robinhood investors ditched this stock.Salesforce is a more intriguing case. The company has continued to perform well amid the coronavirus pandemic. Its stock has recovered from the market crash, when it fell below $125 -- today, it's trading at more than double that price, up 60% year to date.The technology company, which helps businesses manage their customer relationships from the cloud, soared in value after it released its fiscal second-quarter results Aug. 25. Sales for the period ending July 31 were up 29% to nearly $5.2 billion. That performance beat analysts' expectations, leading management to boost its guidance for the fiscal year. More and more businesses are shifting their operations to the cloud, and Salesforce and its peers have benefited from the trend. That makes it a little surprising that this San Francisco-based company is no longer as popular with Robinhood investors as it was earlier this year. One possible explanation could be its sky-high valuation: Trading at more than 70 times forecast future earnings and 11 times sales, Salesforce is expensive, even by tech industry standards. Amazon, for instance, trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 60 and less than 5 times its revenue.The market crash may have spooked Robinhood investors, leading them to reconsider some of their higher-valuation investments -- Salesforce among them. Costco is another company that has experienced sharply higher sales due to the pandemic; people are loading up on the essentials in case they have to stay at home for long periods, and buying in bulk to reduce the number of trips they have to make to stores. These trends play directly to Costco's strengths.On Sept. 24, the mega-big-box retailer released its fiscal fourth-quarter results, which cover the period ending Aug. 30. Its revenue remained strong, rising 12% to $53.4 billion for the quarter. Full-year revenue of $166.8 billion was up by a more modest 9%.  But that was a bigger increase than in fiscal 2019, when its sales grew by just under 8% to $152.7 billion.As experts worry about further waves of coronavirus and the possible need for future shutdowns to combat them, Costco's sales continue to surge. On Oct. 7, it released its September numbers, reporting that net sales for the month rose by 17% year over year to $16.8 billion. Year to date, Costco's shares are up 24%, and before Salesforce's recent quarterly results and surge in price, its returns were comparable to the tech stock's performance.While Costco is generating good growth numbers now, they just may not be enough to captivate Robinhood investors and their love for high-growth stocks. And although its shares trade at fairly modest multiples, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 37 and a price-to-sales ratio of about 1, investors are less willing to pay big premiums to invest in companies that aren't growing at a high rate. Finally, given the way many retail businesses have been struggling this year, it's possible that Robinhood investors may not be eager to hold many retail stocks in their portfolios.Two of the three stocks on this list (sorry, OrganiGram) are soundly outperforming the S&P 500 this year:OGI data by YChartsThat said, the only one of these three that investors may want to consider adding to their portfolios today is Costco. Its shares aren't trading at a wild premium, and it's still generating solid growth. While the retailer's sales may slow down if the pandemic starts to subside, it's worth noting that the company was growing at a decent rate even before COVID-19 hit. It's a bit expensive, but of the stocks on this list, it offers investors the best mix of growth and value.10 stocks we like better than OrganiGram HoldingsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

285,"Oct 12, 2020 5:16AM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf we didn’t have the novel coronavirus, 2020 would most likely be known as the year of the special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC for short. Essentially, this is a backdoor method of going public, with several electric vehicle firms electing this option. Lordstown Motors, via a reverse merger with DiamondPeak Holdings (NASDAQ:DPHC), is one such name. And early on, DiamondPeak stock was the toast of town.Yes, fresh EV firms have had their trials and tribulations. But against the competition, DiamondPeak stock seemed to have substantial credibility. As I pointed out in early September, “… Lordstown plans to build its trucks late next year in a former General Motors (NYSE:GM) factory. Further, it has investments from GM, while Workhorse Group (NASDAQ:WKHS) owns a 10% stake.”Shortly after my article was published, DiamondPeak stock went on a blistering, albeit short, run. Since Sept. 21, DPHC has been on a volatile slide downward, erasing most of the earlier gains. So, what the heck just happened?Perusing other analysts’ work, I’ve come to the conclusion that Wall Street is freaked out about the mad rush toward EVs. Of course, I’m referencing Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA), one of my personal speculative bets. Heavy accusations that not all is what it seems has ground down NKLA from its prior lofty highs. Therefore, some suggest that DiamondPeak stock may have gotten overheated.It’s possible, although I’m not sure if that narrative makes sense. Again, DPHC stock garnered more credibility off the bat thanks to its production facility. Lordstown Motors has a very tangible path forward while other EVs have always been speculative affairs at best.In my view, DPHC is going negative because reality is sinking in.As proponents of EVs are quick to argue, the electric platform has fewer moving parts. Therefore, all else being equal, EVs are cheaper to maintain. Theoretically, this would be music to the ears of commercial construction fleet owners, which comprise Lordstown’s target buying audience.But one aspect that could negate the cost-savings argument for DiamondPeak stock is insurance. According to Bankrate.com, some of the insurance costs for EVs are reasonable. However, many are also on the more expensive end of the spectrum. For example, the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model S costs $775 for a six-month premium.Yes, the Model S is a pricey luxury EV. But the electric version of the Fiat 500 costs $750 to insure based on the same study. This indicates that insurance firms are taking a dim view of the electric technology. But why?According to Forbes, EVs are more expensive to insure in part because they’re more susceptible to damage. Typically, battery packs are the single-most costly component that goes into an EV. Further, they encompass much of the bottom surface area of a vehicle. Thus, a fender bender which a combustion-engine car might drive away from with only cosmetic damage could result in massive bills for an EV owner.More critically, Lordstown Motors is incorporating a unique technology for its flagship Endurance pickup truck. Utilizing four in-wheel hub motors, this methodology provides superior traction and reduces moving parts, among other benefits. But the key drawback, as I mentioned in my last write-up, is unsprung weight. Basically, “unsprung components absorb the forces of the road independently to the rest of the vehicle. Thus, this creates potential reliability issues.” To be fair, Lordstown has stress-tested this system and obviously, it has confidence in it. However, wheels are susceptible to damage beyond road impacts. If something strikes the wheels from the side, the Endurance owner could be looking at hefty repair bills.It’s also fair to point out that hub motors have been around for more than a century, according to MachineDesign.com. Thus, manufacturers have had difficulty bringing this methodology to the public, which says something. As well, insurance firms may not be in a hurry to cover a radical automotive design without some sharp premiums.Ultimately, I don’t think it’s time to hit the panic button. Anyone can see that society is shifting toward electrification. First, it’s passenger cars and currently, we’re talking about e-pickup trucks. Later, industrial and agricultural machines will start shifting toward alternative energy sources.Therefore, if you have a longer-term view on DiamondPeak stock, I wouldn’t worry just yet. But the markets appear to be assessing the realities of EV integration. And issues such as insurance will apply pressure. For those who are looking to get in, I’d wait a bit to let this volatility bleed out.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in NKLA.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Tesla posted record quarterly deliveries in the third quarter. Analysts expect LG Chem's battery business to remain profitable in the third quarter and its mainstay petrochemicals business to post solid profits.Despite the rosy outlook, LG Chem shares fell 2.3% over concerns of fire risks associated with its battery cells for Hyundai Motor's 005380.KS Kona electric vehicles. LG Chem said faulty battery cells were not the cause of fires in Kona EVs, and the exact cause had not been determined.Tesla's long-term plan to produce its own cells have hurt LG Chem shares, which had rallied this year due to EV expectations. LG Chem shares also have been under pressure after it said last month that it plans to separate its battery business as an independent unit.

287,"Oct 10, 2020 8:07AM EDT","So, America -- how are you enjoying your payroll tax cut?In a memorandum dated August 8, 2020, President Donald Trump directed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to ""defer certain payroll tax obligations with respect to the American workers most in need."" Specifically, collection of payroll taxes on any employee earning ""generally ... less than $4,000"" every two weeks are to be suspended during the period from September 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020.Thus, if your salary is under $104,000 per year, you should not currently be seeing contributions for Social Security and for Medicare -- totaling 7.65% of your wages -- deducted from your paycheck. (I say ""should"" because, according to news reports, not all private employers are complying with the directive -- and in fact they are not required to do so.) One big tax cut is already here, and more may be on the way. Image source: Getty Images.Now, there are a few problems with this directive. For one thing, it doesn't help everyone. If you make too much money (say, $104,001 a year) or if you don't ""generally"" collect an actual paycheck -- if you're a freelancer or contractor, unemployed, or retired -- the president's memo doesn't affect you at all.What's more, even if you do benefit from the deferrals, your respite may only be temporary. You see, despite the name, President Trump's payroll tax cut isn't actually a ""cut"" at all. Rather, the executive order only defers collection of these payroll taxes. The taxes are still owed to the government, though, and may be collected after the Dec. 31 deadline expires -- increasing your payroll taxes in 2021 as a result.It would take a literal act of Congress to eliminate this tax debt, and so far, that hasn't happened.Still, in the meantime, passing this payroll tax deferral is seen as a way to temporarily lighten the load on lower-income households and put more cash in more hands, faster, to stimulate the economy.How much cash are we talking about? Well, say you earn $18 an hour -- approximately $36,000 a year, the ""Real Median Personal Income"" in the United States, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. If you work 40 hours a week, your biweekly paycheck would be $1,440 before taxes. So your ""extra"" income for those two weeks would be 0.0765 times $1,440, or $110.16. 55 bucks a week. That's not enough to pay for a Caribbean vacation, nor even finance a new car -- especially if the extra money vanishes in a couple months. $55, is, however, about what the average American spends on groceries every week. Seen in that context, it starts to become clear which types of consumers -- and companies -- might benefit immediately from a payroll tax cut. Simply put, a lot of this ""extra"" money will go to paying grocery bills, and will be spent by folks who could really use the help. Discount grocers such as Aldi and Lidl for example -- or among grocery stocks, companies like Dollar General (NYSE: DG) -- will probably be among the first companies to benefit from this payroll tax ""cut."" Furthermore, come next year when the payroll tax is no longer deferred -- indeed, when it might need to start being paid back -- demand for such discount grocers is only going to grow, pushing more and more customers through the doors of Dollar General.Other taxpayers -- and other companies -- could also win big from the payroll tax deferral, and benefit even more if, after the 2020 elections, Congress decides to expand the deferral or turn it into a true tax cut.Consider: Currently, the payroll tax cut only defers Social Security and Medicare taxes on $104,000 in annual income. But payroll taxes usually get levied on the first $137,700 of an employee's wages. (Furthermore, for employees earning over $200,000, there's an additional 0.9% Medicare tax on wages over that threshold.) Thus, the higher an employee's wages, the more money workers get to keep if those taxes are suspended or cut. In a recent report, the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy concluded that in its present form, 64% of the benefit of President Trump's payroll tax deferral is already going to the top 20% of earners. This top-loading of benefits would skew even more heavily toward high earners if all payroll taxes were deferred, or made permanent, or both. Indeed, according to CNBC, a complete elimination of payroll taxes could save earners in the $118,700-to-$263,000 income bracket an average of $3,750 per year. In such a scenario, investors might find that ritzier stock picks -- luxury jeweler Tiffany (NYSE: TIF) comes to mind, or electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) -- might benefit even more from an uptick in spending. Indeed, ""thanks"" to the coronavirus, would-be Tesla buyers mourning the end of government electric car tax breaks last year may get one last chance to benefit from Uncle Sam's generosity.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

288,"Oct 10, 2020 7:25AM EDT","Uber Technologies has traveled along a rocky road since going public in May 2019, generating a lot of headlines but few profits. The business has grown in recent years, providing nearly 7 billion trips annually, but the stock has been an underachiever.Uber is best known as a ride-hailing service, but the company has been aggressively expanding into food delivery and freight services. Those are all businesses with great potential, but so far it has not been a formula for sustained earnings.Time will tell whether Uber turns into the growth stock bulls hope it will be. In the meantime, here's why three Motley Fool contributors are ignoring Uber and focusing on XPO Logistics (NYSE: XPO), General Motors (NYSE: GM), and Stable Road Acquisition Corp. (NASDAQ: SRAC) instead.Image source: Getty Images.Lou Whiteman (XPO Logistics): Uber has neat tech and flashy marketing, but at the end of the day it is in the age-old business of getting people and things from point A to point B. Companies have been doing that for centuries, and some have proven to be a lot more successful at it than Uber.XPO Logistics is a multinational transport company that operates a fleet of trucks as well as providing logistics, brokerage, and warehousing services to large customers. The company in recent years has been investing $500 million annually in technology, creating systems to connect those in need of transport with those with the ability to provide that transport.But unlike Uber, XPO is set up in such a way that it doesn't have to deal with thorny questions about driver employment status.XPO shares have underperformed shares of Uber by about two percentage points so far in 2020, but the company offers a lot of ways to win. Its XPO Direct distribution platform is designed to help retailers better compete with the size and scale of Amazon.com by providing a full suite of distribution services. XPO is well positioned to benefit as consumers increasingly shift spending to e-commerce.Relative to its transportation peers, XPO is undervalued, trading at a discount to companies including C.H. Robinson Worldwide and J.B. Hunt Transport Services. I don't think that discount is justified, and hope to see it close in the quarters to come as the strengths of XPO's businesses are more fully understood.If not, management appears likely to explore selling its divisions off piecemeal to see if they can fetch higher valuations on the open market. One such auction is reportedly already under way, and others could follow.The bottom line for me is that in XPO I see a company that has a lot of ways to grow earnings and improve its stock price, while with Uber the path to profitability is much less clear. Yet XPO trades at less than 0.5 times sales, well below the more glamorous Uber's 4.3 times sales multiple. For my money, XPO is the much better buy.John Rosevear (General Motors): Want to invest in robotaxis? Worried about the recent reports that Uber's self-driving program is in shambles? I say that it's time to take a look at General Motors.No, wait, I'm serious! This is not your mother's GM: CEO Mary Barra has GM well positioned to not just adapt, but to thrive in an electrified, self-driving world.Consider: GM owns a big chunk of Cruise, the San-Francisco-based self-driving company that is often considered to be Waymo's closest rival. While Waymo is thought to have a software advantage, Cruise has a big advantage on hardware: Its prototype self-driving taxi is a modified Chevrolet Bolt, meaning that as soon as Cruise's software is ready to go, GM can crank out the taxis by the thousands. Uber might have a self-driving taxi someday. GM's Cruise has one now, ready to go as soon as the software is done. Image source: Cruise.But Cruise isn't the only reason to look at GM right now. Electric cars? GM has a slew of next-generation EVs on the way, all of which will use its proprietary low-cost made-in-Ohio Ultium batteries. That will help them deliver something that not even the latest Tesla can match: profitability. (And if it pans out, GM's recent deal with electric-truck maker Nikola will add scale to GM's battery operation, making it more profitable more quickly.) Meanwhile, while the COVID-19 pandemic has clobbered the traditional auto business, GM is doing quite well under the circumstances. U.S. sales have been down, but sales of GM's most profitable products -- big pickups and crossover SUVs -- have remained quite strong. And yet, while the market is assigning wilder and wilder multiples to companies like Tesla that are (at best) barely profitable, GM's stock is cruising along at around seven times its expected 2021 earnings. For investors who can see past the hype, that seems like an opportunity. Rich Smith (Stable Road Acquisition Corporation): I like to think that, here at the Motley Fool, I've developed something of a reputation as a ""play it safe"" investor. I like boring companies, cheap companies, companies with lots of free cash flow and long histories of successful operation.But today I'm going to offer up a stock idea that is none of the above: Momentus.If you haven't heard of Momentus yet, that's not surprising. Almost no one has -- and up until now, few investors would have been interested in hearing about it. Momentus, you see, is a privately owned start-up space company, whose business is building ""space tug"" spacecraft that can be used to adjust the orbits of other satellites around the Earth, and reposition them where Momentus' customers want them to be. The company first broke cover in December 2019, when it announced a deal to send up a small ""Vigoride"" space tug as part of a SpaceX payload, to demonstrate the tug's ability to shift around the orbit of other satellites being carried by the SpaceX rocket. It's slated to conduct its first commercial mission working for a paying client in December of this year, according to CNBC.  All well and good, you say. But since Momentus is privately owned and not publicly traded, why should investors care?Here's why: On Tuesday we learned that Momentus is probably going to go public in a reverse merger IPO into special purpose acquisition company Stable Road Acquisition. Analysts are forecasting that the combined company, once it begins trading, could have an enterprise value in the neighborhood of $1.2 billion -- which would make Momentus three times cheaper than Virgin Galactic, currently the only other pure-play space stock available for investment today.Is $1 billion-ish a good price to pay for Momentus? I don't know. I can't know until the company's financials are made public. But with SpaceX for a partner, a business model already proven viable by Northrop Grumman last year, and the prospect of revenue starting to come in before the year is out -- suffice it to say that the prospect of getting into this stock on the ground floor has me intrigued.10 stocks we like better than General MotorsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

289,"Oct 9, 2020 7:33PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFor years, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) was synonymous with electric car stocks. While other automobile manufacturers have toyed with electric vehicle technology, arguably none had put as much skin in the game as Elon Musk and company. But with the surge in demand for EVs, we’ve likewise seen a rapid rise in publicly traded corporations specializing in this field. But many are left wondering how to invest for growth in this exciting market without getting burned.Undoubtedly, growth investing is a pivotal component for shorter-term and longer-term strategies. Even if your goal as a young investor is to facilitate a comfortable retirement, you most likely can’t get there by playing it safe. As with anything in life – whether making a career move or buying a house – you’ve got to take risks. At the same time, you can’t just throw money at every opportunity, especially with highly variable markets like electric car stocks.Don’t get me wrong – not every EV player is a speculative affair. Some I would argue are stable companies, if not outright boring. Therefore, it’s critical to know how to invest for growth rationally. With new markets, there are undoubtedly opportunities. But with that comes the specter of the unknown.If you’re looking to buy a new car, many consumer advocacy groups will recommend that you avoid buying the first production year of a particular model. That’s because the kinks haven’t been worked out. And this becomes a greater issue if you’re dealing with cars that have integrated new technologies.It’s really the same principle on how to invest for growth. Rather than just buying the latest EV-related special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), you should investigate the target organization. Questions you may wish to ask are:These are examples of questions you should ask of any growth investing opportunity relative to its particular sector. However, with electric car stocks, the sudden rush of participation suggests that there will be at least a few losers. Here are some of the best ways on how to invest for growth profitably.Though Tesla is never a charge up away from scoring front-page news, not all of it is positive. Case in point is an incident that happened near Dublin, California. As Nathaniel Galicia Chien was driving with his parents in their right-off-the-showroom-floor Tesla Mode Y, he heard a gush of air seep in.In an interview with TheVerge.com, Chien recalled, “I thought a window was open…but half a minute later the entire glass top of the roof just flew off in the wind.” According to the local NBC news channel, the all-glass roof ripped off the chassis while the family was driving down Interstate 580.This wasn’t just embarrassing for Tesla; it very well could have been deadly. But will it impact TSLA stock? Probably not.As terrible as this defect looks, Tesla has an incredibly powerful brand. In a way, the company is like President Donald Trump. It can do whatever it wants and get away with it – well, within reason. And that’s why if you want to know how to invest for growth successfully, and especially with electric car stocks, you go with brand power.Look, Tesla’s EVs may not be all that special, as this incident demonstrates. Similarly, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) wowed the world with the iPhone but competitors have caught on. Yet Apple remains on top because of its brand. That’s a key attribute to consider for any kind of growth investing.When it comes to starting a high-traffic business, everyone recommends that you consider location, location, location. You could have the best business in the world and yet fail in the bottom line because of where your company is situated. Therefore, smart entrepreneurs will invest whatever they can to secure the best location they can afford.Not surprisingly, the same principle applies for many successful EV manufacturers. You want to see your target companies invest in the right executives and managers working in the right roles. To put it another way, it’s all about people, people, people.Although it sounds cliché, people matter. For instance, Ford (NYSE:F) is a traditional automaker that was lagging in passenger car interest. Recently, the American icon pivoted toward EVs, introducing to the public the Mustang Mach-E. From a technical standpoint, everything about this debut was top notch: the Mach-E looked amazing while providing great performance and long range.There was just one problem for automotive enthusiasts: the new Mustang was an SUV!As you know, Mustangs have always been two-door pony cars. To have the Mustang logo slapped on an SUV was a sacrilege for many. But the problem is that fewer people are buying such sports cars. To that end, Ford made the business decision to go with what was right for the company.That’s the kind of smart, forward-looking strategies you need. Therefore, if you want to know how to invest for growth, study the leadership team.If you’ve followed my work, you may get a sense that I despise mediocrity. If you don’t, well, let me tell you straight up: I despise mediocrity.Honestly, I believe mediocrity and the acquiescence to it is the single-biggest catalyst for American failure. In my view, all our troubles – racism, government corruption, moral decline, you name it – stems from mediocrity. From parents refusing to rear their children properly to grown adults always pointing the finger at something or somebody else, mediocrity drives these negative behaviors.In a similar fashion, a company’s approach to mediocrity – whether it embraces it or eschews it – represents a pivotal indicator. If you want to know how to invest for growth with reasonable probabilities, elect organizations with an innovative spirit.Among electric car stocks, one name that comes to mind is Toyota (NYSE:TM). Following the destruction of World War II, Japanese manufacturers like Toyota had to scrap for scraps. In that period of extraordinary obstacles came the mainstreaming of just-in-time inventory management. Much of the efficiencies that Toyota is known for arose from this innovation.Today, Toyota is one of the leaders in advanced EV battery technology, researching and developing solid-state batteries. Sure, Toyota could easily rest on its laurels but that’s not what its brand is about. For those seeking growth investing opportunities, look for the spirit of innovation, not mediocrity.Although the above ideas on how to invest for growth are useful for filtering out the best electric stocks for your portfolio, they have an element of subjectivity involved. For instance, the results of branding are easy to quantify: you simply look at metrics such as deliveries or average selling price. But the brand itself and the power it conveys is subjective.Some people love Tesla. And others hate the brand so much that they can’t help but deface it.However, that doesn’t mean that everything about electric stocks is subjective. For instance, I noted in early September that Tesla shares had a strong correlation with the equity price action of Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG). Granted, these are different businesses but what connects them is their development of vehicles with alternative energy.Apparently, that’s good enough for PLUG investors. And this is the primary reason why I said buying the stock is like buying TSLA for $13 (the price of PLUG at the time of writing). Earlier this month, I noted that the strong correlation still exists. Coincidentally, both stocks, while featuring different chart patterns, have the same bullish implication.Therefore, before you dive into one of the electric car stocks available, compare their performance to a proven leader like Tesla. If they generally trend along the same trajectory, you will have greater confidence in that target asset’s performance.Whether you’re trying to figure out how to invest for growth successfully in the EV market or some other unrelated sector, you should focus on the brass tacks. Especially with any technology name, don’t allow yourself to be distracted with the front-facing innovations and the marketing literature.Absolutely, listening to what a CEO has to say about his/her company is important. But objective analysis is what will keep you and your portfolio happy.To that end, I encourage anyone interested in EV growth investing to consider the business proposition. Yes, that sleek, sexy electric car or SUV may entice your heart. But without the combination of a viable business plan and target consumer market among other metrics, you may be looking at a speculative investment.Now, I’m not trying to moralize here because I’ve been known to dabble with high-risk, high-reward ventures myself. But when I do, I understand what I’m getting into.A good example to showcase is Electrameccanica Vehicles (NASDAQ:SOLO). Known for its flagship Solo, this EV gets its name because it has three wheels and only seats the driver. The reason? Electrameccanica specializes in commuter vehicles, which eliminates the inherent waste of people driving family vehicles to commute to work.For me, one of the biggest challenges is the Solo’s price. At $18,500, that might be too much for a single-purpose vehicle. Additional market research will best determine if such a business model is appropriate for your growth investing portfolio.Moving forward, one of the key questions to ask regarding how to invest for growth in the EV market is this: will the investment narrative focus on the technology or the sentiment?For full disclosure, I’ve never driven an electric vehicle nor even a hybrid so I’m not personally familiar with the driving experience. Nevertheless, I’ve spoken to many Tesla owners. And they swear that once they’ve gone electric, they’ll never go analog. Reasons for this include the whisper-quiet ride along with the various technical bells and whistles.Perhaps, though, they are enamored with the Tesla brand or the newness of the technology. But once this market becomes more fleshed out, will drivers still gawk at Tesla’s technical wizardry?Or will they instead gravitate toward companies that feature a superior driving experience? That’s one of the interesting narratives behind Spartan Energy Acquisition (NYSE:SPAQ), which is poised to become Fisker through a reverse merger. Undoubtedly, SPAQ stock is risky. However, what attracts speculators is legendary car designer Henrik Fisker, who designed the company’s gorgeous Ocean SUV.In my opinion, Fisker is a car company leveraging technology. In contrast, some of its competitors are arguably tech firms building cars.One side of this coin will probably win out but which one? Again, focused market research may give you an edge in your growth investing portfolio.Lastly, you don’t want to confine your portfolio into a corner unnecessarily. As with anything, you should keep an open mind. Life is much more interesting that way.For instance, Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) will probably never build an EV. Enrico Galliera, the Prancing Horse’s chief commercial officer, had this to say about the subject:We firmly believe that battery technology is not yet developed enough to meet the needs of a supercar. In the next five years, we do not believe the technology will be able to meet the needs of a Ferrari…As soon as electrified technology is developed, that will allow us to produce a car that fits with our position. Then why not? But the key is the technology. We will not just make a Ferrari that’s electric for the sake of it.Many EV fans took to the blogosphere to blast Ferrari as a yesteryear car company. But let’s also keep in mind that the company’s LaFerrari exotic is its first hybrid vehicle. Of course, by hybrid, we don’t mean a Prius. Instead, Ferrari is utilizing EV battery technology to bolster its combustion engine.Technically, though, this makes Ferrari somewhat of an electric car play because it’s utilizing the innovation. Perhaps not to the liking of EV buyers who are making the switch to protect the environment, but still – Ferrari’s keeping an open mind. Maybe you should too?On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in F and SPAQ.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

290,"Oct 9, 2020 5:42PM EDT","Self-driving: It's not just for Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) owners! Japanese automaker Nissan (OTC: NSANY) announced on Thursday that it will include automated driving features in all of its future models, regardless of price. In an ambitious three-year plan, the company expects to roll out 20 new models by 2023, all of which will feature some level of automated driving capability. The move comes as competition heats up among automakers of all sizes to implement advanced technology like long-range batteries, automated driving, and heads-up displays. Image source: Getty Images.Nissan, the ninth-largest automaker in the world by revenue, has had some success bringing technological innovations to market. It was the first carmaker to offer a mass-market battery-electric vehicle, the Nissan Leaf, in 2010. In 2016, the company introduced its ProPILOT 1 technology, which allowed a car to automatically follow the car in front of it while driving on the highway. That technology will come standard on Nissan's lower-priced models.More upscale vehicles, including Nissan's new Ariya battery-electric crossover SUV, will get an upgraded version of the technology, ProPILOT 2.0. Unveiled last year, ProPILOT 2.0 purports to be the world's first system ""combining navigated highway driving with hands-off single-lane driving capabilities."" The Ariya is scheduled for a 2021 release. By 2023, Nissan hopes to sell 1.5 million vehicles per year with ProPILOT technology.Rival carmakers are pursuing their own versions of the technology. Tesla plans to offer automatic tracking and lane-maintaining technology as standard equipment on its Model 3 sedans, and is considering rolling out an Autopilot subscription service. Other manufacturers offer automated-driving technology as an optional feature, or standard on higher-priced vehicles only. But Nissan's move may accelerate the race to include such features as standard on most cars.10 stocks we like better than Nissan MotorWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

As a result, the stock was up 10.3% as of 11:51 a.m. EDT on Friday.A Niu e-scooter. Image source: Niu.Niu Technologies said it sold 250,889 e-scooters in the third quarter, up 67.9% from a year ago; sales in China, where nearly all of its business comes from, were up 70.2%. The company said that growth in the China market was driven by new products, including the G0, MQi2, and MQiS models. The G0 carries a lower sales price and gross margin than other models and made up 27.6% of sales in the quarter. Year-to-date unit sales are up 43.2%, signaling an acceleration in the third quarter as the Chinese economy emerges from the coronavirus and as Niu expands its product portfolio.Niu Technologies shares have soared this year, more than tripling as it's ridden the broader rally in electric vehicle (EV) stocks  paced by Tesla. Unlike some other EV stocks, Niu is profitable, but revenue is growing more slowly than unit volume due to the introduction of lower-priced products like the G0. This strategy mirrors what Tesla has done with the Model 3, a lower-priced car than its previous products, and seems like a smart way to expand its addressable market.In Niu's second quarter, revenue grew 21.6% to $96.3 million and the company posted adjusted net income of $10.1 million. For its full third-quarter earnings report, analysts are expecting revenue of $133.7 million and adjusted earnings per share to increase from $0.13 to $0.18, though those estimates could increase after today's report.10 stocks we like better than NIU TechnologiesWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

293,"Oct 9, 2020 7:57AM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInvestorPlace’s Tezcan Gecgil recently suggested that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) faces headwinds that could see AAPL stock fall below $100 before the end of the year.If I’m Warren Buffett, I’m saying to myself, “bring it on,” because even though the iPhone maker is facing its first bit of downward pressure in 2020, the long-term consensus remains excellent for Tim Cook and Apple.Besides, we know Warren Buffett loves a good deal, so if it does indeed drop into double digits — as I write this, it’s trading around $115 — expect the Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) quarterly filings to show further additions to its Apple holdings.A MarketWatch article caught my attention while researching Buffett and his Apple affiliation. By Lawrence Cunningham, the man behind several books about Buffett, including The Essays of Warren Buffett, which was originally published in 1999, and is considered a must-read investment book.Cunningham has forgotten more about investing than most people have learned.So, I was a bit taken aback when I read his recent opinion piece that suggests Apple and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) were making a serious mistake by splitting their respective stocks.“Research conducted by the Quality Shareholders Initiative at George Washington University shows that companies with the highest-priced shares tend to enjoy the greatest proportion of QSs [Quality Shareholders],” Cunningham wrote on Oct. 7.“For instance, of the 100 highest-priced shares in the S&P 500, more than one-third are in the highest decile for QS density and more than half are in the top quarter.”I downloaded Cunningham’s forthcoming paper, The Case for Empowering Quality Shareholders, and it implies that Warren Buffett is the poster child for this initiative.“In the wider literature, the exemplar of quality shareholders are Warren Buffett and his company, Berkshire Hathaway. With a pedigree dating back to John Maynard Keynes and a following today commanding several trillions of dollars in invested assets, this cohort is vital,” Cunningham writes.But nowhere does the George Washington University professor explain why the institutional investors he names in the MarketWatch article are considered quality shareholders in the first place. He does say in his paper that Buffett considers quality shareholders to be those that “load up and stick around.”I’m left scratching my head, wondering what the Apple stock split has to do with quality shareholders. After all, Berkshire owned more than one billion shares of Apple stock at the end of June, the holding company’s largest equity position by a country mile.Apple split four for one. Therefore, assuming Buffett sold no shares in the third quarter, Berkshire now owns more than four billion shares. The market value doesn’t change, just the number of shares outstanding.It’s hard to imagine Buffett was sitting in his office on Aug. 27, the day before Apple split, thinking how much better a company Apple was at $500, than the share price the day after the split.Fundamentally, I understand the theory behind a high stock price. Still, in an age where any retail investor can own fractional shares in a company, it really shouldn’t matter whether you own four shares at $125, one share at $500, or one-quarter of a share worth $125.So, unless Berkshire starts selling its Apple shares in rapid succession, Buffett’s endorsement of Apple continues to indicate that pre- and post-split, the quality of the company’s shareholders isn’t about to change because a few more people can afford to buy a board lot.I respect Cunningham, but I think he’s making a mountain out of a molehill in this instance.Berkshire’s next 13-F filing doesn’t come out until the middle of November. My guess is we won’t see much of a change either way in the number of Apple shares held by Berkshire.That said, from the end of August through the end of September, AAPL stock lost 10% of its value, making its shares that much more attractive to someone like Buffett, who’s always happy to get a deal on a well-run company.Apple closed out September trading around $115. It hasn’t moved much in the first part of October. Should it lose another 10% to 20% of its value over the next 2.5 months, I could see Buffett adding more despite the fact it accounts for 48% of Berkshire’s equity portfolio.In recent years, Apple hasn’t gone on sale very often. If it does, look for Buffett to crash the party.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. Will Ashworth has written about investments full-time since 2008.

294,"Oct 9, 2020 7:28AM EDT","Electric bus and van company GreenPower Motors (NASDAQ: GP) began trading in the US in late August of 2020. With relatively little fanfare, its initial listing raised $37.2 million, a small fraction of the multibillion-dollar amounts that its better-known peers, Nikola (NASDAQ: NKLA), and Canoo have either raised or announced through their respective SPAC mergers. While the deal size may suggest that GreenPower's aiming too low, the company may instead pursuing a leaner, more efficient way to win.Image source: GreenPower Motor Company.For the average consumer, deciding to own a new electric vehicle, or EV -- or most mass-market vehicles for that matter -- sets in motion a number of psychological dynamics that more closely resemble purchasing fancy apparel. Generally speaking, we want vehicles that look great, surround us with creature comforts, and have the latest infotainment systems. Oh, and they should also have great specs in terms of handling, acceleration, and range -- even if we don't really need these features all that often. Metrics such as total cost of ownership, price per seat, and return on investment are, if at all, tertiary considerations for most buyers.These dynamics make the market for mass-consumption vehicles very competitive. EV makers invest heavily to make unique products. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), for example, has invested $1.3 billion or more annually -- about one-third of all of its operating expenses, or OPEX -- in research and development since 2017. In previous years, it spent closer to 50% of OPEX on R&D. Canoo, the maker of futuristic-looking EVs, claims that it has spent $250 million thus far just to make a handful of prototypes.But this level of investment to make unique products has a side effect: Companies focusing on mass markets cannot usually make products for smaller niche markets. It would take companies like Tesla or Canoo eons to get paid on their massive R&D investments if they aspired to sell only a few tens of thousands of vehicles a year.The market for medium and heavy-duty commercial EVs, or vans -- where GreenPower is aiming to succeed -- may reach only 50,000 vehicles a year by 2025, with the market for electric buses being only about half as big.GreenPower Motors has taken a different approach. Its vans and buses aren't flashy; they just work. They comply with passenger and safety standards required for their use, while delivering substantial savings in fuel and maintenance costs. While GreenPower designs its EVs from scratch, it uses off-the-shelf components and subsystems to lower its costs. The company then assembles the final product at a number of contract manufacturers and at its own factory in Porterville, California -- at an assembly line that looks very similar to those seen in Detroit. Finally, instead of hiring a large direct sales force, the company sells its EVs through Creative Bus Sales, the largest existing US network of bus retailers.This reliance on third parties has allowed the company to achieve what is called an ""asset-light"" business model -- a business that requires a lot less capital to make and sell its products. It also needs to invest a lot less in innovation: The company has spent a total of around $2 million -- yes, with an ""m"" -- in R&D since 2017.But while this business model may be cheap, it also means your products don't stand out from the crowd. Any competitor that can purchase the same standard sub-systems from the same suppliers can make a similar offering. And GreenPower's price advantage in the market will depend on its ability to maintain the largest sales volumes â otherwise, a rival with larger sales could negotiate better deals with its suppliers and overtake it in price.As far as we can tell, GreenPower Motors is counting on its leading position in a niche market to fend off would-be competitors and deliver on its financial goals. And while the market for commercial vans and busses is small in comparison to the larger passenger vehicle market, it wouldn't take much for GreenPower to grow its bottom line significantly. The company delivered 68 EVs during its fiscal year ending in March 2020, up from 40 EVs in the previous 18 months. According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, the total market for this type of EVs is estimated to be about 1,600 in 2020, so a little quick math tells us that the company was on track, pre-COVID-19, to achieve about 10% market share. If it only maintains the estimated 10% share of the market it has today, it should be able to sell about 5,000 vans and 500 buses in 2025 -- 5,500 vehicles in total, or about 80 times its 2020 unit sales. If it can hold on to its current 30% gross margins, it just has to keep its operating expenses in check to deliver a lot of value to its shareholders. And its sales ramp for the last two years, along with its asset-light model, suggests it can do just that.There are risks, of course. At this time, the EV market depends on government subsidies and regulation, for example -- the same way that other industries, including nearly all renewable energy, do. The market could grow substantially as governments double down on their commitments to clean mobility, which would attract larger competitors. And COVID-19 has definitely poured some cold water on the company's 2020 growth prospects; the company pulled all guidance for the remainder of the year during its July 20 earnings call. But in contrast to many of its would-be-competitors, Green Power has a real product that does the job and makes money, in a market niche that could grow over 30-fold in the next five years. If it just keeps executing on its simple business model, the company has a real shot at delivering substantial value to its shareholders.Investors interested in the electric mobility market should pay attention to upcoming earnings calls and look for a return to growth once COVID-19 subsides. If GreenPower can grow revenues faster than its operating expenses, Fools could expect profits ahead.10 stocks we like better than GreenPower Motor Company Inc.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

295,"Oct 9, 2020 7:13AM EDT","Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock has risen 800% over the past 12 months. Yet one analyst thinks there's still significant upside ahead for the stock. The key catalysts that could drive the stock higher? Expanding profit margins and a growing addressable market.Here's a look at this analyst's extremely bullish view for the growth stock.Image source: Tesla.Shares of Tesla could rise to $578 over the next 12 months, according to New Street analyst Pierre Ferragu, a longtime Tesla bull. This optimistic price target represents a more than 35% upside from the stock's closing price on Friday.The thesis of Tesla becoming a profitable premium car manufacturer is increasingly becoming accepted as fact, the analyst says. This differs from years past, when many investors debated whether the company would even survive. Further, Ferragu believes demand will be robust for the company, with the only limiting factor to Tesla's growth over the next five years being its ability to ramp up production. This will lead to strong pricing power and an expanding margin for this core segment, Ferragu says.Looking beyond vehicles, the analyst points to the company's growing bet on the energy market. The automaker's solar power and battery-powered energy storage products help Tesla tap into an incremental $750 billion addressable market, according to Ferragu. Tesla has said it believes that its energy business could eventually rival its auto business.Image source: Tesla.""And the mission of Tesla is to accelerate sustainable energy, so I can't emphasize enough: Yes, [Tesla's] battery and solar [businesses] will both be enormous, and they kind of have to be in order ... [for] us to have a sustainable future,"" explained Tesla CEO Elon Musk in the company's second-quarter earnings call. Musk also notes that he believes the addressable market energy is ultimately bigger than autos, creating a significant opportunity for the company to gain market share.Tesla isn't all talk when it comes to its nascent energy business. The company's new utility-scale energy storage product, Megapack, is already profitable, and orders are robust. ""[T]here's a lot of demand for the product,"" explained Senior Vice President of Powertrain and Energy Engineering Drew Baglino in Tesla's second-quarter earnings call, ""and we're growing the production rates as fast as we can for that product.""But here's the catch: Tesla's energy business still pales in comparison to its automotive business. Of Tesla's total revenue in Q2, only 6% came from energy generation and storage. Further, this segment's revenue only increased by $1 million year over year in Q2, growing from $369 million to $370 million. It's too early to know if Tesla can win in this segment the way it is in electric cars.Ferragu's optimism for Tesla stock is bold, but his upbeat view of the company's energy business should be taken with a grain of salt.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

296,"Oct 9, 2020 2:12AM EDT","With the battery design, manufacturing, and integration enhancements outlined during its battery day event conducted in late September, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) says that it could reduce the cost per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of batteries by as much as 56% over the next few years. Is this a big deal? Sure is! Using our interactive dashboard How Tesla’s Battery Costs Impact Its Gross Margins we estimate that a 56% reduction in Tesla’s battery costs could boost Automotive Gross Margins by 800 basis points, all other factors remaining equal. Tesla’s automotive gross margins are already among the best in the industry at about 21% in 2019, versus about 17% for Toyota – one of the most efficient automakers, and 10% for GM. (How Does Tesla Compare With Toyota?) By realizing these battery-related improvements and doubling down on software sales, Tesla could boost gross margins to 30%+ levels, rivaling the roughly 32% Hardware Gross Margins of  Apple – which is a benchmark of sorts in the hardware industry.Tesla’s Battery Costs Per VehicleAccording to Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF), the industry average battery costs (for both battery cell & packaging) declined from $288 to $176 between 2016 and 2018. We estimate that Tesla’s battery costs are about 20% below the industry average, driven by the company’s higher volumes and battery chemistry. This means that Battery costs for Tesla vehicles likely declined from around $230 per kWh in 2016 to $127 in 2019. Assuming that the average Tesla vehicle has a 70 kWh battery, this could imply that Tesla’s battery cost per vehicle has declined from $16k in 2016 to about $9k in 2019. Considering that the average selling price for Tesla vehicles has declined from $83k in 2016 to $57k in 2019, due to a higher mix of lower-cost Model 3 vehicles, we estimate that Tesla’s Battery Costs As % Vehicle Price dropped from 19.4% in 2016 to roughly 15% in 2019. Tesla’s Battery Costs As % of Cost of Goods Sold likely dropped from 26% in 2016 to 19% in 2019. How Battery Cost Declines Benefit Tesla’s Margins If battery costs were to decline by about 56%, as Tesla indicated during Battery Day, per kWh costs would fall from an estimated $114 in 2020 to about $50. This could reduce the cost of a battery pack to just $3,500 per vehicle, down from the $8,000 we estimate currently – a saving of about $4,500 per vehicle. At an average selling price of $54k, this would translate into an incremental gross margin of about 800 basis points. That said, it’s also possible that Tesla could actually pass on the benefits of its battery cost improvements to customers to lower the cost of its vehicles. This way, the company could increase its installed base of vehicles and better monetize its software-related sales and upgrades.What if you’re looking for a more balanced portfolio instead? Here’s a high-quality portfolio to beat the market, with over 100% return since 2016, versus 50% for the S&P 500.

297,"Oct 9, 2020 2:12AM EDT","Electric vehicle major Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is on track to report its first GAAP Net Profit in 2020, as it continues to reduce its Operating Expenses while benefiting from growing Revenues, driven by soaring vehicle deliveries as well as higher software and regulatory credit sales. Our interactive dashboard analysis on Tesla Expenses: How Does Tesla Spend Its Money? provides a detailed breakdown of Tesla’s various expenses and how they impact the company’s profitability. Parts of the analysis are summarized below.Cost of Sales: Higher Volumes, Emissions Credits, Software Sales Should Help Gross MarginsCost of Sales is the biggest driver of Tesla’s expenses, standing at 77% of Revenue in 2016 and rising to 83% of Revenues in 2019, due to the launch of the lower-priced Model 3 sedan. However, as the production scale-up of Model 3 becomes more mature, with Tesla also launching the Model Y, based on a similar platform, Cost of Sales as % of Revenue is likely to decline again to about 78% in 2020, leading to improved Gross Profits (Gross profits are defined as Revenues minus Cost of Sales). Separately, Renewable Energy Credit sales have also been a big driver of its Gross Margins in recent quarters, and Tesla’s growing software sales are also likely to help profitability. (Related: How Do Regulatory Credits Impact Tesla’s Gross Margins?) We expect Gross Margins to grow from 17% in 2019 to 22% in 2020.Operating Expenses Are Being Kept In CheckTesla’s Operating Expenses have increased from $2.3 billion in 2016  to $4.4 billion in 2018, driven largely by higher SG&A expenses, although the number declined to about $4 billion in 2019, as Tesla has been scaling back on its selling-related expenses via manpower reductions and a lower store count. Tesla is clearly improving its operating leverage, as Operating Expenses as % of Revenues have declined from 32% in 2016 to about 16% in 2019. We expect Tesla’s Operating Expenses as % of Revenue to decline further to about 13% in 2020, as the company cuts SG&A expenses further while keeping R&D spends in check. For perspective, over the first half of the year, SG&A expenses fell by about 4% year-over-year, while R&D expenses were down by about 9%. We expect Operating Margins to stand at close to 9% in 2020. Non-Operating Expenses & Net MarginsTesla’s Non-Operating Expenses, which include Interest Expenses, net of Interest Income and Other Expenses, have increased from about $80 million in 2016 to about $596 million in 2019, driven largely by higher Interest Expenses. We expect Non-Operating Expenses to grow slightly to about $630 million in 2020. Tesla’s Income Tax Expenses have increased from $27 million to $106 million between 2016 and 2019. Despite its past losses, Tesla has been paying taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions. We expect Tax Expenses to stand at about $100 million in 2020.Tesla’s total expenses have trended higher from $7.8 billion in 2016 to $25.2 billion in 2019, although they have declined, Expenses as a % of Revenues have dipped from 111% to 103%. This has meant that reported Net Income Margins have improved from around -11% in 2016 to  -3% in 2019. We expect Tesla to post Net Margins of about 6% this year, as Total Expenses as a Percentage of Revenues fall to 94%, driven by improvements to both Direct and Operating Expenses and higher Revenues. We expect Revenues to grow to close to $30 billion from about $24.6 billion in 2016, driven by growing deliveries of the Model 3 and Model Y and production in its Shanghai factory.What if you’re looking for a more balanced portfolio instead?

298,"Oct 8, 2020 9:35PM EDT","When it came to deliveries, Telsa (TSLA) delivered. Last week, the electric car maker announced that quarterly deliveries hit a new record.As a result, Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner bumped up his Q3 revenue forecast from $8.2 billion to $8.5 billion, and believes deliveries for the full year will be higher than he originally expected.It should be noted that following the company’s Battery Day event, the analyst upgraded the rating to Buy, recommending that investors “use any deliveries-related stock weakness to accumulate Tesla shares ahead of significant growth acceleration in Q4 and 2021.”Expounding on the company’s prospects, Rosner commented, “Expectations into the event were high, but Tesla in our view showcased impressive trajectory for its technology, capacity and especially cost that should help accelerate the world’s shift to electric vehicles and extend its lead considerably.”Rosner highlights the fact that investors are skeptical about the targeted timeline (three-years) to realize the full benefits of the 56% in cost savings, and were somewhat disappointed TSLA did not provide more details on the “million-mile” battery and future battery technology. That said, the analyst thinks Tesla’s plan is a “bold new attempt to inflect down battery costs much faster than their current trajectory, which could give Tesla a large competitive advantage.”To this end, the focus is now expected to shift to the near-term volume and demand trends as well as the Presidential election in November, in Rosner’s opinion. “Overall, history strongly suggests potential for material autos stock outperformance after the November election, regardless of which candidate wins,” he explained. If Biden wins, he argues “outperformance could be tilted towards stocks most exposed to vehicle electrification, and in particular TSLA.”In line with his optimistic approach, Rosner rates TSLA stock a Buy along with a $500 price target. Investors could be pocketing a gain of 17%, should this target be met in the twelve months ahead. (To watch Rosner’s track record, click here)Turning to the rest of the Street, other analysts are more cautious. With 6 Buys, 14 Holds and 10 Sells assigned in the last three months, the word on the Street is that TSLA is a Hold. At $316.69, the average price target implies 26% downside potential from current levels.

299,"Oct 8, 2020 4:53PM EDT","The stock market had another solid day on Thursday, sending the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) up by half a percent. Market participants continued to cite hope for economic support from the federal government as a key reason for their optimism about stocks.In addition, Wall Street analysts were generally upbeat on Thursday. In particular, favorable comments about Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Paychex (NASDAQ: PAYX) reflected the positive tone that the investment community has had about stocks recently.Tesla shares didn't react all that much to the latest news on its stock. The electric vehicle pioneer saw its share price inch ahead by less than 1%.Image source: Tesla.Analysts at New Street were the latest to weigh in on Tesla's prospects. The analyst company upgraded Tesla from neutral to buy, and set a price target of $578 per share on the stock.In New Street's view, Tesla has already achieved an extremely important milestone. It wasn't that long ago that many questioned whether the automaker would ever be able to turn a profit producing its own vehicles. Now, that no longer seems to be up for debate, as the company has been consistently profitable in recent quarters.The only thing limiting Tesla right now as New Street sees it is its currently constrained production capacity. As the automaker works to solve that problem with new production facilities and by obtaining the raw materials it needs, the always-controversial Tesla should be able to reach its full potential while also growing into adjacent businesses as well.Elsewhere, Paychex saw its shares respond more positively to the favorable comments it earned from analysts Thursday. The stock closed higher by nearly 2%.Paychex got an upgrade from analysts at Citi, who weighed in on the payroll services specialist after it reported its fiscal first-quarter financial results earlier this week. Citi boosted its rating from neutral to buy, and moved its price target on the stock higher by $18 to $93 per share.Citi believes that Paychex should be able to handle current industry trends well. In particular, more businesses are shifting toward automating their payroll and human capital management resources, using digital platforms that improve productivity and make it easier for people across organizations to access and share information.Some might think those trends would be a potential challenge to Paychex, however. The longtime payroll specialist faces competition from upstarts that started out with digital platforms. It'll be up to Paychex to make sure it can hang on to as many of its clients as it can, even as cloud-based companies in payroll offer some interesting advantages to woo customers away.In addition, economic concerns could slow down Paychex's future growth in the near term. Typically, Paychex feels the impact when businesses have to let their workers go. With COVID-19 pandemic-related pressures still rattling the economy, investors in Paychex need to be prepared to wait for optimal growth.Even so, Paychex's fiscal first-quarter results included limited revenue decreases of 6% and earnings that fared better than most had expected. If the payroll specialist can keep up that strong performance even under tough conditions, it bodes well for Paychex's long-term success.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

300,"Oct 8, 2020 3:27PM EDT","By Jeff LewisTORONTO, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Mineral-rich Canada has potential to become a preferred supplier of cleaner nickel to power electric vehicles (EV), miners say, as automakers scour the globe for more environmentally friendly supplies of the metal.Miners from industry giant Vale SA VALE3.SA to junior explorers Canada Nickel Co Inc CNC.V and FPX Nickel Corp FPX.V are touting low-carbon nickel in hopes of wooing automakers who have stepped up scrutiny of mining practices for key metals used in batteries, from cobalt to copper and lithium. ""We think it’s a big plus for us,"" said Mark Selby, Chief Executive of Canada Nickel, which is hoping to develop a ""zero-carbon footprint"" nickel-cobalt project in northern Ontario.Canada Nickel's planned Crawford project would tap hydropower and store carbon emissions in waste rock, although how much and at what rate requires further study, the company said. Construction of the $800 million to $1 billion mine and mill is slated for 2023 pending financing and permitting.Miner FPX Nickel has similar plans for its early stage Baptiste project in the western province of British Columbia.Such efforts are viewed by smaller companies as a competitive edge as automakers race to lock in supply and the world's top miners replenish their project pipeline.But plans hinge in part on partnerships with automobile companies and others in the burgeoning EV supply chain who remain reluctant to invest in mines, executives said.Vale's head of base metals Mark Travers said one of the big challenges in bringing the supply on is getting those mines built.He said environmental, social and governance factors are ""front and center"" in talks with Tesla TSLA.O and others keen to source supply from its Canada operations. Still, Vale is seeing some signs of progress.""The speed of these discussions and the number of discussions has really accelerated in the past few months,"" Travers told Reuters.Nickel makes batteries energy-dense so cars can run further on a single charge. Demand is forecast to double from today's levels by 2030, driven by use in EVs.Much of the supply growth is expected to come from Indonesia, where production of finished nickel is 14 times more carbon-intensive than in Canada, according to London consultancy Skarn Associates.Deposits in the South Asian country are ""inherently dirtier"" partly due to reliance on coal power for processing which could run afoul of demands for a cleaner supply chain, Selby said.""When people are looking at projects, there's now going to be a box in terms of, is this project going to help me or hurt me, in terms of my carbon footprint goals?"" he said.Canada's cleaner nickelhttps://tmsnrt.rs/30KnlMm(Reporting by Jeff Lewis Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)((Jeff.Lewis@thomsonreuters.com; +1 647 200 7236))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/canada-nickel-miners-burnish-green-credentials-in-ev-rush-2020-10-08

301,"Oct 8, 2020 2:49PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsUncertainty. Tenuous relative weakness. What’s there to be afraid of? When it comes to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), that depends on whom you ask. But when it comes to owning FB stock more confidently, getting acquainted with a hedged, risk-adjusted strategy and ‘unliking’ meddling headlines or spooky price charts has this investor’s vote. Let me explain.Shares of Facebook are among the Nasdaq Composite’s most influential leaders Thursday. FB is up nearly 2% compared to the index’s 0.55%. The gains are matched only by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and enjoy a comfortable lead over other mega-capitalization tech peers with the exception of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL,NASDAQ:GOOG).But today’s vote of confidence by FB investors has also been a long time coming amid bearish intrusions occurring off and on the price chart.Worries of 2016-style election interference vis-à-vis Facebook’s social media platform, despite its best efforts to counter bad actors of all kinds, have persisted. But the latest word the company is banning content which encourages intimidation tactics or “militarized” language which could deter a fair vote has some shareholders breathing more easily Thursday.As said, Facebook has been facing other potential threats too.Along with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet, Facebook has been in the crosshairs of regulators regarding unfair and monopolistic business practices. The House Judiciary’s Big Tech antitrust report was released late Tuesday and there’s the possibility of a Federal Trade Commission antitrust lawsuit waiting in the wings.As TheStreet.com’s Jim Cramer points out though, Facebook may be big, but really?Thriving competition such as TikTok, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Snap (NYSE:SNAP) and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) suggest something other than Facebook being a social media monopoly. What’s more and as Jim Cramer points out, there’s also the millions of small- and medium-sized businesses Facebook has helped put on the map and thrive. Could it all be a pointless or misguided political game?That’s not all. Bearish interference has also been visible on FB’s price chart to help spook investors. But those fears may also be worth less than they’re made out to be in today’s stock market.
Source: Charts by TradingViewIt wasn’t long ago Facebook stock’s technical picture had me worried. I’m much less concerned today though. Far from ‘fake news,’ a cautioned bearish monthly chart reversal pattern which broke beneath uptrend still exists. But a broad-based bullish follow-through day and healthier investing environment, which I’ve written about extensively the past couple weeks, has continued to improve. Bottom-line, it would be foolhardy to turn a blind eye.Currently, some of that improvement has manifested itself on the weekly time frame in FB shares. Last week the stock managed to confirm a bottoming candle after four weeks of lower-lows and lower-highs. This view also reflects an oversold stochastics indicator which just recently formed a bullish crossover pattern. It could be a starting point for a meaningful intermediate low. And again, with the broader market acting as support, those odds are improved.Personally, I don’t have much use for Facebook. But I can appreciate why it’s important to others and how Facebook is the type of stock suitable to be a core portfolio holding. I’m also smart enough to know when its time to ‘stand down’ as a bearish agitator.For investors that want to make something more of today’s bullish victory in shares, I’d always recommend hedging that exposure with a highly adaptable, limited and reduced risk Facebook stock collar.On the date of publication, Chris Tyler holds, directly or indirectly, positions in Pinterest (PINS) and its derivatives but no other securities mentioned in this article.Chris Tyler is a former floor-based, derivatives market maker on the American and Pacific exchanges.

302,"Oct 8, 2020 2:12PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSpecial purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), especially those that have merged with privately held electric vehicle (EV) companies, have been some of the top-performing stocks in 2020. Will that be the case here with Switchback Energy (NYSE:SBE)? It depends on how things play out in the near-term. Last month, Switchback announced its merger with ChargePoint. ChargePoint doesn’t make EVs, but stands to win big as this megatrend plays out in the coming years.How so? This company supplies the charging stations and related infrastructure for electric cars and trucks. Already a leader in its space, its sales could skyrocket over the next decade.Once the deal wraps up, it’s possible the stock (soon to re-named CharePoint Holding) takes off, much like the other SPAC names have done post-merger. Yet, while the prospects for this EV play look promising, there’s some risk shares head lower in the near-term.Namely, with investors wanting to “get in on the ground floor,” shares have soared above their $10 per share offering price, to prices as high as $16.45 per share. Sure, in recent days, shares have pulled back, and now change hands just under $14 per share.But, an additional pullback could be in the cards. The “EV bubble” hasn’t exactly popped just yet. But, with the risk interest in this sector cooling off in the short-term, a more favorable entry point could be just around the corner.That’s not to say this isn’t a solid opportunity today, but treading carefully may be the best move.Valued at $2.4 billion, ChargePoint will have $493 million in dry powder post-merger to execute its growth strategy. Right out of the gate, the EV charging infrastructure provider is already crushing the competition.With 4,000 customers, and over 115,000 charging locations, ChargePoint is getting off to a great start. And, based on estimates, it’s possible we’ll see blockbuster growth in the coming years.What am I talking about? Based on company projections, the EV infrastructure provider could see its revenue soar from around $135 million this year, to over $2 billion by 2027. Sure, there’s no guarantee things will play out as predicted. But, these numbers are reasonable given how fast electric vehicles are gaining critical mass.As InvestorPlace’s Louis Navellier wrote Oct. 6, EV passenger car sales are expected to grow from 2.1 million in 2019, to 8.5 million in 2025.With this rapid proliferation of electric vehicles, it’s clear demand for charging solutions matches up with ChargePoint’s aggressive revenue projections. But, while the bull case for this stock seems like a “no-brainer,” the risk of this year’s “EV bubble” cooling may mean it’s wise to practice near-term caution before diving into this potential long-term winner.The bull case for this EV play is a lot clearer than with other EV companies that have recently completed SPAC mergers. But, that doesn’t guarantee Switchback shares will go parabolic after the ChargePoint deal closes.Why? Sure, the “EV bubble” hasn’t popped just yet. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Nio (NYSE:NIO) have sold off a bit, but still are up massively from their 52-week lows. Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) stock has cratered. But that has more to do with issues directly related to the company, rather than decreased interest in EV stocks. Yet, we may be getting close.Since the spring, “growth at any price” has been the name of the game for electric vehicle plays. As a result, EV stock valuations have gotten way ahead of themselves. It’s impossible to estimate when it will happen, but it’s only a matter of time before this bubble bursts.The result? While EV megatrends will remain in motion, today’s frothy multiples could contract. That is to say, even if major EV names keep on “crushing it” in the growth department, their respective share prices could still trend lower from here.What does that mean for Switchback’s shares? By the time the merger wraps up, “EV mania” could be over. That doesn’t mean shares are heading to single-digits. But, the stock may not see the same parabolic moves with this stock like we have with many SPAC/EV names in 2020.The issue here is not that this hot stock is “all sizzle, no steak.” Far from it. Unlike some of the other EV stocks out there, it’s not trying to be the next Tesla. Instead, it’s honing in on what could be a lucrative segment of the EV economy.Yet, with the risk the “EV bubble” fueling the sector higher starts to cool, waiting for pullbacks may be the best way to buy Switchback.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.Thomas Niel, contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single stock analysis since 2016.The post Dive Into Switchback Energy’s Stock on Any Pullback appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dive-into-switchback-energys-stock-on-any-pullback-2020-10-08

303,"Oct 8, 2020 2:02PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSerial entrepreneur Richard Branson has a long history of reimagining different industries – and making lots of money in the process. But perhaps Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) is the most imaginative effort. Of course, the company is pioneering the emerging space tourism industry. And yes, investors can take a ride by buying SPCE stock.Yet the journey for Virgin Galactic has been challenging. Branson leveraged his Virgin Group empire to found the company back in 2004. At the time, he joined forces with Burt Rutan, who owned Scaled Composites. Unfortunately, Virgin Galactic would suffer from several major setbacks along the way. In 2007, three employees died while testing components in a rocket motor while in the Mojave desert. Then in 2014, a test flight of a rocket broke apart in midair, as one person died and another person was severely injured.But despite all this, Branson has been able to fix the problems. In fact, things have gone quite smoothly over the past few years.Branson was also smart to pull off a merger into a special purpose acquisition company. This strategy not only accelerated the process of coming public but provided the company with about $800 million in much-needed cash.Virgin Galactic has two rockets, which use reusable systems and can carry six passengers. Each one can make a trip every two months or so. As for the space flight, it involves several minutes of weightlessness and majestic views of Earth from space. For this, customers will need to shell out a hefty $250,000.So then, how big is this potential market? How many people will really do this? Well, it could be a lot.According to research from Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS), there are 41.1 million people in the world that have a net worth of $1 million to $5 million. There are also 3.6 million people who have a net worth of $5 million to $10 million. In other words, there should be enough wealthy people to turn space tourism into a billion-dollar industry.Something else that is encouraging for SPCE stock: the company has been getting traction with reservations. So far, there have been about 600 that include deposits of more than $80 million. It certainly helps that the Virgin brand is quite powerful.No doubt, one of the notable risks with SPCE stock is the novel coronavirus pandemic. It has interrupted the company’s schedules and made it more difficult for development. But then again, the pandemic still hasn’t had much impact on interest from potential customers.Interestingly, space tourism may not be the only revenue source for the company. Keep in mind that Virgin Galactic has developed a next-generation propulsion system – and it might have applications for jet planes or other space applications. This could mean that the company could tap into another multi-billion dollar opportunity. Who knows, it may even be bigger than space tourism.As should be no surprise, SPCE stock has been volatile since the company has hit the public markets. Back in February, the shares fetched more than $40. But they would then plunge to below $10. As for now, SPCE stock is trading at $21 and the valuation is at $4.5 billion.These swings will likely to continue. After all, we’ve seen this with other pioneering companies, such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).Although, for SPCE stock, there is a near-term catalyst. Next quarter, Virgin Galactic will start flights, which will certainly gin up excitement. This will probably also lead to a boost in reservations.Another advantage is that there is little competition. As a result, Virgin Galactic has the opportunity to generate substantial revenue in the next few years, which could be boosted by jet propulsion sales. So all in all, SPCE stock could be a long-term winner.On the date of publication, Tom Taulli did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.Tom Taulli (@ttaulli) is an advisor/board member for startups and author of various books and online courses about technology, including Artificial Intelligence Basics, The Robotic Process Automation Handbook and Learn Python Super Fast.

305,"Oct 8, 2020 1:48PM EDT","Just over a year ago, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos announced the ambitious purchase of 100,000 electric delivery vans from electric vehicle start-up Rivian. On Thursday, the company unveiled the new custom-designed van in a video. However, don't expect to see them in your neighborhood anytime soon. The first of the vans won't hit the road until 2021, and the initial fleet of 10,000 electric vehicles isn't scheduled to start delivering packages until 2022. Image source: Getty Images.Amazon is one of the highest-profile signatories to The Climate Pledge, a group of companies voluntarily agreeing to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. For companies with large vehicle fleets, replacing existing fossil fuel-powered trucks and vans with renewable energy-powered vehicles will be key to achieving such a goal. Although the 100,000-van Rivian order -- scheduled to be fully delivered by 2030 -- is the largest electric vehicle purchase Amazon has made to date, it's not the only one. In August, the company announced it was ordering 1,800 electric vans from Daimler's Mercedes-Benz. It has also been using hydrogen fuel cell-powered forklifts by Plug Power (NASDAQ: PLUG) in its warehouses for years. Private company Rivian is best known for its efforts to develop an all-electric pickup truck, the R1T. Although the R1T has been overshadowed by splashier headlines for Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) Cybertruck and Nikola's (NASDAQ: NKLA) Badger, Rivian may beat its rivals to market, with plans to begin deliveries of its truck in mid-2021, compared to late 2021 for the Cybertruck and late 2022 for the Badger.Other companies have also been competing with Rivian in the delivery vehicle market, with Plug Power partnering with Colorado-based Lightning Systems to develop a Class 6 delivery truck, and Tesla and Nikola both working on electric semi trucks. 10 stocks we like better than AmazonWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

306,"Oct 8, 2020 1:30PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEditor’s note: This article is part of InvestorPlace.com’s Best Stocks for 2020 contest. Eric Fry’s pick for the contest is Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX).When we last visited Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX), the global copper giant’s stock was still climbing out of last spring’s wicked stock market selloff, and the global economy was still reeling from the effects of the novel coronavirus pandemic.Economic conditions have improved somewhat since then, which has enabled many stocks to stage sparkling recoveries, including Freeport-McMoRan.It has soared 37% over the last three months — or more than four times the gain of the S&P 500 over the same time frame. For the year-to-date time frame, the comparison is similar. Freeport stock is up 20%, compared to a gain of just 5% for the S&P 500.A rallying copper price deserves most of the credit.The battery metal has delivered an electrifying performance since the steep March selloff — climbing from a four-year low near $2 a pound to a recent two-year high above $3.10 a pound. That dazzling recovery has powered Freeport’s share price to a two-year high as well.Wall Street analysts have taken notice of Freeport’s improving growth prospects and ramped up their profit forecasts for the company.Three months ago, the Wall Street consensus forecast called for Freeport to book $5.4 billion in gross profit (EBITDA) in 2021 and to produce earnings of roughly $1 per share. But the consensus now calls for $6.4 billion of EBITDA next year, on the way to $8 billion in 2023. The Wall Street crowd also boosted its 2021 earnings per share (EPS) forecast from $1 to $1.38.As you may recall, I took issue with the consensus forecast three months ago and stated flatly:I expect copper prices to continue trending higher toward $3 a pound [from $2.70 a pound] and gold prices to top $2,000 an ounce on their way to $3,000.At $3 copper and $2,000 gold, Freeport’s annual EBITDA could approach $7.5 billion.The consensus forecast has not yet reached my optimistic forecast, but it has moved decisively in that direction.And remember, a rising copper price is not the only factor that will power Freeport’s earnings growth over the next few years.The company’s massive investments to increase production at its Grasberg mine in Indonesia are just starting to bear fruit. As a result, companywide annual copper production should jump about 40% over the next two years to 4.2 billion pounds, while gold production should double to 1.8 million ounces. Those hefty production numbers could produce EBITDA well over $10 billion and EPS in the range of $2 by 2023.Meanwhile, as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk never fails to remind us, the electric vehicle revolution is producing spectacular demand growth for battery metals like nickel and copper.Back in July, he implored the world’s mining companies to boost their nickel production. Said Musk:I’d just like to reemphasize, any mining companies out there, please mine more nickel. Wherever you are in the world, please mine more nickel and don’t wait for nickel to go back to some high point that you experienced some five years ago or whatever, go for efficiency… Tesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally sensitive way. So, hopefully, this message goes out to all mining companies. Please get nickel.Over in the copper market, large supply deficits are also on the horizon, perhaps as early as next year. The story is becoming all-too-familiar: Soaring new demand from EVs and other electrification technologies, coupled with stagnant global supply growth, are creating a supply deficit in the copper market.The commodity researchers at Roskill expect total copper demand to double over the next 15 years. They forecast total copper consumption to exceed 43 million tonnes by 2035 — or nearly double the current annual global output of copper.Obviously, no one can predict the exact growth rates of the coming battery boom. But the trend is quite clear. And this trend points to booming demand for battery metals like nickel and copper.Freeport-McMoRan is perfectly positioned to cash in on this decades-long boom. Today, the stock is changing hands for around $17 a share. But as the battery metal boom continues to gain momentum over the next few years, I expect this stock to challenge its all-time high near $60 a share.On the date of publication, Eric Fry did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Eric Fry is an award-winning stock picker with numerous “10-bagger” calls — in good markets AND bad.

308,"Oct 8, 2020 11:49AM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe relationship between Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is becoming like the one between Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and General Motors (NYSE:GM).At its Oct. 7 opening price of nearly $86 per share, AMD had a market cap of nearly $100 billion on what should be sales of $7.6 billion in 2020. Intel, meanwhile, was worth about $52/share, $218 billion, on expected sales of $79 billion.The price-to-sales relationship isn’t as extreme as in the Tesla-GM example (GM is worth a small fraction of its revenue) but the disparity is becoming harder to justify. This is especially true as Intel continues to bring one-quarter of its revenue to the net income line. Intel’s growth and profitability seem to match AMD’s.So why would InvestorPlace writers like Matt McCall and Tyler Craig rather see you own AMD? There are reasons.In technology, momentum is everything. AMD chips continue to outpace those of Intel.The high end of the chip market has long been occupied by gamers, and they love AMD. The company’s share in the Steam Hardware Survey continues to expand. It’s now 25%, meaning one-quarter of PC gamers are now running AMD chips.Each new AMD announcement seems to pile pressure onto Intel. AMD plans an announcement Oct. 8 on what it calls its “Vermeer” family of processors. Tests before the announcement show these new chips are about 15% faster than the equivalent Intel processors. AMD’s line for 2021, combining graphics and processing on a single chip, are also said to be faster than what Intel is offering.The EPYC design for server chips advanced by AMD is also undergoing rapid adoption by computer manufacturers. They are combining it with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) graphics chips for artificial intelligence applications. While Intel may be in AMD’s rear-view mirror, Nvidia is far ahead of it. With expected 2020 revenue of $13 billion, that company is worth $348 billion, more than 25 times revenue.Nvidia is ahead of AMD in graphics. Its Mellanox transport fabric is making inroads in cloud data centers. And its pending purchase of ARM Holdings could make it as powerful as Intel ever was. Some analysts are now predicting the death of the x86 architecture on which Intel’s success is based, replaced by ARM architectures from Nvidia. ARM is working on chips with 192 cores, designs that could put Intel permanently in the shade.Nvidia and AMD have a long-standing “frenemy” relationship, often cooperating on sub-systems while competing fiercely in graphics. Once Nvidia closes on ARM, that could easily end because Nvidia will be able to supply its own processor needs.It would be ironic if, after years of trailing Intel, AMD overcomes it only to find itself miles behind Nvidia. But that’s how things are looking.The last few years have seen a frenzy for chip stocks with valuations that go to infinity and beyond. Nvidia’s current valuation makes no sense to me, and I recently took some money out of it, putting it in Intel.Right now, that looks like a mistake.Fundamentals do matter, however. As good as Nvidia chips may be, the company isn’t worth 25 times revenue. No company is. I even find reasons to question AMD’s valuation, 13 times revenue, 169 times last year’s earnings. Both companies are also production limited, dependent on Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), their fabricator, for their growth. Even if Intel chips are second rate, they have manufacturing plants that can meet cloud supply and the low-cost production of good enough product.But you don’t argue with the tape. Values are what they are, not what you’d wish them to be. AMD stock is up 90% in 2020, while Intel is down 12%. A speculator should avoid Intel, but an investor approaching retirement can have things both ways. Keep some money in Nvidia or AMD and keep an eye on it. Leave your Intel alone and take the dividends. Balance will come in time, and you’ll have profits either way.On the date of publication, Dana Blankenhorn owned shares in NVDA and INTC.Dana Blankenhorn has been a financial and technology journalist since 1978.

Citing sources from ""the highest level"" who ""can confirm"" this fact, Electrek proceeded to report that Tesla has officially ""dissolved its PR department,"" and now literally has nobody on staff responding to inquiries from the press.Image source: Getty Images.In part, Tesla's move appears to have happened by accident, but in part, it happened by design. As Electrek notes, former Tesla PR head Keely Sulprizio left Tesla to join the staff at Impossible Foods in December 2019, and senior global communications manager Danielle Meister departed for WhatsApp in April.Other folks who previously handled press inquiries have shifted into new roles within Tesla itself. Senior manager Gina Antonini, for example, is now Tesla's director of external relations and employee experience. Former communications manager Alexander Ingram now works for Tesla's design studio, and PR staffer Rich Otto has become a product manager. Another communications alumnus, Alan Cooper, first switched departments in February -- then left the company entirely.Still, you'd think that if Tesla were interested in talking to the press, it would have little difficulty finding replacements -- but apparently, Tesla is in fact not interested. Electrek notes that Tesla CEO Elon Musk complains often about Tesla's treatment in the press. Now, it appears he's decided to simply cut off contact with the media entirely.So how people supposed to ask Tesla questions when they have them nowadays? Well, according to the website at least, Tesla still has an email address for press inquiries: Press@Tesla.com, and a separate address for investor queries: IR@Tesla.com.If you've ever got questions for Tesla, drop them a line. And cross your fingers.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

310,"Oct 8, 2020 8:39AM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips2020 is the year of the special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs). And another new entrant to the field, SwitchBack Energy Acquisition (NYSE:SBE), is garnering attention. It makes perfect sense why. Unlike so many SPACs, SwitchBack is buying a company, ChargePoint, which has an already-proven product and more than $100 million in annual revenues.ChargePoint seeks to revolutionize the electric vehicle (EV) industry by making vehicle charging a painless, hassle-free experience. So far, its plan seems to be working.Traders are buying into the story as well; SwitchBack’s shares have surged 32% over the past month. However, it’s worth looking at the fine print before placing a buy order.What is ChargePoint’s value proposition? Simply put, the company wants to build the hardware that can replace gas stations. Large dedicated charging stations for electric vehicles haven’t necessarily been a great market fit.So ChargePoint is trying things a different way. It sells little charging units that you can set up next to each parking space (like parking meters, only for energy). ChargePoint doesn’t buy or sell electricity or deal with grid management or that stuff. It simply provides the charging unit and the software to operate it. The host — such as an employer who puts these units in their parking lot for employees — is then responsible for the electricity and choosing whether end users pay for it or not.ChargePoint intends to build a large recurring revenue business. By getting its units installed in parking lots and side streets around the nation, it can get a big base. Then it gets to charge a monthly fee for keeping them operating. Needless to say, this could be a huge business if EV adoption is anywhere close to projections.It’s easy to make a breezy bull case for this sort of stock. Electric vehicles are the wave of the future. Thus, isn’t charging technology an inevitable way to play the trend? A stock like this practically sells itself just listening to the story.Once you dig in deeper, however, there are a number of glaring issues that emerge. For one, the company is barely getting started. It shipped 32,000 units last year, and generated $147 million of revenues in 2019. Both figures are actually set to decline in 2020 because of the pandemic. The company projects 60% growth annually indefinitely after this bump, but based on the company’s past modest results, this seems excessive.The valuation, in light of the above figures, is shocking. At the $10 SPAC deal price, SBE was trading for a $3 billion valuation once the deal closes. With shares at $15, this figure has gone up even more. I know we’re in a market where valuation doesn’t matter, but $3 billion+ for $147 million of annual revenues at fairly modest gross margins is still something else.That’s far from the only issue. In fact, if you turn to page 37 of their Sept. 23 slide deck, you find a true stunner.ChargePoint lays out a comparable analysis deck of companies it perceives as similar to itself. Some of these comparables, like solar power companies, make sense. Some are a stretch — Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is quite a different beast than ChargePoint, and it’s pretty bold to claim Musk’s empire as a peer business.However, the real shocker is Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON). In what universe is ChargePoint a comparable company to Peloton? How can you possibly say a fitness company and a car-charging start-up are peers? Needless to say, if you use that much latitude to select your comparable companies, you can flatter yourself in the ensuing analysis.Even after those carefully-selected peers, there’s more. That’s because — get this — ChargePoint uses 2021 earnings for Tesla, Peloton and other peers and compares them to 2026 project results for Chargepoint. 2026! Of course your stock is going to look cheap if you pencil in five years of incredible growth for yourself while your peers are busy using today’s numbers while fending off a pandemic.A company running a traditional initial public offering (IPO) would not use this brazen of marketing tactics. The Securities and Exchange Commission regulates forward guidance on IPOs pretty heavily, and besides, investment banks don’t want to be the butt of jokes if their underwritten companies fail to perform.SPACs, however, are the wild west. Regulation hardly exists, and the companies going public can use just about any old trick to make the numbers sparkle. If that includes a nonsensical line-up of “peers” and imagined numbers from the year 2026, why not? With SPACs, it’s all fine.As such, it’s caveat emptor; buyer beware with all SPACs, especially this one. I don’t hate the business model, but the valuation is stretched and the marketing is overly aggressive. There are also competitive risks. ChargePoint is far from the only charging company out there. And future innovations, such as wireless charging, could make this line of business obsolete in the years to come.This is a promising company. However, the valuation now is totally detached from anything realistic. Furthermore, management is really putting the best possible spin on its numbers and competitive market position. Once the shine wears off, expect share to trade at a more reasonable price.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Ian Bezek has written more than 1,000 articles for InvestorPlace.com and Seeking Alpha.

312,"Oct 8, 2020 7:04AM EDT","Value traps are companies that may seem cheap at first glance, but get progressively cheaper and cheaper until their stock destroys all the wealth investors can put into them. Such phenomena are quite common for companies that enduring considerable declines in their core operations, or are cooking their books to make their business look more attractive. From a company that fabricated its financials, to another that's embroiled in insider trading controversy, to another that faces allegations that its technology is non-existent, the stocks all have one thing in common: having fallen from great heights and appearing deceptively undervalued. Let's look at why these companies are value traps and why investors should avoid them. Image source: Getty Images.Luckin Coffee (OTC: LKNC.Y) had high hopes of disrupting the Chinese coffee industry. Founded in 2017, the company began on a journey of rapid expansion across China, opening nearly 5,000 stores across the country by the end of 2019, eclipsing Starbucks' goal of opening 6,000 stores in the Middle Kingdom by the end of 2022. However, that dream came crashing down in April as an internal review of its financials found its COO had fabricated at least $310 million of its $732 million in revenue last year. In addition, short-seller Muddy Waters conducted an independent investigation of the company that found it relied on mass distribution of free coffee coupons for the sake of growth. At one point in time, Luckin Coffee allegedly gave nearly half of its coffee for free to solicit new customers, while its core members received no such perks for their loyalty. The Nasdaq stock exchange has delisted the stock for failing to file its financial statements since the third quarter of 2019. Since its all-time high in April, the stock is now down over 90%. For investors who find it tempting to buy the dip, however, there are many reasons to stay away from the stock. Most crucially, it is simply not the cultural norm for people to drink coffee in China, where the average Chinese person only drinks 0.014 cups of coffee per day. That's astonishingly low compared to the 1.1 cups of coffee the average American drinks on a daily basis. Keep in mind, the reason behind the company fabricating its financials was to ""demonstrate"" that it had the potential to outcompete Starbucks. Now that the house of cards has come crumbling down, it is difficult to see how Luckin coffee can generate genuine consumer traffic at thousands of its stores. With so many players in a hypercompetitive market, the worst is probably yet to come for Luckin coffee. In late July, shares of digital camera company Eastman Kodak (NYSE: KODK) looked like they were finally about to turn around seven years of underperformance, with the announcement that the Department of Defense (DoD) will be awarding the company a $765 million loan for it to manufacture generic drug ingredients. Fast forward three months later, and Kodak stock is once again going through tough times, after allegations of rampant insider trading in anticipation of the deal announcement and questionable tax avoidance tactics by one of its board members forced the DoD to halt the deal. In September, a law firm hired by Kodak cleared the company of any wrongdoing, which ironically brings up a new problem of conflict of interest rather than inspire confidence. The company is still pending outcomes of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Even if the company miraculously gets the loan back, take note that it's still a loan as opposed to an equity investment. The generic drug sector is already highly saturated as it is. Suppose Kodak invests hundreds of millions in new manufacturing facilities and sees little return on investment. In that case, it has little chance of paying back the DoD, as a $765 million debt is almost 64 times the size of Kodak's annual cash flow. Unfortunately, the advent of smartphones is rapidly rendering digital cameras archaic, as well as squeezing out traditional photo printing services. During the second quarter of 2020, Eastman Kodak's revenue decreased from $307 million in second quarter 2019 to $213 million, while its non-cash operating loss (EBITDA) increased from $1 million to $7 million over the same time period. The stock is now down nearly 85% from its high of $60 per share in July. At one point in time, electric car company Nikola's (NASDAQ: NKLA) market cap soared to as much as $34 billion after it disclosed that it discovered a breakthrough in vehicle battery technology. Unlike its competitor Tesla Motors, however, Nikola did not disclose the chemical composition of its supposed battery, nor any information about which university it partnered with to develop the technology. With the help of short-selling firm Hindenburg Research digging through some financials in September, it turned out that Nikola made its breakthrough claim days before it signed a letter-of-intent to acquire car battery start-up ZapGo, who in turn boasted that they had developed a groundbreaking carbon-ion battery that is significantly more energy efficient than commercially available variants. Before the acquisition could go through, ZapGo's President of U.S. Operations resigned over prostitution and tax fraud allegations. The two companies are now embroiled in a lawsuit with Nikola alleging ZapGo made false or misleading statements regarding its technology. ZapGo took the initial steps to declaring insolvency in July, which is highly uncanny for a company possessing a major technological advancement. We will not know for sure until after the fact whether or not Nikola actually has the capacity to deliver its promise on a revolutionary battery. The odds, however, are not good. According to General Motors employees who have witnessed Nikola's operations, the company's battery and fuel technology were inferior to that of General Motors'. Both the SEC and the Department of Justice are investing allegations of misconduct against Nikola. If drowning in controversy isn't enough, Nikola's financials are also nothing to be excited about. In the second quarter of 2020, the company generated just $36k in revenue, compared to a stunning net loss of $100 million. That's mind-boggling for a company with a market cap of $9 billion. In just four months, shares are down over 70% from its high in June. 10 stocks we like better than Eastman KodakWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

313,"Oct 8, 2020 6:19AM EDT","After both Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) split their stocks last month, investors rightly wondered whether another high-flying stock, Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN), would also split its shares.After all, with its shares at over $3,100 apiece, now would seem an opportune time to jump on the bandwagon. But I don't think Amazon will. Despite having split its shares three times in the past, the situation today is much different, and it appears Amazon is happy to remain a high-priced stock.Image source: Amazon.com.It's been more than 20 years since Amazon divvied its shares to make them more attractive to investors, and the e-commerce giant was still relatively new to the public markets back then.Amazon's initial public offering was in May 1997. A year later, the company split its stock 2-for-1, when it was trading at only $85 per share and it had a market cap of less than $5 billion. Just seven months later, it split again 3-for-1, after the shares had rocketed to $355 a piece. Eight months after that, in September 1999, it split for the third and last time, 2-for-1, when the stock was trading under $120 each.Since then, Amazon has been on an astronomical tear. In the 21 years that followed, the stock has risen by more than 5,200%, compared with a 158% gain for the S&P 500. And its market cap has increased from $20 billion to almost $1.6 trillion, a 7,800% expansion, for a compounded annual growth rate of 23%.AMZN data by YChartsAn investor would be hard put to find a better performing stock, yet over the past two decades as Amazon's business has both grown and improved, and its stock continued to climb into the stratosphere, the e-commerce giant has chosen not to split its stock again.Amazon was a much different company the last time it split its stock. Still primarily the ""world's biggest bookseller,"" in 1999 Amazon had only recently expanded into selling music CDs, and it was just adding a few more categories to its selection, including, toys, electronics, and tools. By December of that year, the e-commerce company had shipped a total of 20 million items,  and it generated total revenue of just over $1.6 billion.To put that into perspective, during its annual Prime Day shopping extravaganza event last year, Amazon sold over 175 million products. For the full year, Amazon had $280.5 billion in sales, meaning it took just the first two days of 2019 for its revenue to match the entire year's worth of sales in 1999. Of course, the Amazon of today is more than just books, toys, electronics, or tools, and you can find just about anything you want to buy on the website.But it's also just more than about e-commerce. While shipping its products keeps the U.S. Postal Service operational, Amazon Web Services (AWS) generated $35 billion in sales, or about 12% of the total, yet represented 63% of Amazon's $14.5 billion in operating profit.AWS has become the backbone for the online platforms of numerous other retailers and businesses, including the U.S. government. It controls a market-leading 31% share of cloud services, followed by Microsoft Azure at 20%, Alphabet's Google Cloud with 6%, and Alibaba at 5%.Amazon also has its own fleet of delivery cars and vans, its own fleet of airplanes and trucks, even container ships. It also operates more than 175 operating fulfillment centers and more than 150 million square feet of space to ship products.Because Amazon encompasses far more than simply a consumer-facing business, even if that's what it's most recognized as, it doesn't need to make itself accessible to retail investors anymore.In 1999, Amazon was trying to make its mark against Barnes & Noble, but today it's involved in almost every segment of the economy. Its products and services are literally almost too numerous to mention, which means it can be complacent about being available only to most retail investors as a fractional investment through services like Robinhood and WeBull.A split doesn't really matter to an investor anyway, as that investor's stake in the company remains the same. It all depends upon whether you like your pizza cut into eight slices or 16 -- it doesn't change the size of your pie.Still, after 20 years and thousands of percentage-point increases later, it's safe to say Amazon.com won't be splitting its stock anytime soon -- though that doesn't mean its stock isn't still a buy.10 stocks we like better than AmazonWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

314,"Oct 8, 2020 5:51AM EDT","Investing in 2020 has been an adventure. In a roughly six-month span, the widely followed S&P 500 lost over a third of its value, clawed everything back, and even gained. It was the steepest 30%-plus bear market decline we've ever seen, as well as the quickest rebound to new highs from a bear market bottom in history.Besides giving long-term investors opportunities to scoop up great companies at bargain prices, this heightened volatility has also lured millennial and/or novice investors into equities. Online investing app Robinhood, which is best known for its commission-free trades and gifts of stock shares to new members, has signed up millions of people. The average age of these new short-term-focused traders is 31. Unfortunately, not all of the companies that Robinhood investors flock to are Wall Street favorites. Wall Street hates the following three stocks that you can find among Robinhood's top 50 holdings.Image source: Getty Images.It's no secret that millennial investors are enamored with electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers, and none is more popular than Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). Robinhood's investors are known to chase momentum stocks. Since Tesla was recently up over 1,000% on a trailing-12-month basis at one point, it fits the profile.Yet Tesla isn't that well-liked on Wall Street. Keeping in mind that underperform and sell ratings are rare (often because investment banks don't want to burn bridges with the companies they're rating), September featured eight strong buy or buy ratings, 15 hold ratings, and 10 underperform or sell-equivalent ratings. Put another way, fewer than 1 in 4 Wall Street analysts views Tesla as a stock to buy right now.Why the skepticism? One reason might be Tesla's lack of a full-year generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profit. Tesla has often leaned on EV credit to bolster its adjusted profitability, but hasn't been able to generate a full-year GAAP profit. That's a bit worrisome for a company valued at almost $400 billion.Tesla's valuation is also a tough pill to swallow. Putting aside its triple-digit forward price-to-earnings ratio for a moment, Tesla is on track to deliver roughly 500,000 EVs in 2020. Comparatively, other major auto stocks are producing anywhere from 3 million to 8 million vehicles annually. Tesla's valuation is nearly equal to many of the largest traditional automakers put together, yet it remains unprofitable on a full-year GAAP basis.Tesla is a stock I wouldn't buy because I also question the sustainability of its competitive advantages. Tesla has certainly benefited from its first-mover advantage in mass-produced EVs and its battery range. But it's not going to be the only show in town. General Motors, Ford, and pretty much every major automaker is tossing billions (or tens of billions) of dollars at EVs and autonomous vehicles in the coming years. I'd say Wall Street is right to question Tesla's valuation here.Image source: Getty Images.Millennial and novice investors are also gung-ho on marijuana stocks, with Canadian licensed producer Aurora Cannabis (NYSE: ACB) once holding the title of most-held stock on the entire Robinhood platform.However, there's been a pretty clear bifurcation on favorability when it comes to North American pot stocks. Weed companies in the U.S. are thriving, while our neighbors to the north are struggling badly. That's meant little love for Aurora Cannabis. According to Robinhood, only 17% of analysts currently have a buy rating on Aurora, with 78% at hold and 6% at the equivalent of a sell rating.It's certainly not hard to see why Wall Street is skeptical of the company. Since mid-March 2019, Aurora Cannabis' stock has lost more than 96% of its value. Once expected to lead North America in marijuana output, Aurora has closed five of its smaller cultivation farms, halted production on its two largest projects to conserve capital, and sold its greenhouse in Exeter, Ontario, which it never retrofit for cannabis production. Though Aurora is selling more cannabis of late, its value brands are dominating those sales, which means operating margins are hurting.Though at least some of Canada's shortcomings can be blamed on regulatory issues, problems specific to Aurora deserve a wag of the finger from investors. The company has been issuing stock in droves to raise capital for funding acquisitions and day-to-day operations. In six years, Aurora's reverse-split-adjusted share count has ballooned from 1.3 million to 115.2 million, meaning it's constantly diluting existing shareholders.Aurora also grossly overpaid for each and every one of its acquisitions since August 2016. In fiscal 2020, the company wrote down well over $2 billion Canadian in goodwill and intangible assets tied to these deals.Aurora Cannabis has shown little to inspire confidence and should be avoided.Image source: Getty Images.Robinhood investors are also fans of Big Oil. Integrated oil and gas giant ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) is a top-50 holding on the platform that Wall Street doesn't exactly love.In September, 25 Wall Street analysts had a rating issued on the company, with two calling it a strong buy, 18 labeling it a hold, and five designating the company an underperform or sell. That's less than 10% of Wall Street investment banks believing ExxonMobil was worth buying as of last month.Why no love for ExxonMobil? In the short run, the company is contending with a historic plunge in crude oil demand tied to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Although economic activity is rising, there's no way for any developed economy to fully step on the gas until there's a workable vaccine. This means continued pressure and potential oversupply on crude demand for the foreseeable future.The other problem is the continued push toward renewable energy sources in developed countries. Make no mistake, oil isn't going away anytime soon -- but the developed world's reliance on fossil fuels may begin to wane, putting ExxonMobil's future growth prospects into doubt.For what it's worth, ExxonMobil is the only one of these three hated stocks that I believe is worth buying. As an integrated company, it's able to lean on its downstream refining and petrochemical operations when crude prices weaken. It also has ample production opportunities overseas to meet developed and emerging market demand.This is the first time in 35 years that ExxonMobil has been so cheap relative to its book value. In my view, this makes it a compelling buy at its current price.10 stocks we like better than ExxonMobilWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Eight years later, former Vice President Joe Biden has again put GM, and its union workforce, at the center of his rhetoric.The 2009 bailout is mentioned regularly. Biden announced his economic plan in front of a former GM plant. His “Buy American” plan could assure a steady flow of government contracts. The relationship seems close. Biden seems to know all about the new Corvette. But is this something you can invest in?GM opens for trade Oct. 8 at about $31.60 a share, a market cap of $45.2 billion, after 2019 sales of $137 billion. The June quarter was a disaster, but analysts now expect sales of $37 billion in the third quarter report Nov. 5, and net income of $1.35 a share.GM stock looks cheap, but rival Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has left it for dead, because GM looks miles behind on electric cars.GM continues to insist it will have 22 new EVs by 2022, and claims some will get 400 miles between charges with a new “Ultium” battery.But Tesla is now worth 9x more than GM, $385 billion, despite having less than one-fifth its sales. Analysts see Tesla dominating the new supply chains of electrics and are buying its story of cars being products of technology, not manufacturing.Biden’s policy would support GM’s efforts to compete, with investments in charging stations, tax credits, and new fuel economy standards. Such policies could give GM the time and money needed to bring its electrics to market, retooling factories and rebuilding supply chains.If you believe that, and political analysts are skeptical, then GM stock is a very cheap stock. Right now the third quarter looks good, with sales down just 10%, mainly due to short inventory. Despite all the talk about electrics, people are still buying GM pick-ups. Leaner inventories should also mean more profitable sales.The old GM was a manufacturing and finance company. The new GM will be a manufacturing and technology company. The company expects billions of dollars in profit from defense contracts. That’s money it can put into its $2.3 billion battery plant in Lordstown, Ohio, being built with South Korea’s LG.Meanwhile, GM continues to move away from finance. It will get $2.5 billion selling its credit card unit to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). Goldman also says it will make GM’s credit card an “e-commerce portal,” handling financing on car purchases. Moving big credit decisions and payments online, as companies like Repay Holdings (NASDAQ:RPAY) already do, could accelerate car purchases.Finally there’s the on-again, off-again relationship with Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA). GM announced its plan to take equity and make Nikola trucks last month.  Now Nikola and its founder are surrounded by charges of fraud. The two companies are negotiating, but it could result in GM getting more control over both the design and manufacturing at the truck company, which still carries a market cap of almost $9 billion.GM stock has been hammered in 2020. The dividend is gone, the shares are down 16%. Tesla has blown past it.But there’s still value in GM. Politicians don’t want it to go away. They have the means to keep it in the game against Tesla. Defense contracts, purchase incentives, and “buy American” plans for batteries and assembly plants may get GM through its present difficulties.If they can, there’s no reason why GM stock should still be selling for 0.25x sales while Tesla sells for 20x. That ratio should change in GM’s favor.Dana Blankenhorn has been a financial journalist since 1978.

316,"Oct 8, 2020 4:02AM EDT","Vehicle leasing could represent a large and lucrative opportunity for Tesla in the long-run. Just about 1 in 20 Teslas delivered in Q2 2020 were leased, compared to about 1 in 4 vehicles in the U.S. which are leased, giving the company a lot of room to scale up. Tesla’s leases are also likely to be more lucrative for the company, as its leases are more expensive compared to rivals, and the company’s vehicles also hold higher residual value. Below is a bit more about where Tesla’s leasing business stands and how it impacts Tesla’s financials. View our interactive dashboard analysis How Tesla’s Expanding Leasing Business Reflects On Its FinancialsTesla’s Leasing BusinessLeases help to bring down the upfront cost of owning a vehicle and come with tax benefits. Monthly lease payments are also typically lower than loan payments.  Tesla’s Lease Sales as % of Vehicle Deliveries have grown from 3% in Q3’18 to over 9% in Q3’19, as Model 3 was added to the company’s leasing program. However, the number declined to about 5% as of Q2 2020, likely due to lower interest rates which could be making people opt for financing over leasing. That said, if interest rates remain low, Tesla could cut lease rates, making its leasing program more attractive. The recent addition of the Model Y SUV to Tesla’s leasing program could also help Tesla lease more vehicles.How Leases Impact Tesla’s Automotive RevenuesTesla only recognizes the monthly operating lease payments when it leases a vehicle, versus recognizing the full selling price for vehicles that are financed or bought outright. However, lease revenues are much more stable, as they include payments from vehicles leased in prior periods as well. Tesla’s Lease Revenues grew about 30% year-over-year to about $268 million in Q2’20, despite the fact that the number of leased vehicles over the quarter declined. Tesla had about 55k vehicles under lease as of Q2’20, up from 39k vehicles in the year-ago quarter. How Leases Impact Tesla’s MarginsTesla’s Gross Margins for Leases stood at 45%, well ahead of Automotive Sales Gross Margins of 24% in Q2 2020. Gross Margins for leases are higher likely due to the fact that Tesla keeps the vehicles on its balance sheet with the Cost of Sales on leases primarily relating to the depreciation of the leased asset. It’s possible that some expenses are being excluded compared to outright sales, which account for all manufacturing-related costs.Tesla’s Electric Vehicles Are Great For LeasingResidual values on Teslas hold up far better than other vehicles. For example, per data from iSeeCars, a Tesla Model 3 lost just about 5% of its value within one year, versus about 14% for a Honda Accord and a whopping 38% for a BMW 3 Series. A similar trend can be seen if we compare the Model S and X with competing luxury vehicles. This means that at the end of a lease, Tesla still has a valuable asset that can be sold or used for the company’s planned Robo taxi fleet. This is likely due to the lower wear and tear associated with electric vehicles, Tesla’s periodic software updates – which keep adding features, and the low running costs. The higher residuals and longer life could also give Tesla the flexibility to cut lease payments further, making it more attractive to customers.What if you’re looking for a more balanced portfolio instead? Here’s a high-quality portfolio to beat the market, with over 100% return since 2016, versus 50% for the S&P 500. Comprised of companies with strong revenue growth, healthy profits, lots of cash, and low risk, it has outperformed the broader market year after year, consistently.See all Trefis Price Estimates and Download Trefis Data hereWhat’s behind Trefis?

317,"Oct 7, 2020 9:29PM EDT","Oct 7 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Wednesday the company will produce Model Y with a new structural battery design and technology at its Berlin factory next year and that could result in a ""significant production risk"".The U.S. electric carmaker plans to manufacture a new version of its Model Y crossover vehicle, and possibly even battery cells at the site. Last month, Musk said that Tesla will use its Germany-based plant to demonstrate a radical overhaul of how its cars are built. The company plans to start the production of Model Y at Gigafactory Berlin during the second half of 2021.Tesla's new battery cell - a larger cylindrical format called 4680 that can store more energy and is easier to make - is key to achieving the goal of cutting battery costs in half and ramping up battery production nearly 100-fold by 2030.The company's new structural battery pack requires the new 4680 battery cells in order to work.Musk said on Wednesday that it will take about two years for  Tesla factories in Fremont and Shanghai to embrace the new technology.""Fremont and Shanghai will transition in 2 years when new tech is proven,"" Musk said in a tweet.The company said last week that it delivered 139,300 vehicles in the third quarter, a quarterly record for the electric carmaker. Tesla's delivery push has been supported by its new Shanghai factory, the only plant currently producing vehicles outside California, as it is also building a new vehicle and battery manufacturing facility near Berlin.(Reporting by Sabahatjahan Contractor and Kanishka Singh in Bengaluru, Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips)((Sabahatjahan.Contractor@thomsonreuters.com; within U.S. +1 646 223 8780 outside the U.S.  +918067492635;))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/musk-says-tesla-to-use-new-batteries-tech-at-berlin-factory-flags-production-risk-2020-10

318,"Oct 7, 2020 5:57PM EDT","By Paul LienertOct 7 (Reuters) - Tesla co-founder J.B. Straubel wants to build his startup Redwood Materials into the world's top battery recycling company and one of the largest battery materials companies, he said at a technology conference Wednesday.Straubel aims to leverage two partnerships, one with Panasonic Corp 6752.T, the Japanese battery manufacturer that is teamed with Tesla TSLA.O at the Nevada gigafactory, and one announced weeks ago with e-commerce giant Amazon AMZN.O.With production of electric vehicles and batteries about to explode, Straubel says his ultimate goal is to ""make a material impact on sustainability, at an industrial scale.""Established in early 2017, Redwood this year will recycle more than 1 terawatt-hours' worth of battery scrap materials from the gigafactory — enough to power more than 10,000 Tesla cars.That is a fraction of the half-million vehicles Tesla expects to build this year. At the company's Battery Day in late September, Chief Executive Elon Musk said he was looking at recycling batteries to supplement the supply of raw materials from mining as Tesla escalates vehicle production.Redwood's partnership with Panasonic started late last year with a pilot operation to recover materials at Redwood's recycling facilities in nearby Carson City, according to Celina Mikolajczak, vice president of battery technology at Panasonic Energy of North America.Mikolajczak, who spent six years at Tesla as a battery technology leader, said: ""People underestimate what recycling can do for the electric vehicles industry. This could have a huge impact on raw material prices and output in the future.”Straubel's broader plan is to dramatically reduce mining of raw materials such as nickel, copper and cobalt over several decades by building out a circular or “closed loop” supply chain that recycles and recirculates materials retrieved from end-of-life vehicle and grid storage batteries and from cells scrapped during manufacturing.In September, Redwood said it received funding from Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, following an investment by Breakthrough Energy Ventures, backed by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Microsoft founder Bill Gates.“I’m excited about the work we can do together,” Straubel said of Amazon. “They have batteries in many devices,” from consumer electronics to data centers, as well as future electric delivery vehicles and drones.(Reporting by Paul Lienert in Detroit; Editing by David Gregorio)((Paul.Lienert@thomsonreuters.com; mobile +1 313-670-2452;))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ex-tesla-exec-straubel-aims-to-build-worlds-top-battery-recycler-2020-10-07

320,"Oct 7, 2020 3:08PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe lithium boom is creating incredible opportunity with lithium stocks.All thanks to an electric vehicle (EV) boom that’s showing no signs of cooling off.In fact, there’s so much demand for lithium, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) just signed a lithium ore supply deal with Piedmont Lithium (NASDAQ:PLL).Plus, as reported by Barron’s contributor Al Root:“There’s only one thing standing between Tesla and world domination, the global supply of lithium. And that’s good news for lithium producers. Right now, the world mines roughly 400,000 tons of lithium a year, enough to power 2 million to 3 million electric vehicles, though only a third of that goes to EVs right now. That number will have to increase perhaps as much as tenfold to meet Musk’s goal, and that doesn’t take into account other automakers.”In addition, global governments are providing a big catalyst for lithium.California Gov. Gavin Newsom just signed an executive order that will ban the sale of gas-powered passenger cars in the state starting in 2035, for example.Plus, consider this. Without lithium, the electric vehicle story could be stopped dead in its tracks. With big demand, I’m again noting these are some of the top ways to trade the boom with these lithium stocks.The last time I weighed in on the LIT ETF, it traded at just $36.63. That was on July 21.As I wrote at the time, this exchange traded fund “invests in the full lithium cycle from mining and refining to battery production.” The fund contains 42 holdings, with another member of this list – Albemarle – at the top with nearly 10% of the fund’s weight.Now the ETF is up to $41.50 and could easily explode higher. All because it’s very well diversified with full lithium stocks from mining and refining to battery production. The best part – at less than $42 per share, the LIT ETF is offering you exposure to heavyweight stocks, like Albemarle and Tesla.On July 21, I also highlighted opportunity in Lithium Americas Corp. At the time, it traded at just $5.85. It’s now up to a nearly $15 per share.Lithium Americas Corp. operates as a resource company in the United States, with interests in the Cauchari-Olaroz Project in Jujuy province of Argentina and owns a 100% interest in the Thacker Pass lithium project in northwestern Nevada.  In addition, the company announced it completed its transaction with Ganfeng Lithium Co. Ltd. with respect to their joint venture company, Minera Exar S.A.“The transaction with Ganfeng Lithium further strengthens our long-term partnership in Argentina as we work together to bring Caucharí-Olaroz into production,” said Jon Evans, president and CEO. “With an additional $40 million in cash on our balance sheet and over $200 million in available capital to fund our share of Caucharí-Olaroz, Lithium Americas remains in a strong financial position as we advance both of our projects.”Our third hot pick from July 21 was Albemarle, which traded at $87.23. It’s now up to $97 and could easily challenge a recent high of $101 shortly.One of the company’s top segments is lithium, which offers lithium carbonate, lithium hydroxide, lithium chloride and value-added lithium specialties, as well as reagents, such as butyllithium and lithium aluminum hydride for applications in lithium batteries for consumer electronics and electric vehicles.In recent days, according to a recent news release, the company was selected by the U.S. Department of Energy as a critical partner for two lithium research projects. Albemarle will work with two Energy Department labs on the company’s approved projects. The first project, in collaboration with Argonne National Laboratory, is “Advanced Brine Processing to Enable U.S. Lithium Independence.”The second project, in partnership with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, is “Scaling Up of High-Performance Single Crystalline Ni-rich Cathode Materials with Advanced Lithium Salts.”On the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. Ian Cooper, an InvestorPlace.com contributor, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.

321,"Oct 7, 2020 2:13PM EDT","Another day -- another great day for investors in the renewable energy sector. In midday trading Wednesday, shares of hydrogen producers and fuel-cell manufacturers Plug Power (NASDAQ: PLUG) and Bloom Energy (NYSE: BE) are climbing 10.2% and 12.4%, respectively, as of 12:10 p.m. EDT. At the same time, shares of lithium miner Piedmont Lithium (NASDAQ: PLL) are enjoying a 6.7% gain.The question is: Why?Image source: Getty Images.There's no news out on the wires about any of these three alternative energy stocks. No upgrades, no price target hikes -- and certainly nothing of substance from the companies themselves that would explain share-price spikes of roughly 7%, 10%, and even 12%! And yet, the broad themes in renewable energy that are supporting these stocks remain in full effect. Let's quickly review.Plug Power and Bloom Energy, both of which got their start as pure-play ""fuel-cell stocks,"" are both segueing higher up the supply chain and developing hydrogen production businesses, as well, to produce the ""fuel"" that will go into their fuel cells (and perhaps other companies' fuel cells, too) going forward. In so doing, they're positioning themselves to profit from an international trend toward developing hydrogen economies -- in particular in Europe, where governments plan to invest ""hundreds of billions of euros in technologies enabling [Europe] to get a substantial share of its energy from hydrogen by 2050.""Whenever you hear about someone spending ""hundreds of billions of dollars"" on anything -- a stock price spike is sure to follow.Next up: Piedmont, which is benefiting from the other big trend in alternative energy today. Piedmont signed a five-year supply agreement to produce lithium for Tesla last month. And as if that weren't already good news, soon after this deal was announced, researchers in Europe put out a study predicting that by 2050, every vehicle on Earth will be electric and need lithium for its batteries -- and lithium supplies on Earth are only half what we thought they were.Both Plug, Bloom, and Piedmont are benefiting from significant macroeconomic tailwinds that are driving their stocks higher -- even today, when there's no particular news of note. To me, this looks like momentum investing, and for that reason, I have to warn you that it can be a dangerous kind of investing to rely on.Why? Let me direct your attention, once again, to the target date for when all these wonderful renewable energy trends will come to fruition: 2050. Not to belabor the obvious, but 2050 is a long way away, and a lot might happen to change these hydrogen and lithium stories over the next 30 years.Hydrogen vehicles could prove less cost effective than hoped. New lithium supplies could be found (perhaps in space?), driving down the cost of lithium. Or Lockheed Martin could finally perfect its small-fusion reactor, rendering both hydrogen and lithium moot.Or more simply, both the hydrogen and lithium ""stories"" could prove 100% accurate... but the companies that produce the hydrogen and the lithium still fail to make a profit, just as the fuel-cell companies have failed to do for decades already.I'm happy that investors in these companies are reaping windfall profits today. Just don't assume that today's stock gains will continue 30 years into the future -- because ultimately, companies need profits to sustain their stock prices, and for now, at least, profits are the one thing that all three of these companies lack.10 stocks we like better than Plug PowerWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

323,"Oct 7, 2020 2:01PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips2020 has shown the peril, and promise, of cyclical stocks.Coming into the year, many cyclical stocks looked cheap. But they probably should have looked cheap. Cyclical businesses are those that benefit most from the macroeconomic environment. The closer the economy is to a peak, the less sustainable a cyclical company’s earnings are. Investors should in theory pay less for those earnings, even if they don’t always do so in practice.2020 began amid the longest macroeconomic expansion in U.S. history. And so in sectors like residential construction, auto manufacturing and boating, to name just a few, cyclical stocks traded at low multiples at the start of the year. In many cases, investors could acquire those businesses for less than 10x earnings.Those who did learned the risks in a hurry. The novel coronavirus pandemic sent the market plunging in mid-February. Cyclical stocks were among the hardest-hit in the sell-off.Those who timed the bottom, however, reaped often-substantial rewards. Many cyclicals have tripled or better, with casino stocks in particular seeing massive gains.All told, an investor need only look at the last nine-plus months to understand that cyclical stocks can be volatile – and tricky. Risks are high. Valuation isn’t easy. But the rewards can be huge if the external environment cooperates.After the recovery from March lows, the upside for most cyclical stocks isn’t quite what it was. The risks, meanwhile, persist. But there are a few attractive names in the group. These four cyclical stocks look particularly attractive – and have near-term catalysts to boot:It’s worth emphasizing the risks in GM stock up front. Yes, the stock is cheap. But GM has been cheap pretty much since it returned to the public markets in 2010 after exiting bankruptcy. Over that nearly 10-year stretch, the stock has posted a return of -9.5% (though with dividends returns at least are positive).Meanwhile, auto manufacturing is as cyclical a business as there is. And with the likes of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) promising a revolutionary shift toward electric vehicles, it’s possible that GM’s revenue and earnings have hit a peak.That said, there’s an interesting play here at this point. It’s true that Tesla is a relatively new and significant competitor. We’ve seen several SPACs (special purpose acquisition companies) targeting the electric vehicle industry as well. Most have rallied nicely, though none have seen the massive rally in TSLA.GM, though, is working hard on EVs itself. It’s just not getting any credit for the efforts. Tesla’s Battery Day last month received significant attention. GM released its own batteries in March, which have twice the capacity of Tesla’s, but the news was drowned out by the pandemic.That may change at some point. And there’s a near-term catalyst as well. GM stock appears to have been pulled down of late by its association with Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA). GM announced a partnership with Nikola just days before a short-seller released a damning report on the electric truck startup.But as Wayne Duggan correctly pointed out on this site, GM’s deal with Nikola has basically zero risk. Investors seem to be figuring that out, as GM stock has rallied in recent days. If EV optimism adds to that recovery, the rally could and should continue.I recommended building products distributor GMS a couple of times before the pandemic. In the “new normal,” the case still holds with GMS back at a similar price.Residential homebuilders and construction suppliers generally have rallied in 2020. Investors are pricing in a pandemic-driven exodus from major cities back to the suburbs, which will drive years of demand. Yet GMS hasn’t quite benefited the way that rivals have.GMS has declined 6% so far this year. The iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (BATS:ITB) has gained 30%. GMS should have some catching up to do. And with the stock still trading at a single-digit multiple to earnings per share, valuation is far from an issue.As always, there are risks. GMS has exposure to both Canada and commercial construction, where the outlook isn’t as bullish. As with GM, GMS stock has been cheap for some time. It’s not likely to receive even a 15x earnings multiple unless those earnings fall dramatically.Still, there’s a path to upside. This is a well-run company with solid market share and tailwinds behind the U.S. residential business. At this valuation, that should be enough.Recreation stocks were among the cyclical stocks hit hardest in March. They’ve been among the biggest gainers since. Manufacturers of recreational vehicles and boats historically see sales plunge when the economy turns. But stuck-at-home consumers have turned to precisely those industries to find outlets with traditional modes of travel still a concern.Those tailwinds have benefited BRP, the maker of Sea-Doo, Ski-Doo, Can-Am, and other brands. As a result, DOOO stock has soared off its lows, gaining some 330%.But there seems room for another breakout. DOOO still trades below peaks reached in both February and early September. Based on guidance for this fiscal year, the stock trades at about 15x earnings. That’s hardly onerous, particularly with demand likely to stay elevated through at least 2021. It doesn’t seem too late to hop aboard DOOO stock.The epic financial engineering experiment that was DowDuPont hasn’t worked out. What were then Dow and DuPont merged in 2017 with the goal of then breaking up into three companies. Hedge fund managers loved the deal, which was supposed to both drive growth and reduce costs.But since the split happened last year, all three stocks have struggled. Corteva (NYSE:CTVA) has traded mostly flat, while both Dupont (NYSE:DD) and DOW stock have faded. (As an aside, it’s purely coincidence that this list includes GM and GMS plus DOOO and DOW.)The pandemic isn’t the sole cause, either. Energy industry weakness and other factors kept a lid on the stocks even before the February sell-off began.There’s a reasonable contrarian case at the lows, however. Dow still is one of the world’s leaders in chemical production. The stock looks expensive, at about 20x forward earnings. But, again, that’s how cyclical stocks should trade when end markets are depressed.That’s definitely the case at the moment. History suggests it will reverse. When it does, DOW might fulfill at least some of the hopes that greeted one of the largest mergers, and largest break-ups, of all time.On the date of publication, Vince Martin did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The post 4 Cyclical Stocks to Buy in October appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-cyclical-stocks-to-buy-in-october-2020-10-07

After an investigation, the employee was fired, according to the email. Tesla is currently still in litigation with another former employee of its Nevada Gigafactory, who was fired in 2018 after being accused of hacking the company's systems. Image source: Tesla.Prescott's email said in part, ""Two weeks ago, our IT and InfoSec teams determined than [sic] an employee had maliciously sabotaged a part of the Factory,"" and added that the damage was contained quickly, allowing the plant to be back running normally within a few hours.

327,"Oct 7, 2020 12:45PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOne thing is for certain: Kensington Capital (NYSE:KCAC) is going to be a fascinating company to watch over the next decade. Almost everything else about Kensington Capital stock, however, remains up for debate.Kensington Capital is planning to merge with QuantumScape, a developer of batteries for electric vehicles. It’s QuantumScape’s future that matters. As a SPAC (special purpose acquisition company), Kensington Capital is contributing cash (raised by the sale of KCAC stock) to help fund QuantumScape’s development. (Third-party investors are buying in as well.)And QuantumScape’s future could play out in a number of ways. There are reasons to believe that QuantumScape will become a force in EV batteries, and thus a key supplier to one of the world’s fastest-growing industries. In that event, what is now Kensington Capital stock and will, post-closing, likely be called QuantumScape stock would generate impressive returns.But there is no shortage of risks. Investors have bid up EV stocks this year amid a growing belief that adoption will accelerate in coming years. That forecast may prove too rosy. Even if it isn’t, QuantumScape itself doesn’t see material revenue coming in for years. In the interim, competition will be stiff, and more capital will be needed at some point. Any disappointments along the way could make raising that capital more difficult, and lead the stock downward before production has even begun.The bull case certainly is intriguing. In the most optimistic scenario, KCAC shareholders almost certainly will make multiples of their initial investment. But there’s a long path to get there, in terms of both time and risk. At the least, investors need to know what they’re getting into.What’s the world’s leading battery supplier worth? It’s a key question for KCAC stock — and it’s unanswerable at the moment.After all, countless factors go into an investor’s estimate of the answer. How fast does the EV industry grow? What market share counts as leading? How many competitors? What are the batteries priced at? What do they cost to make?It’s impossible to accurately answer those questions at the moment. But Kensington Capital and QuantumScape attempted to at least make a guess. In an investor presentation last month, the company modeled revenue, profits, and free cash flow out to 2028.Again, the figures are guesses. But QuantumScape and Kensington presumably have better tools to make educated guesses than most of us (even if, presumably, they’re far more likely to be too optimistic than too pessimistic.)In 2028, QuantumScape expects revenue of about $6.5 billion. EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) would come in at over $1.6 billion. Free cash flow would clear $500 million.What, exactly, those metrics mean for the Kensington Capital stock price too is uncertain. But the company notes that Nio (NYSE:NIO) trades at 6.5x revenue, and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) twice as high. The former multiple would value QuantumScape in 2028 at about $42 billion; the latter about $85 billion.50x free cash flow — not out of line for what would still be a growth company — gets to $28 billion. 30x EBITDA values QuantumScape at roughly $50 billion.There’s a huge range between those valuation estimates — none of which are definitive. There’s no specific reason why 50x free cash flow makes more sense than, say, 42x.And there’s a big difference between the three stories. An investor could argue that Kensington Capital stock would deserve a premium to the current multiples Tesla and Nio, given higher projected margins. She could also argue that it deserves a discount to TSLA in particular, given that Tesla has a far broader portfolio.But investors need to take the broad view. At the current Kensington Capital stock price, and accounting for the fact that the capital being raised will be spent in the next few years, QuantumScape is valued at less than $7 billion.In other words, if QuantumScape hits its targets, investors should reasonably expect 300% returns — at least.Of course, in this model those returns take eight years or so. Still, that’s an exceptional pay-off for that kind of patience.Obviously, the question is if QuantumScape will hit its targets. For a number of reasons, it’s far from guaranteed. The company expects to have over $1 billion in cash once the merger closes. But all of that cash will be spent, based on the company’s own projections, by the time production starts to ramp.That means QuantumScape will have to go back to the markets. The company at the moment plans to raise debt financing, with the help of supply agreements with automakers. It helps that one of those automakers will be Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY), a key QuantumScape shareholder.It should also help that the company’s technology simply may be better. The company is developing lithium-metal batteries, which promise improvements over current lithium-ion versions. QuantumScape promises better range, faster charging, and bigger power from its products versus existing alternatives — all at lower cost.They’re big promises. But QuantumScape has an impressive roster of backers beyond Volkwagen. Its board of directors includes renowned tech investor John Doerr and former Tesla chief technology officer JB Staubel. Clearly, they believe in the company, and their imprimatur suggests that investors should do the same.So what goes wrong? Possibly, anything — and then everything.QuantumScape’s technology is unproven. The company has been around for a decade and invested over $300 million in research and development so far. But production, by the company’s own estimate, still is more than five years away.Over that stretch, EV optimism needs to stay reasonably elevated. Given lower oil prices, adoption may not be quite as fast as bulls believe.Competition is going to be stiff. Tesla just held its Battery Day, and is promising its own improvements. There are dozens of startups working on their own designs. General Motors (NYSE:GM) announced its Ultium batteries in March.The worst-case scenario for Kensington Capital stock is that it eventually hits zero, if under a different name. Again, the company itself doesn’t expect to generate positive free cash flow for another eight years. If development hits a snag and/or a rival takes the lead, additional financing could dry up. Production issues wouldn’t be a surprise. A development effort of this size and length requires a lot to go right.So the case for KCAC stock isn’t that it’s likely to be worth $30 billion or more in eight years. It’s that, if all goes well (or mostly well), the company might be worth $30 billion or more in eight years — or 15 years.For EV bulls, that’s probably still a good enough bull case. It’s certainly enough to make Kensington Capital stock intriguing. But caution and position sizing are key here: it’s unwise to invest more in KCAC than an investor can afford to lose.On the date of publication, Vince Martin did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The post Rewards in Kensington Capital Stock Require Risk and Patience appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/rewards-in-kensington-capital-stock-require-risk-and-patience-2020-10-07

329,"Oct 7, 2020 10:59AM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSnowflake (NYSE:SNOW) is one of the hottest initial public offerings and that’s in no small part due to Warren Buffett.Indeed, one of the backers of SNOW is the Oracle of Omaha’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B). According to Business Insider, the conglomerate owns approximately 6.1 million Class A shares. What’s more remarkable, though, is that Buffett has consistently avoided high-flying, loss-making technology plays and IPOs, instead preferring more stable and reliable investments.That the legendary investor is changing his tune – and putting his money where his mouth is, so to speak – has given SNOW an extra sentiment boost. Further, as this recent IPO continues to trade during these uncertain times, Buffett’s vote of confidence may inspire additional purchases.As a comprehensive data analytics and warehousing specialist, I can see exactly why many are excited about Snowflake. During my career working with some of the biggest retailers in the world, I relied heavily on data science platforms.For instance, one of the observations my team made through analytics was the correlation between product packaging size and increased sales in the U.S. market. Though exterior packaging was of little concern abroad, at home, consumers equate larger size with importance. Thus, it made sense to request our packaging facility to design larger surface-area packages.While this observation could be made qualitatively, it wasn’t until my team used data science to quantify such trends and therefore justify making a strong business decision. Today, multiple businesses, especially retailers that are levered to seasonality and consumer behaviors, are simply dead in the water without data analytics.From this context, it’s easy to understand why investors are excited about the Snowflake IPO. At the same time, this enthusiasm hides a lingering concern about this market debut.As you know, we live in a world of data. This has presented incredible opportunities for those that know how to harness this wealth of information. But turning this data mine into actual wealth is what separates true data analytics firms from the pretenders.It’s here that Snowflake is incredibly prescient and frankly refreshing. According to its website, SNOW points out that “Your data scientists spend 80% of their time searching for and preparing data. Imagine their business impact without that burden.”Exactly. Say no more.In many ways, most of us perform data science. Technically, many of my InvestorPlace articles, including my comparison of Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) involves some of the principles of this discipline.Using the above example, I argued that the same sentiment that has driven TSLA shares to blistering heights this year applies to PLUG as well. Fundamentally, this makes sense as both companies make vehicles powered by alternative energy sources. But my justification for making this argument was the strong correlation coefficient between the two securities’ price action this year.Establishing that a mathematical correlation exists, I then noted that both companies’ price charts show different but nevertheless bullish formations. It’s data science that allowed me to quantify this observation, the same science underlining SNOW.And yes, Snowflake is correct – it takes a lot of effort digging up the data points. Imagine that in a much greater scale and you can see why SNOW has attracted so much attention.However, Snowflake is answering the “what” of this question – creating a platform to generate data inquiries quickly. But the “why” is where true innovation begins. In other words, data science is only as good as the question (input) you ask.To be fair, I’m not sure if any data analytics software is even close to being adequate enough to address the “why” conundrum. Unfortunately, this means that any software solution will be subject to commoditization until that groundbreaking innovation is forwarded, if ever.Now please don’t misread this as a takedown on SNOW. As a product, I believe Snowflake has done an excellent job. If I were back in consumer retail management, I would probably use its platform. However, people should separate the product acumen and the investment proposition of SNOW shares.For one thing, we’ve seen other hot data solutions companies languish following their IPO. For instance, Cloudera (NYSE:CLDR) got off to a brilliant start. Due to the company’s early adoption of network-distributed computing platforms that enabled enterprise clients to make practical use of massive volumes of unstructured data, CLDR was on fire.Later, however, Cloudera faced competition from cloud services providers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Additionally, Cloudera was entangled by its commitment to legacy platforms while simultaneously building its cloud-based solutions. With Snowflake, it has no such encumberment, operating exclusively in the cloud.Still, the bigger problem is that Cloudera was focusing on building a better “what.” Grammatically and conceptually, “whats” are commodities. On the other hand, “why” is the beginning of learning and intelligence.Like I said, we are not at the point where computers can ask the “why” for us. Instead, we must make do with quicker and more convenient “whats.” Right now, SNOW is the quickest “what” around. But that is not a stable ground to walk on.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

330,"Oct 7, 2020 8:23AM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSelling off from its September highs, is now the time to dive into DiamondPeak (NASDAQ:DPHC)? The SPAC (blank-check company) could head even higher, once it completes its merger with the privately held electric vehicle (EV) startup Lordstown Motors. But, with the “EV Bubble” slowing down, we may approaching the point in which said bubble starts to pop.Major EV names focused on the U.S. market, like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) and Electrameccanica (NASDAQ:SOLO), have trended lower as of late. Yet, one can argue the situation’s different here with this EV truck maker in the making.Why? Firstly, unlike some of the other development-stage EV names, the company is already showing signs its flagship vehicle, the Lordstown Endurance, will be a success. The company has received 40,000 pre-orders. That means nearly $2 billion in potential revenue.Secondly, this EV maker may be barking up the right tree by focusing on the commercial work truck market. With fuel costs a major pain point among this vehicle type’s target market, there’s a clear incentive to pivot towards electric-powered solutions.Thirdly, this company not only has demand, but the infrastructure to deliver. With its ownership of a former General Motors (NYSE:GM) facility, the company has more than enough capacity to live up to expectations.So, does this make the stock a buy at any price? Not exactly. With the risk of an EV bubble pop on the horizon, tread carefully before diving into this EV powerhouse in the making.As our own Matt McCall discussed Sep 10, there’s plenty of reason why this EV name can deliver on its high expectations. In a short amount of time, this company’s merger partner, Lordstown, has managed to get many things right.How so? With the aforementioned 40,000 pre-orders for the Endurance, it’s clear the demand is there for a commercial EV truck. With billions of potential revenue right out of the gate, it may be a shorter-than-expected road to profitability for Lordstown.Also, as I hinted at above, the switch to EVs may happen sooner with work trucks than with passenger vehicles. Given that fuel costs are a major pain point among end-users of work trucks, this alone could result in a faster move away from internal combustion engines.Finally, this company not only has big demand behind it, but the infrastructure to deliver. Lordstown gets its name from the shuttered Ohio auto plant the company acquired from General Motors. With this facility, the company has the capacity to produce 600,000 vehicles per year.But, while the company has so many factors in its favor, that doesn’t mean it’s worth entering a position at today’s prices Mr. Market is well aware of the tremendous opportunity with Lordstown. And that’s why DiamondPeak continues to trade at more than double where it was before the deal announcement.In short, even as the underlying business moves ahead, this “too hot to touch” stock could head lower. It all hinges how the “EV bubble” plays out over the next few months.With EV megatrends charging ahead, despite the novel coronavirus, this sector, which was already richly-priced, trades at an even greater growth premium. Valuation hasn’t been as big of a concern this year. But, that doesn’t mean it won’t be sometime down the road.Even after the recent declines in Tesla, Nikola and this stock, the sector remains “priced to perfection.” And then some.  Any sort of hiccup/headwinds for the industry could mean more declines across the board for the sector.Sure, an “EV crash” isn’t guaranteed. So far, interest in this sector has cooled, but the bubble has yet to burst. Yet, using past as prelude (Dotcom bubble, etc), the aftermath typically isn’t pretty for sectors in full-blown bubble mode.So, what’s the worst that can happen? This stock could head lower, even as its underlying business continues to take off. Does that mean the stock falls back to $10 per share? Probably not. But, there’s a good chance shares head lower from here, and take several years to retrace the recent high-water mark.If you missed out on this EV play at lower price, you’re probably kicking yourself. But, chasing it as it trades near all-time highs isn’t the solution.So, what’s the play here with DiamondPeak? If you are bullish on its long-term prospects, wait for additional pullbacks before buying. The story behind Lordstown isn’t changing anytime soon. But, there’s still plenty of time to get in early, at more reasonable prices.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not (either directly or indirectly) hold any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Thomas Niel, contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single stock analysis since 2016.The post Tread Carefully Chasing DiamondPeak Stock appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tread-carefully-chasing-diamondpeak-stock-2020-10-07

331,"Oct 7, 2020 8:11AM EDT","(RTTNews) - Tesla Inc. fired an employee for ""maliciously sabotaging"" part of a factory last month, Bloomberg reported citing an internal email. The electric car maker informed workers at its auto plant in Fremont, California that the employee was terminated after internal investigation.The operations at the facility were disrupted for only a short period as the company responded to the incident rapidly, the report noted.In the email, Al Prescott, Tesla's vice president of legal and acting general counsel, wrote, ""Two weeks ago, our IT and InfoSec teams determined than an employee had maliciously sabotaged a part of the Factory. Their quick actions prevented further damage and production was running smoothly again a few hours later.""As per the memo, the unnamed employee allegedly sought to cover up his tracks, blame a co-worker and destroy a company computer. However, the employee confessed after being shown the irrefutable evidence, and the company terminated the employment.Tesla manufactures the S, X, 3 and Y models at its auto plant in Fremont, which employees more than 10,000 people.Stating that the acts were crimes, violations of its code of conduct, and are unfair to other employees, Tesla said it will take aggressive action to defend the company and its people.Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk last month had confirmed that Tesla's factory in Nevada was the subject of a hacking attempt by a Russian national and his co-conspirators. Prosecutors in Nevada filed a complaint against Egor Igorevich Kriuchkov for allegedly conspiring to recruit an employee at the company, in order to surreptitiously install malware on its computers.

332,"Oct 7, 2020 8:10AM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGores Metropoulos (NASDAQ:GMHI) is a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), that has agreed to merge with Luminar, a company that is well-positioned  to revolutionize the auto industry. As a result, I recommend that longer-term investors buy GMHI stock. Luminar’s  LIDAR (light detection and ranging) technology looks poised to finally enable automakers to sell self-driving cars to the public. My belief is largely based on Volvo’s (OTC:VLVLY) decision to equip some of its vehicles with Luminar’s LIDAR starting in 2022.According to The Verge, very few automakers sell vehicles that are  equipped with LIDAR because the technology is “ridiculously expensive, with the leading suppliers pricing theirs at around $75,000.”But Luminar is selling its LiDAR for a significantly cheaper (though unspecified) price. As a result, Volvo will add the company’s system to a number of its cars starting in 2022, and those vehicles will be completely autonomous on highways.LiDAR will set Volvo apart from its competitors which do not plan to sell autonomous vehicles to the public. Instead, multiple other automakers intend to use autonomous vehicles as robotaxis that will transport consumers in exchange for per-trip fees.It appears that Luminar is the only LIDAR maker whose system is cheap  enough to sell to the general public. Given that huge advantage, I believe automakers will eventually seek to buy Luminar’s LIDAR, making GMHI stock a great name to own.Another InvestorPlace columnist, Matt McCall, recently identified one of the keys to Luminar’s success. Specifically, he reported that LiDAR was completely built in house, including the semiconductors.I believe that Luminar’s decision to cut out the middlemen enabled it to sell its LIDAR for much cheaper than its competitors.According to MIT’s Technology Review, “Luminar’s device uses longer-wavelength light than other sensors, allowing it to spot dark objects twice as far out.”Luminar’s competitors will likely need years to duplicate its parts-making operation. By the time they do so, Luminar will probably have a tremendous first-mover advantage when it comes to selling LIDAR to automakers.The deal with Volvo indicates that Luminar’s technology works well. Additionally, the Swedish automaker invested an undisclosed amount in the company in 2018. That suggests that Volvo was impressed by the company and its 25-year-oldf ounder and CEO, Austin Russell.Moreover, veteran billionaire investor Peter Thiel was a backer of Russell very early on, providing him with $100,000 to develop Luminar’s technology within the framework of the Thiel Fellowship program.Under the program, college dropouts are given $100,000 to develop new technologies. Thiel subsequently invested additional funds in Luminar, indicating that he’s confident in Luminar and Russell after having observed them in action for years.Russell, who will also control a majority of the company’s stock, is not the ideal age to lead a major, publicly-traded tech firm, b the investments by Volvo and Thiel indicate that Luminar and by extension Russell, know what they’re doing, Moreover, Mark Zuckerberg was in his 20s when Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) launched its IPO, and Facebook stock has done very well.Finally, Luminar may have supply and cost issues when demand for its LIDAR soars. But another revolutionary company, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), managed to overcome similar problems, and I’m confident that Luminar will be able to emulate Tesla in that area.Trading with a market capitalization of just $530 million, Gores Metropoulos looks like a proverbial steal, given Luminar’s huge potential.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. Larry has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 13 years.

333,"Oct 7, 2020 12:49AM EDT","Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock has soared by over 4x this year and Tesla’s market cap stands at about $400 billion, compared to about $50 billion for the BMW Group. Tesla also trades at a trailing P/S multiple that is almost 40x BMWs.  This comes despite the fact that BMW’s revenues are about 5x Tesla’s, and its deliveries are about 6x Tesla’s. Does this make sense? Not entirely, but there are a couple of factors that support a valuation premium for Tesla, including its significantly higher growth, expanding margins, and growing software sales. In this analysis, we compare Tesla’s financial and operating metrics with the automotive business of the BMW Group. We break-up our analysis into revenue metrics, margins, and cost metrics. See our complete analysis BMW And Tesla: A Detailed Comparison for more details. Parts of the analysis are summarized below.Tesla’s Deliveries A Fraction OF BMW, But Its Clearly Gaining Ground In the U.S. Tesla’s Total Deliveries Stood At 370K Units In 2019, Compared To About 2.5 Million Units For The BMW Group. Tesla’s deliveries have risen from about 32k units in 2014 to 368k units in 2019, a growth rate of over 60% per year, driven partly by the launch of the Model 3 in 2017. BMW, on the other hand, has seen its total deliveries (including Mini and Rolls Royce) grow from 2.1 million units to 2.5 million, a growth rate of under 4%. Tesla has considerable room to scale up, given that it still largely caters to the U.S. market with just 4 models in its lineup, including the Model Y that was launched earlier this year. In comparison, BMW has over 10 model lines, with multiple variants. Tesla already sells more Model 3 vehicles in the United States than all of BMW’s luxury sedans, so this could be an indicator of its potential as it scales up globally, with new factories. Moreover, Tesla also plans to offer increasingly affordable vehicles going forward.Tesla’s ASPs have declined from $95k in 2014 to $57k in 2019 and it’s likely that the number will fall further as the sales mix of Model 3 and Model Y rises. BMW’s ASPs have declined from $47k in 2014 to $43k in 2019. Tesla’s Automotive Revenues have grown from $3 billion in 2014 to $21  billion in 2019. In comparison, BMW’s revenues grew from $100 billion to $109 billion. How Do Tesla’s Cost & Margin Metrics Compare With BMWTesla’s Automotive Gross margins were roughly comparable with BMW’s Gross margins at about 21% in 2019. Note that we are adding back R&D expenses to BMW’s reported gross margins, as the company considers R&D a part of direct costs. Tesla is also making solid progress in reducing its operating expenses. Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses as % of revenues stood at 11% in 2019, down from 19% in 2014, as the company streamlined its retail operations. The metric for BMW has remained in the 8% to 9% range over the same period. On the R&D front, Tesla has significantly scaled back its expenses, with the metric falling from 15% in 2014 to 5% in 2019, bringing them roughly in line with BMW’s. As Tesla continues to double down on self-driving software sales, cuts battery costs, and builds a greater scale with new factories and models, it’s very likely that its margins will scale up further, eclipsing BMWs.While Tesla is certainly selling more cars and doing so more efficiently, this alone doesn’t justify its massive valuation premium over BMW. Investors are taking a long-term view with Tesla, betting that the company’s innovative tech and the vision of CEO Elon Musk could help it play a big role in the future of the transportation industry. The stock makes sense at current valuations only if you believe in  Tesla’s massive self-driving leadership and that growing software-as-a-service sales will translate into sizable profits down the road.What if you’re looking for a more balanced portfolio instead? Here’s a high-quality portfolio to beat the market, with over 100% return since 2016, versus 50% for the S&P 500. Comprised of companies with strong revenue growth, healthy profits, lots of cash, and low risk, it has outperformed the broader market year after year, consistently.See all Trefis Price Estimates and Download Trefis Data hereWhat’s behind Trefis?

334,"Oct 6, 2020 5:46PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNio (NYSE:NIO) has been absolutely on fire this year, with NIO stock surging nearly 400% higher on the back of abundant optimism that the company is finally turning into what it was hyped up to be from the start: the Tesla of China. This optimism is not misplaced. EVs are taking over the world, and NIO does project as the Tesla of China.To that end, while the rally in Nio’s stock has been jaw-dropping in 2020, this uptrend is here to stay. After all, NIO is still worth just $25 billion. Tesla, by comparison, is worth $400 billion.Over the next several years, China’s auto market will get electrified, NIO will dominate the premium segment of that market and sell a ton of luxury EVs at favorable margins, revenues and profits will surge higher, and NIO will soar toward $40 per share.On the bottom line, this means you should buy NIO today because its winning streak is far from over.I’ve said it before (many, many times) and I’ll say it again.Electric vehicles are the future of transportation.Demand is shifting, as young consumers — who are hyper-aware of the environment and want to “save the planet” — are shunning gas cars in favor of EVs, with a 2018 survey from HPI finding that 91% of millennials are considering buying an electric car for their next vehicle purchase.Importantly, these young consumers are only acquiring more and more purchasing power, and — by the 2030s — will be the largest driving force in the automobile market.A the same time, the technology is improving, because the aforementioned demand shift is attracting more and more resources and talent into the EV space — the sum of which is driving huge advancements in EV battery technology, so that these cars are driving farther, recharging faster and getting way, way cheaper (the median sales price of a new EV dropped 70% between 2010 and 2016).These technological improvements will only accelerate over the next several years alongside accelerating demand, and — by the 2030s — EVs will be able to drive for thousands of miles, will recharge in minutes and will cost far less than your average diesel car.Thus, by the 2030s, every prospective car buyer will want an EV, and those EVs will be deliver significant performance at affordable prices.It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to connect those dots.Between now and 2040, EVs will go from niche to ubiquitous. Alongside that exciting journey, pioneering EV makers — like NIO — will grow by leaps and bounds.NIO is an especially attractive play in the EV space because the EV opportunity in China — NIO’s home market — is huge.It’s no surprise that — with over 1.4 billion people — China is home to the world’s largest auto market. And it’s not even close. About 64 million new passenger cars were sold in 2019. Just under 21.5 million of them were sold in China. So, one out of every three new passenger cars sold in the world in 2019, was sold in China.Thanks to robust government support, China’s huge auto market is also home to the world’s most mature EV market. One out of every two EVs sold in the world in 2019, was sold in China.This robust government support isn’t going away anytime soon. China is targeting 25% EV sales penetration by 2025 — versus less than 5% penetration today. If that happens, it means China’s annual EV delivery volumes will reach over 5 million by 2025 — up 4+ million (or ~360%) from 2019 levels.In other words, the EV opportunity in China is both huge (because of China’s enormous auto market) and has high visibility (because of the Chinese government’s continued strong support of clean energy adoption).To that end, the biggest and best names in the EV megatrend — ex Tesla — may emerge out of China. In that group of Chinese EV makers, NIO is the best-in-breed when it comes to premium EVs — implying huge long-term upside potential for NIO stock.Make no mistake about it. NIO is absolutely killing the game in China’s premium EV market.The company has rattled off five consecutive months of triple-digit deliveries growth, including 104% year-over-year growth in August. And that’s with just two vehicles, the ES6 and ES8. The company just launched a third vehicle, the EC6, which should help spark even bigger growth in the last few months of the year.Importantly, NIO is doing this while China’s EV market isn’t booming. Thanks to the pandemic, China’s EV volumes are expected to drop 11% this year. NIO’s volumes will likely rise by more than 100%.So, this isn’t a “rising tide lifting all boats” dynamic. It’s a “speed boat leaving everyone else in the dust” dynamic.What’s NIO doing so right?They’ve cultivated strong brand equity and customer loyalty through Tesla-like marketing. They’ve cut out a high-demand and burgeoning niche in the premium market, and have proceeded to dominate that niche with superior performance vehicles. And they’ve continued to lean into a novel battery-swapping model which removes the cost of battery ownership from the driver, and therefore significantly reduces the prices of its EVs.All in all, NIO is absolutely killing the game in China’s premium EV market. So long as the company continues to do so, Nio’s stock will stay on a winning path.In the long run, my model suggests that there’s huge upside potential for NIO.My long-term model on NIO makes the following assumptions:Under those assumptions, I see NIO stock running to $40 by the end of the decade (using a 17X forward earnings multiple).Nio is a long-term winner that offers investors a high-visibility, big-potential way to play the EV megatrend. To that end, I wouldn’t give up on the stock just because it’s been on such a tear in 2020. Instead, I’d stick with the rally, and check back on the NIO price in a decade.Spoiler alert: it’ll be much higher than where it sits today.On the date of publication, Luke Lango did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The New Daily 10X Stock Report: 98.7% Accuracy – Gains Up to 466.78%.

335,"Oct 6, 2020 3:24PM EDT","By Noel RandewichOct 6 (Reuters) - Tesla's TSLA.O upcoming quarterly report could put another $3 billion in Chief Executive Elon Musk's pocket.The electric car maker on Tuesday saw the six-month average of its stock market value hit $250 billion, a milestone toward triggering the fourth of 12 tranches of options to buy Tesla stock at a discount, granted to the billionaire in his 2018 pay package.Musk's compensation is exclusively made up of a series of potential stock options rewards based on market capitalization and operational goals. To secure Musk's fourth tranche, Tesla still must hit a goal related to revenue or profitability, and that could happen in the company's third-quarter report, the date of which has yet to be announced.Tesla’s stock was down 0.8% at mid-day on Tuesday, but the company's six-month average market capitalization rose, thanks to a strong rally in recent months.Each tranche gives Musk the option to buy 8.44 million Tesla shares at $70 each, about a sixth of their current price.At Tesla’s current stock price of $420, Musk would theoretically be able to sell the shares related to the upcoming tranche, plus three other tranches that vested in recent months, for a combined profit of $11.8 billion, or almost $3 billion per tranche.Musk’s first tranche was worth about $700 million in May, when it vested, but its value has increased along with Tesla’s stock price.The Silicon Valley billionaire's pay package, which surpasses anything previously granted to top U.S. executives, was controversial when it was approved by shareholders. The median compensation for Tesla employees last year was about $58,000, according to a company filing.Tesla’s stock has surged 400% in 2020 as the company increased sales of its Model 3 sedan, giving it stock market value of almost $400 billion. After Tesla last week said it delivered a record 139,300 vehicles in the third quarter, investors are now awaiting the company's quarterly financial report. While investors focus on gross margins, free cash flow and earnings per share in that report, adjusted EBITDA will be key to Musk's personal finances. EBITDA, which stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, is a non-GAAP operating metric that Tesla further customizes by excluding the cost of stock-based compensation, including Musk's.In the four quarters through June, Tesla's adjusted EBITDA reached $4.42 billion, just short of a $4.5 billion milestone that would open the way for Musk's next options tranche.JPMorgan estimated in a recent client note that Tesla will report adjusted EBITDA of $1.183 billion for the September quarter, which would raise Tesla's rolling four quarters of adjusted EBITDA to $4.52 billion. That, along with Tuesday's increase in the company's six-month average market capitalization, would qualify Musk for his next options payout.Elon Musk's expanding payouthttps://tmsnrt.rs/30EelbG(Reporting by Noel Randewich, editing by Peter Henderson and Nick Zieminski)((noel.randewich@tr.com; (415) 677 2542; Reuters Messaging: Twitter: @randewich))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/teslas-quarterly-report-could-land-musk-another-%243-billion-2020-10-06

336,"Oct 6, 2020 2:53PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTech stocks suffered a massive selloff in September, leading to renewed interest in some of the biggest tech juggernauts, including, but not limited to, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Hard to believe that Jeff Bezos’ trillion-dollar conglomerate could be considered cheap. But the fact that AMZN stock is approximately 12% shy of its 52-week high will entice most investors. Considering the name involved here is Amazon.Plus, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently had respective stock splits. It’s not a given, but Amazon appears as the most likely candidate to move in that direction, next. Although not an elixir for stock prices, recent splits have led to steep gains in share prices for the companies involved. As a result, if the bulls are correct, this could be the shot in the arm AMZN stock needs. It also means that you should buy shares right now to take advantage of the possible uptick.Apart from the stock split, the usual positive beats in Amazon’s performance should keep you interested. Sales are up, and the company is now looking to roll out drone tech for deliveries extensively. That will reduce the headcount for Amazon prospectively and lead to a better bottom line.Any way you slice it, AMZN stock is looking pretty good right now.Stock splits are back in vogue this year, with Apple and Tesla leading the charge. Splits don’t have anything to do with fundamentals. However, they do end up attracting higher investor interest. Considering Amazon last did a stock split two decades ago, it seems pretty likely that it will go ahead and do one this year. After all, share prices need a bit of a lift after the tech sell-off.There are a couple of other factors in play here as well. Firstly, the stock split will help the company gain admittance to the prestigious Dow Jones Industrial Average – the world’s most famous stock market index. It does sound surprising that one of the world’s wealthiest companies is not on the Dow, but there you have it.The anomaly is because the 122-year-old index is price-weighted, the influence of each company on there is based on their per-share value. A company like Amazon will end up dominating the other members just by being, well, Amazon. That’s why unless there is a stock split, it doesn’t look like the tech giant will have its day in the sun on the Dow, a further incentive for the stock split.At this point, its no use talking up Amazon’s prowess in terms of financial metrics. Every quarter usually beats analyst expectations and is better than the one before it. The second quarter was no different, with net sales increasing by 40% to $88.9 billion from the year-ago figure of $63.4 billion. Meanwhile, free-cash-flow, a metric that Bezos values considerably, jumped by 27.6% year on year to finish at $31.85 billion for the quarter.Amazon Web Services or AWS, Amazon’s cloud computing service, keeps adding new customers, with HSBC (NYSE:HSBC) and Formula 1 Racing among the new entrants to its roster. The only point of concern that Amazon might have is Walmart (NYSE:WMT) recently launching its $98/year subscription “Plus” service. It will serve as a direct competitor to Amazon Prime, but time will tell if it’s able to make inroads into Amazon’s established markets.Back in August, Amazon got the go-ahead for its drone delivery system from federal regulators. That makes it the third significant entity after UPS (NYSE:UPS) and Google parent  Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) to get the nod. A potential game-changer, drone tech will be a significant contributor to the bottom line for Amazon in the foreseeable future.Drones, unlike humans, do not get sick, take leave or suffer from motivational issues. You could go ahead and use them around the clock without fail. Also, personnel costs contribute significantly to aggregate expenses for Amazon. Shipping and operating the fulfillment centers represented 30% of total operating costs last year. I am not saying that these costs will disappear overnight. But a gradual shift to drones will help in this area. Personnel, warehouse and delivery costs are a significant segment of the expenses for Amazon, one they would gladly want to reduce. Drones, an environmentally friendly option, will help greatly in this regard.You never waste column space when talking about AMZN stock. Whenever you broach the topic, there seems to be an infinite number of ways Amazon is revolutionizing how we do business. Whether it is the drone deliveries, AWS, Alexa, or its e-commerce platform, there is always something that the company is working on.That’s why it’s not surprising Amazon has become the preeminent company in the retail space. With such a strong supply line, it will continue to gobble up anyone that comes in front of it. Therefore, the recent pullback makes AMZN stock even more enticing to any retail investor out there.AMZN stock is a firm “buy”; snap it up before it makes up lost ground.On the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. Faizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

337,"Oct 6, 2020 2:19PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBy now, I’m sure at least some of you are getting quite tired hearing about special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs. Seemingly every other market debut is a SPAC, essentially a backdoor way of doing an initial public offering. Nevertheless, Gores Metropoulos (NASDAQ:GMHI) stock has attracted much attention and for good reason.By buying GMHI stock, you’re getting a stake in Luminar Technologies (once the transaction is complete), one of the startups in autonomous driving innovations.Specifically, Luminar Technologies specializes in an advanced system based off lidar, or light detection and ranging. Utilizing pulses of electromagnetic radiation, lidar signals “ping” off objects and calculates their distance based on the time it takes for the signal to return.Since the speed of light is a constant, lidar systems are incredibly accurate. Further, with proprietary adjustments, companies like Luminar can greatly enhance the range of object detection.To be clear, the case for GMHI stock isn’t so much the lidar system itself. Rather, it’s the innovations that Luminar has incorporated that makes its superior to other lidar-based platforms. Perhaps the most impressive is the company’s three-dimensional velocity detection system. Whether it’s a car changing lanes or a pedestrian that inadvertently crossed into an autonomous vehicle’s path, Luminar’s system can pick up and classify the object and make the necessary (or appropriate) avoidance measures.Another factor supporting GMHI stock is the underlying company’s stress testing. Most autonomous technologies today incorporate lidar due to its range and accuracy. However, traditional lidar systems have been stymied with inclement weather. For instance, a typical system could mistake falling snowflakes as a wall in the middle of the freeway. Obviously, that’s not something you want.However, Luminar’s goal is to achieve full autonomous driving at scale. Clearly, if a driverless vehicle couldn’t perform in various weather conditions, it would be rendered pointless. But the company has put its lidar system through the ringer with very encouraging results.Of course, nothing is without some disadvantages to consider. For GMHI stock, the underlying lidar technology has been cost-prohibitive. But even here, Luminar has managed to get its proprietary system down to a reasonable cost and with outstanding performance. At this point, you might be thinking that this is a unicorn company.That was my initial thought as well. However, when something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Don’t get me wrong – I don’t have anything against GMHI stock. Certainly, the science sounds incredibly compelling. But here’s something to chew on before you dive in – Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk is no fan of lidar.In last year’s edition of Autonomy Day, Musk stated:LiDAR is a fool’s errand…Anyone relying on LiDAR is doomed. Doomed! [They are] expensive sensors that are unnecessary. It’s like having a whole bunch of expensive appendices. Like, one appendix is bad, well now you have a whole bunch of them, it’s ridiculous, you’ll see.If you had any doubts about Musk’s conviction, he added that lidar is “lame.” It’s not just the expense issue, which Luminar has addressed. Rather, it’s that lidar relies on data interpretation. However, with a camera, you’re mimicking natural vision. Over time, it’s theoretically possible that camera sensors can read road signs, even those that are put up impromptu. By relaying this information, camera-based autonomous vehicles can possibly make better decisions than lidar-based vehicles.Also, another factor that supports cameras is that they are passive systems. In other words, a driverless vehicle can “see” other cars without interfering with the environment. Again, this mimics human functionality, unless you’re one of those mutants that can shoot laser beams out of your eyes.That’s not really a joke because that’s basically what happens with lidar, which is an active system. In order for this platform to detect objects, it must somehow “touch” them. Unfortunately, this means that the safety profile regarding the 1550nm wavelength that Luminar utilizes is not quite clear.This is a controversial issue because other experts state that 1550nm lasers are safer for the eyes than the more popular 905nm wavelength. Nevertheless, I’m not entirely clear on the safety implications, as well as potential interference resulting from lasers being shot all over the place should this technology go mainstream.Interestingly, both Luminar and Tesla claim to benefit from their respective autonomous systems because of mass data collection. Thanks to profound artificial intelligence technologies, machines can learn from the collection of real-world data, finetuning their capacity exponentially.While that’s great and all, here’s a fact that can trump both lidar and camera-based systems: the human brain will always be superior to the best AI or autonomous system ever developed.Consider for instance the massively sized supercomputer, which forms the basis of multiple advanced technologies. To get around the enormous space and energy requirements of supercomputers, IBM (NYSE:IBM) invented Blue Gene. This radically reduced the size and cost of these remarkable machines.Yet Blue Gene is not what you would call cheap to run in absolute terms. It still consumes substantial energy, enough so that it requires thousands of gallons of water to cool the system. Further, IBM’s supercomputer requires multiple stacks of processors that are as tall as an average-sized human male.The point is, if you want true autonomy, you must apply a brute-force method by incorporating more processing power, which increases size and energy requirements. And all that computing capacity can’t replace the instinct and on-the-spot decision-making capabilities of the human brain, which weighs on average about three pounds.Frankly, driving is much more than knowing the exact distance of an object 200 meters away. All drivers operate on a mixture of training, personal experiences and gut reactions. To replace these attributes via AI may be impossible – who knows? More realistically, I see autonomous technology being utilized as a driver assistance rather than a driver replacement.But in the meantime, buying shares of GMHI stock isn’t a bad way of speculating on the next big thing. In the immediate term, lidar has more practical capabilities. Just be careful that in the long run, improving camera sensors may give lidar-based systems serious competition.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

339,"Oct 6, 2020 1:44PM EDT","It's looking like Tuesday's stock market will be a confusing one for lithium battery investors, as stocks of all stripes move in differing directions despite little ""new"" news.In 12:10 p.m. EDT trading, for instance, we see shares of Chinese lithium battery manufacturer CBAK Energy Technology (NASDAQ: CBAT) giving up an early 20% gain to settle down up just 2.1%. Things don't get much clearer further up the supply chain, where Piedmont Lithium (NASDAQ: PLL) is up 22% and holding onto its gains, but Lithium Americas (NYSE: LAC) is losing 11.7%.Let's see if we can make some sense of this mess.Image source: Getty Images.We'll begin with CBAK Energy, a small-cap maker of batteries in China that's so under the radar that we haven't written about it here at The Motley Fool even once -- but that is getting some attention here in the wake of Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) ballyhooed Battery Day last month.Despite sporting a market capitalization just 1,470th that of Tesla, CBAK bills itself as a competitor to the electric cars-and-batteries pioneer. In a press release last week, CBAK argued that its dual ""tabless"" rechargeable lithium battery was superior to ""Tesla's cathode tabless design in its 4680 model,"" offering ""greatly improved"" performance. Â Just corporate trash talk, you say? Perhaps. But CBAK says its ""32140 large-sized cylindrical tabless battery has officially passed its technical and Pilot Plant tests,"" and the company is gearing up for ""mass product delivery in the first half of 2021."" For car companies that compete with Tesla, CBAK's offering of a bigger battery with ""5 times"" more energy capacity per sell and a ""20% reduction in cost per kilowatts"" could prove attractive.Next, moving up the supply chain just a bit, we come to start-up lithium miners Piedmont Lithium and Lithium Americas, which as I mentioned, are moving in opposite directions. Why might thisÂ be?Analyst reports of an impending crunch in lithium supply are certainly a factor. As Tesla continues to ramp up production, and other carmakers develop and market their own electric car alternatives, demand for both rechargeable batteries and the lithium to make them is sure to rise. Still, at present, neither Piedmont nor Lithium Americas is producing lithium metal at scale.Â The main difference: Piedmont has secured a supply agreement with Tesla, while Lithium Americas has not. Granted, even Piedmont's deal appears to be conditional upon the company being able to begin deliveries before July 2023, which is far from certain. Still, having that deal in hand gives Piedmont a significant leg up over the competition.This, in a nutshell, is why I think Piedmont stock is continuing to rise today, while Lithium Americas is starting to fall.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

340,"Oct 6, 2020 12:39PM EDT","Tuesday brought a pause to the stock market's recent advance, as investors tried to determine how to balance all the conflicting dynamics affecting the financial markets. Rising long-term interest rates signaled greater belief that the U.S. government would succeed in providing more economic support to Americans, but definitive agreements weren't forthcoming.Just before 11:30 a.m. EDT today, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) was higher by just 9 points to 28,157. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) had lost 7 points to 3,401, and the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) had fallen 68 points to 11,264.Even with the upward momentum in the broader market starting to wane, there are still pockets of strength. One remains technology, with Alteryx (NYSE: AYX) leading the charge higher Tuesday. Elsewhere, the mining space has perked up, especially with smaller companies like Piedmont Lithium (NASDAQ: PLL) seeking to provide valuable minerals for battery technology.Image source: Getty Images.Shares of Alteryx soared 26% on Tuesday morning. The data analytics provider made a major leadership announcement and provided some guidance on its future results.Alteryx announced that it expects revenue for the third quarter to be $126 million to $128 million. That would represent growth of 22% to 24% from year-earlier levels. More importantly, it was far above the initial guidance of $111 million to $115 million that Alteryx had issued previously.The company also said that it has brought on a new executive. Mark Anderson will take over as CEO from co-founder Dean Stoecker, who will stay on as chair of the Alteryx board of directors. Anderson has served on the board for a couple of years now, and Stoecker expressed his confidence in him as ""the ideal candidate to serve as Alteryx's next CEO.""The stock took a tumble earlier this year as investors called into question whether the data analytics company would be able to sustain its former pace of growth. Today's news suggests that those concerns were unjustified, and new leadership could bring new accomplishments for Alteryx.Elsewhere, Piedmont Lithium climbed 23%, adding to gains from earlier in the week. The lithium mining upstart has gotten a lot of notoriety from a recent supply contract, and forces in the battery materials industry are helping support the share price today.Piedmont was relatively unknown until Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) signed a five-year contract with the company to buy high-grade lithium ore from Piedmont's proposed North Carolina mining and refining project. At that point, the miner came onto investors' radar.Also helping is a recent executive order from the White House identifying other battery-making materials as essential minerals vital to U.S. interests. Although lithium wasn't included in the executive order's list, it stands to benefit from greater attention to other minerals used in battery production.The deal still involves plenty of uncertainty. Piedmont is far from beginning operations, and the agreement will require both parties to figure out more specifics about a start date between mid-2022 and mid-2023. If Piedmont can't get everything up and running by then, Tesla would have the right to undo the agreement -- and presumably all of the mining stock's gains would be for naught.10 stocks we like better than AlteryxWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

341,"Oct 6, 2020 12:29PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBack in early June, after the Nio (NYSE:NIO) share price had popped from $2 and change to $5.50, I predicted that Nio stock still had plenty of room to keep running. Somehow, I suspected that the company would remain in hyper-growth mode for a while longer.Amazingly, on Oct. 2, the Nio stock price closed at an eye-popping $21.18. While I projected some share-price growth, I won’t claim to have known in June that the stock would catapult above by early October.The available data certainly paints a picture of a fast-developing electric vehicle manufacturer. As a result, I wouldn’t recommend attempting to short-sell Nio stock. That would just be foolhardy as the share price could keep on moving higher based on market hype and enthusiasm.As for prospective long-side investors, there’s no going back now. We can’t turn back the clock and buy Nio stock at $5 or even $10. All we can do is assess whether the risk-versus-reward profile is favorable at this point. This, then, will require some technical analysis.Even though Nio stock shed 2.67% on Oct. 2, the share price still remained up a heart-pounding 427% on a year-to-date basis. This makes the share-price surge I wrote about in June seem quaint in comparison.With that, Nio stock didn’t only achieve its 52-week high in October. It reached its all-time high, far exceeding any price point in the stock’s history.That might be exciting for traders who prefer to focus on momentum. On the other hand, the melt-up in the Nio stock price may cause concern among contrarians and investors who prefer value over exuberance.And indeed, it’s difficult to find deep value in Nio stock at the moment. If you can believe it, the stock’s trailing 12-month earnings per share is -$44.10. That’s on a stock which trades at $21 and change. It’s probably not a good sign.On the other side of the coin is Nio’s recent performance, not as a stock but as a company. Viewing things from that angle, the argument turns decidedly bullish.The company’s improvement can best be expressed through Nio’s freshly released automobile delivery figures. In particular, for the month of September, Nio delivered 4,708 vehicles. That signifies a 133.2% increase on a year-over-year basis.Moreover, Nio delivered 12,206 vehicles during the third quarter of 2020. That represents a 154.3% year-over-year improvement. It’s also above the higher end of Nio’s guidance for the third quarter.The impressive growth in Nio’s vehicle deliveries was likely a factor in Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu’s decision to reiterate his “buy” rating on Nio stock. Along with that, Yu maintained his upbeat price target of $24.Even with the optimistic rating and price target on Nio stock, Yu seems to concede that the company continues to face stiff competition from its peers.“The main push back we received on our bullish view is NIO’s brand does not create the same level of excitement and loyalty in China that Tesla or the German luxury auto makers command,” commented Yu.He’s making an important point there. As noteworthy as Nio’s improvement has been, the company simply doesn’t have the scale, the capital or the name recognition of electric vehicle behemoth Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).Indeed, I would suspect that the Nio stock price has gotten ahead of itself because some shareholders are wagering that Nio will be the next Tesla. Yet, this might or might not happen.Nio is still a tiny company. Compared to the performance of some other automakers, 12,206 vehicle deliveries during a full quarter is small potatoes. Nonetheless, long-side traders have bid the share price up to the high heavens based on the assumption that Nio’s growth will continue on its current trajectory.As an automaker in hyper-growth mode, Nio might live up to traders’ expectations and continue to deliver more record-setting quarters.However, that assumption of success has, I believe, largely been priced into Nio stock already. I’m still rooting for the company to succeed, but value-focused investors should wait for the share price to come back down to earth before jumping into the trade.On the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.The post Now That Everybody Loves Nio, It’s Time to Start Taking Profits appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/now-that-everybody-loves-nio-its-time-to-start-taking-profits-2020-10-06

343,"Oct 6, 2020 9:38AM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInterested investors have undoubtedly heard of SPAC offerings. This investment vehicle has hit Wall Street and garnered big-time attention among investors. As a result, Spartan Energy Acquisition (NYSE:SPAQ) has also caught investors’ attention. Shares of Spartan Energy Acquisition erupted higher in June. Of course, that was around when shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Nio (NYSE:NIO), Workhorse (NASDAQ:WKHS) and Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) were ripping higher, too. I mean, Tesla garnered a market capitalization of $475 billion at one point in the run. Of course, there’s the consideration of how others have succeeded in going public via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). In the same electric vehicle (EV) space is Nikola and Workhorse, which both came public via a SPAC offering. While Nikola has had plenty of drama lately, its success in making it to the public markets is noteworthy. Then there are other successful plays like Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) and DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG), which both went public via SPAC offerings. So what exactly is Spartan Energy Acquisition?As Tezcan Gecgil wrote in August, “Spartan had initially agreed with Fisker, a relatively recent addition to the world of electric vehicle (EV) makers, on a reverse merger. The initial date was set for Aug. 14. However, that date has now been delayed to Feb. 14, 2021.”In short, what is Spartan Energy Acquisition? It is essentially Fisker. The EV space has been red-hot in 2020 with investors pouring resources into these names. Personally, I don’t get it. Short of Nio and Tesla, many of these businesses don’t even have revenues. It was absurd to me that Nikola had achieved a higher market cap than Ford (NYSE:F) at one point, without any sales. Heck, the company hasn’t even completed its production facility yet. How can it be worth more than a well-established automaker? As a result, there is both opportunity and risk with Spartan Energy Acquisition. On the one hand, there is the possibility that investors stick with the EV enthusiasm. Again, I don’t get it, but my opinion doesn’t matter. I love Tesla’s cars, but I do not think the company is worth $400 billion at this point. But that doesn’t mean investors won’t bid it up to a $500 billion valuation and take its peers higher, too. On the flip side, Spartan Energy Acquisition faces multiple risks. First, there has been a flood of SPAC offerings. It’s very possible the market gets “SPAC-ed out” and these names struggle in the future. It’s also possible that investors start paying attention to the fundamentals. Nikola and Workhorse have generous valuations despite lacking fundamentals. If that’s the case, newcomers to the space may struggle. At least Tesla is the global EV leader and at least Nio has momentum on its side. Finally, there’s the whole Nikola debacle. After being called a fraud, the company is under the microscope. The SEC is investigating it, the stock is getting hit, and despite the recent good news on a partnership with General Motors (NYSE:GM), GM is seemingly second-guessing the company it saddled up with. Will this cause traditional automakers to be leery of Spartan Energy Acquisition? It’s certainly possible. Early in this article, I referenced the “explosion” higher in the share price. Shares of Spartan Energy Acquisition almost doubled in just a couple of days in June. However, that rally soon fizzled out. In mid-September, shares again caught a whiff of momentum. However, Spartan Energy Acquisition wasn’t able to take out its June highs, securing a lower high in the process. Near the end of the month, the stock repeated the pattern, allowing a downtrend resistance line to form (purple line). At the same time, the 50-day moving average and uptrend support (blue line) continue to hold. The stock is sending mixed signals, but we can use levels to help guide us. On the upside, a close above $15 puts shares back above the 20-day moving average and downtrend resistance. That opens the door to a rally back toward $17.50 and the September high up at $18.24.On the downside, a close below the 50-day moving average and uptrend support puts the September low in play at $12.52. In fact, this was a double-bottom low, hit on Sept. 4 and Sept. 24. A close below this mark likely puts the 200-day moving average on the table. On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.The post What Is Spartan Energy Acquisition and Is It a Buy? appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-is-spartan-energy-acquisition-and-is-it-a-buy-2020-10-06

344,"Oct 6, 2020 9:29AM EDT","For years, electric-vehicle investing meant one company: Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). Sure, Nissan had the Leaf and there were a few hybrids riding around, but Elon Musk's game-changing start-up was the only major player in the space.That's changing. And fast.Here are three big developments you need to know about in the world of electric-vehicle stocks.Image source: Getty Images.It's true: We're on track to see nearly a dozen new electric-vehicle stocks make their market debuts in 2020.Blame fuel cell-powered truck maker Nikola (NASDAQ: NKLA) for starting the craze, after it went public through a highly publicized reverse merger with special purpose acquisition corporation (SPAC) VectorIQ in June. Since then, we've seen the same reverse merger trick used by Lidar specialist Velodyne Lidar, Inc. (NASDAQ: VLDR) and electric powertrain manufacturer Hyliion, with electric vehicle manufacturers Lordstown Motors, Fisker, and Canoo expected to follow suit before the end of the year. Chinese EV companies Li Auto and Xpeng also went public this year, through traditional U.S. IPOs.With so many electric vehicle stocks hitting the market, investors need to look at the industry in a new way. A bet on Tesla in 2014 was a bet that the EV industry as a whole was viable. Now, even if the industry as a whole is successful, it's a near-certainty that at least one of these start-ups is going to flop. And with so much still in flux, it's not at all clear which one it will be.When Tesla finally went public in 2010, it had already been manufacturing its flagship Roadster for two years. But many of the EV companies that are debuting this year have never built a production vehicle at all. At least, not yet.Nikola is a prime example. Although it has built prototypes of its Nikola One, Nikola Two, and Nikola Tre semi trucks, it's never actually taken one of its vehicle designs through the production process, and in fact, doesn't even have a production facility built yet. Lordstown Motors has a facility in the former General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio, but it isn't expected to begin production of its first vehicle, the Endurance electric pickup, until 2021. Canoo's first vehicle, an all-electric minivan, won't debut until 2022.It's risky to invest in a manufacturing company that's never, well, manufactured anything. Remember how even Tesla ran into snags trying to ramp up Model 3 production in 2019? And that was after it had already had more than a decade of successful car production under its belt. Don't underestimate the potential of manufacturing problems to derail these companies' timelines.We've come a long way from the 1990s, when the big carmakers fought tooth and nail against offering electric vehicles as part of their product lineup. Today, every major automaker around the globe has at least one electric vehicle model currently for sale or in development. Many of these vehicles will hit the market in 2021 or 2022, if not sooner.The battery-electric crossover SUV seems to be the most popular vehicle on offer, with Tesla's Models X and Y already available, to be joined by Ford's Mustang Mach E by the end of the year. Nissan's Ariya will debut in 2021, along with new crossover SUV offerings from Audi, BMW, Volkswagen, and others. Meanwhile, Subaru and Toyota are jointly developing a pair of electric SUVs.Industry heavyweights aren't just developing their own cars, they're investing in smaller companies as well. For example, GM not only manufactures the Chevy Bolt, but owns a stake in Lordstown Motors and is also slated to invest in Nikola. Volkswagen is backing soon-to-go-public battery maker QuantumScape and is negotiating with Fisker regarding use of its technology in Fisker's Ocean SUV.The surge in interest among legacy automakers, coupled with all of the new start-ups, is likely to have a profound impact on the industry as a whole.By 2022, the global electric vehicle market will look profoundly different than it did just five years earlier. There will be new companies, new models, new technology, and -- most importantly -- new levels of competition among players in the space.Electric vehicle stock enthusiasts should expect that not all of their picks will be winners in this new world of EVs, and invest accordingly.10 stocks we like better than Nikola Corporation

346,"Oct 6, 2020 8:05AM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe last time I wrote about Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) was in late August. At the time, I argued that SPCE stock was worth buying for the long haul despite the dilution of a $460-million secondary offering.Up 18.8% from Aug. 25 through Oct. 2, the stock got most of its push from two analyst upgrades, InvestorPlace’s William White wrote on Sep. 28.“The first buy rating for Virgin Galactic stock comes from Bank of America analyst Ron Epstein. He says that no other company that the firm covers has ‘anywhere near comparable growth potential,’ to SPCE stock,” White said.The second buy rating — Susquehanna analyst Charles Minervino recently initiated coverage of Virgin Galactic at a “buy” — is based on the analysts’ belief that demand for space travel will be out-of-this-world hot.It’s hard to argue with either observation.That’s why in my last article about SPCE, I called it a long-term buy. Sometimes, the best investments defy traditional valuation standards. Virgin Galactic is one of those times.MarketWatch says there are seven analysts currently covering SPCE, including Epstein and Minervino. All seven analysts have a buy rating on its stock with an average target price of $25.43.Three months ago, only three analysts were covering the space tourism company. This time next year, I could see the analyst coverage double from where it is today.According to the mean analyst estimate, Virgin Galactic will lose $1.21 a share in fiscal 2020 and 69 cents in fiscal 2021. In the upcoming third quarter, analysts expect Virgin Galactic to lose 27 cents per share. Those really aren’t horrific numbers for a company that’s looking to send people into space.Recently, InvestorPlace’s David Moadel discussed Virgin Galactic’s countdown to profits. He believes that the total addressable market of 2.4 million high-net-worth individuals makes SPCE an excellent long-term pure-play buy. I couldn’t agree more.He also points out some other analysts who are on board the Virgin Galactic moonshot. Across the board, analysts have bought into Richard Branson’s vision for commercial space travel. Only something unforeseen is likely to drive SPCE off course.Currently trading above $20, my InvestorPlace colleague, Ian Cooper, stated in mid-September that the company’s stock could shoot into orbit on or around Oct. 22, the date of Virgin Galactic’s next test flight.“If Oct. 2020 test flights are successful, Virgin Galactic has said it plans to start flying by the first quarter of 2021. That could potentially fuel a multi-year boom for the Virgin Galactic stock,” Cooper wrote on Sep. 15.As Cooper suggests, the market for hypersonic flights to different parts of the world could be an even bigger piece of business for Virgin Galactic than commercial space flights.Together, the dual revenue streams make it difficult not to get excited about the company’s future.In March, I wondered if Virgin Galactic was the next Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).“As someone who’s always respected Virgin Group founder Richard Branson, the fact that Virgin owns 58.7% of Virgin Galactic suggests to me that if it’s not successful commercializing space flight, it won’t be from a lack of trying,” I wrote on March 11.“Yes, SPCE stock is speculative at this point in its history. However, since it’s down 56% in less than a month, buying shares now is much easier to justify.”It’s up more than 27% since then.However, Branson’s stake through his Virgin Group holding company has dropped from over 50% in May to 29.7% at the end of July to raise cash for some of the other companies affected by the novel coronavirus such as Virgin Atlantic.Make no mistake. The billionaire’s still very much a part of Virgin Galactic. As long as he is, I think you’ll see more analysts jump on board in the coming months.It’s just another reason I believe SPCE stock is one of the best speculative buys listed on a U.S. stock exchange.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. Will Ashworth has written about investments full-time since 2008.

347,"Oct 6, 2020 7:34AM EDT","Yesterday, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) announced it will make a $25,000 electric vehicle sometime in the near future, and it had me feeling some deja vu from the last decade following the solar industry. Ten years ago, I was extremely high on solar energy because costs were coming down, technology was getting better, and it only made sense that adoption would increase rapidly as solar power plants became more cost-competitive with fossil fuel power plants, and solar stocks would soar as a result.Most of the thesis was spot on. Solar energy production has exploded, solar panel efficiency is better than ever, and costs are now lower than fossil fuels in most locations. The problem? Very few solar stocks made any money. That experience has me nervous about Tesla stock's future, now that it's moving even further downmarket. And the risk translates to pure EV companies like Nikola (NASDAQ: NKLA), NIO (NYSE: NIO), and Workhorse (NASDAQ: WKHS), who are far less developed than Tesla is today.Image source: Tesla.Over the last few years, Tesla has gone from manufacturing vehicles that regularly sell for over $100,000 to promising to sell vehicles for $25,000. If we take those numbers as an example, Tesla would need to sell four times as many vehicles to generate the same revenue.But on the profit side, the picture typically gets worse as prices come down. If a $100,000 vehicle generates a 25% gross margin, as Tesla once aimed for, and a $25,000 vehicle generates a 15% gross margin, for example, you would have to sell 6.7 times more vehicles to make the same gross margin. And that trend is not only possible, but it's also likely for Tesla, and we saw it happen in the solar industry.Let's take First Solar (NASDAQ: FSLR) as an example. The company produced 1.4 gigawatts (GW) of solar panels in 2010 and increased that to 5.7 GW in 2019. But what did profits and margins do?FSLR Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsAs you may have guessed, both gross margin and net income were down over the past decade at First Solar. Costs were lower and production increased, but the increase in volume couldn't overcome the drop in margins, and profits have actually dropped as First Solar has grown.We can see margins trend lower in the auto industry as sale prices get lower as well. Take Ferrari (NYSE: RACE) compared to Ford (NYSE: F) and General Motors (NYSE: GM) as an example. In 2019, Ford sold 5.4 million vehicles worldwide and GM sold 7.7 million vehicles. On a scale basis they crush the 10,131 vehicles Ferrari sold, but right now Ferrari is more profitable than Ford over the last 12 months, and not far behind GM because its gross margin is nearly 50%, compared to single digits for Ford and GM. Long term, earnings are volatile, but it would be easy to argue that Ferrari is the auto stock that's generating the most shareholder value long term.RACE Net Income (TTM) data by YChartsNow, let's tie what we learn from the solar industry over the last decade with what we see in the auto industry. As Tesla grows production, moves downmarket, and reduces average sale prices, we would expect revenue growth to stall despite production increasing. And gross margins should come down as Tesla competes with lower-cost vehicles.The first already seems to be happening for Tesla. You can see below that revenue growth has stalled, despite production growing, in large part due to sales shifting from the higher-cost Model S/X to the lower-cost Model 3/Y.TSLA Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsThe decline in margins will take longer but you can see above that gross margin continues to be below the 25% benchmark that Elon Musk set for Tesla and is trending lower. And remember that electric vehicle (EV) competitors have been slow to ramp production, which could bring further pricing pressure, unless Tesla's brand allows it to command a premium for its EVs. Based on new product announcements, investors should expect competition to really heat up in the EV market in the next two to three years, which ironically coincides with Tesla going even further downmarket with a $25,000 vehicle.To be clear, I'm not arguing that Tesla is wrong in moving downmarket or increasing production. But I think it's worth understanding that profitability will not necessarily increase with production if the company's sales mix changes. Solar companies tried to grow volume enough to offset margin losses but couldn't in most cases. Tesla is trying to do the same in a business where companies who make lower-cost vehicles traditionally have trouble making consistent long-term profits. If we see margin pressure in the EV industry that looks anything like what we saw it in the solar industry, then Tesla may vastly underperform what investors appear to be predicting based on a $400 billion market cap. Understanding this history is important because investors who are bullish on EV growth can learn a lot from what happened to company finances as solar manufacturers lived through the growth phase of the industry. Despite the growth in solar deployment, solar stocks have struggled. You can see below that the biggest names in the industry today are lagging behind the market by a wide margin, and First Solar and SunPower (NASDAQ: SPWR) have lost investors' money since the start of 2010. Only Canadian Solar (NASDAQ: CSIQ) has squeaked out a gain, and it's a modest one at that. And these are the companies that survived. Massive manufacturers like Yingli Green Energy, Suntech Power, and SolarWorld filed for bankruptcy even as the industry grew.FSLR data by YChartsThe simple reason stocks haven't done well is because increased solar manufacturing and deployments haven't led to an increase in earnings, as you can see below.FSLR Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsThe reason solar stocks didn't do well over the past decade isn't that solar wasn't successful in disrupting fossil fuels, or because the amount of solar deployed each year didn't grow like crazy. It did and that was part of the problem. Costs had to come down to grow the market, and as the cost of solar panels came down so did margins. Manufacturers then had to compete more on price than technological differentiation. Margins came down eventually, earnings dropped, and stocks fell. For companies that layered on too much debt to expand, the only remedy was bankruptcy.EV manufacturing isn't exactly the same as solar, but there are lessons we can learn. I think it's clear that margins will come down as EVs become more affordable and Tesla, Ford, GM, and many others increase production. That'll force more price competition, which is ultimately why major automakers don't make much money on low-price vehicles today. These trends could lead to a sharp increase in EVs on the roads, but a big reduction in profits from each vehicle sold.With a market cap that's hovering around $400 billion, investors are eventually expecting Tesla to demonstrate it can make a consistent profit. But moving downmarket might not be the way to do it, and the solar industry provides some cautionary tales for investors.10 stocks we like better than Tesla

349,"Oct 5, 2020 11:34PM EDT","HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Corporate carve-ups generally provide a spark. LG Chemâs decision to spin off its batteries business has not electrified investors so far, however. Although some hesitation is warranted, the divisionâs true value is lost inside a $40 billion chemicals producer.   The South Korean conglomerate picked a good time for a split. Enthusiasm for electric vehicles is growing, powering manufacturersâ stock prices. LG Chem lays claim to the biggest worldwide market share for their batteries, supplying Tesla, General Motors and others. And yet rivals seem to attract higher valuations.  LG Chem shares have been on a tear, more than doubling since the start of the year. Some of that is attributable to what is now provisionally dubbed LG Energy Solutions, which also will house energy storage and small batteries. LG Chem projects sales for the group will more than double by 2024, to some 30 trillion won ($25.7 billion).    For now, the bigger top line belongs to plastics. Using Nomuraâs divisional estimates for 2021 EBITDA and multiples of comparable companies chosen by Breakingviews, the big petrochemicals division, along with smaller units that make products used in smartphones and develop drugs are worth almost $17 billion combined. LG Chemâs roughly $46 billion enterprise value therefore implies batteries are pegged at more than $29 billion.  On a standalone basis, things might look different. Blended estimates from Nomura and Mirae Asset Daewoo suggests LG Chemâs batteries will generate nearly $2 billion of EBITDA in the coming year. Valuations for CATL, Chinaâs BYD and Samsung SDI average out at about 23 times. On that multiple, LG Energy Solutions would be worth north of $46 billion, 56% more than what is imputed today.    There are understandable explanations for the muted market reaction to LG Chemâs mid-September separation announcement. For one thing, there will be some dilution if the parentâs ownership stake in batteries drops to 70-80%. Some shareholders also might dump LG Chem in favour of LG Energy. Moreover, an initial public offering is probably at least a year away. And Tesla's recently divulged battery plans could squeeze suppliers.  Even with all that factored in, though, itâs reasonable to expect a spark for LG Chem.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/breakingviews-lg-chem-will-get-a-charge-from-battery-spinoff-2020-10-06

350,"Oct 5, 2020 7:07PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCan Workhorse Group (NASDAQ:WKHS) stock muscle into the broader electric vehicle market? Currently, the Cincinnati, Ohio-based company is a niche player in the fast growing electric vehicle sector, focusing on electric powered delivery and utility vehicles. It’s a strategy that has, to date, paid off for the company and its shareholders.Workhorse stock has risen more than 700% this year, a staggering amount by any metric. The share price has rocketed to a high of $30.99 in September from $1.47. While the stock has since given up some of those gains, it is currently trading at around $25 a share.Much of the growth has come from the tremendous run up of stocks that are part of the broader electric vehicle sector, led by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), leaving investors wondering if Workhorse Group can broaden beyond its niche focus on commercial vehicles and maintain its torrid pace?Workhorse Group is a small company that’s competing for some big contracts. Most impressive, the company is currently on the shortlist for a U.S. Postal Service contract to purchase 180,000 new trucks to upgrade its national delivery fleet. Workhorse is on a shortlist of just three companies to win the lucrative Postal Service contract, estimated to be worth $6.3 billion. The other two companies on the list are Morgan Olson and an alliance between Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F) and Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK).While Workhorse Group is viewed as the underdog in the U.S. Postal Service contract lottery, the fact that the company is on the shortlist should be viewed as a vote of confidence (the original list of bidders totaled 15 companies). Many analysts feel that Workhorse Group is one big contract win away from outperforming electric vehicle leaders such as Tesla.The City of Orlando, Florida is also reported to be considering purchasing Workhorse Group’s electric utility trucks. Workhorse is in talks with General Motors (NYSE:GM) to takeover the Lordstown Assembly plant, a 6.2 million square foot manufacturing plant located in Lordstown, Ohio that Workhorse currently has a 10% stake in.While Workhorse Group’s delivery and utility vehicles are attracting attention, the company has yet to land any major contracts and remains unprofitable. Much of the lift in Workhorse stock is due to the fact that investors are snapping up shares of any and all electric vehicle companies, regardless of where they are at in terms of manufacturing and delivering automobiles.In addition to Workhorse Group and Tesla, other electric vehicle stocks that have had big runs this year include Nio (NYSE:NIO) and Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA).While a rising tide seems to be lifting all boats, it’s worth noting that Workhorse Group has been around since 1998 and became a publicly traded company in 2010. It’s not a flash in the pan. However, its niche focus on commercial electric vehicles may limit its potential market at a time when it is facing growing competition.The electric vehicle market has been growing exponentially in recent years and there are expected to be more than 250 million electric vehicles driven around the world by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). By some estimates, there are expected to be more than 100 different electric vehicle models available for sale in the U.S. by 2024 as major automotive manufactures such as GM, Volkswagen (ETR: VOW3) and Nissan (OTCMKTS:NSANY) ramp up plans to produce both commercial and consumer electric vehicles. The competition Workhorse Group faces is only going to become more fierce in coming years.In its most recent quarterly results ended June 30, Workhorse Group reported revenue of just $92,000 and operating expenses of $5.57 million. The company’s net loss was $131 million, mostly due to increased interest expenses of $124.3 million. These are not encouraging results and show clearly that Workhorse remains in start-up mode. There has been some speculation that the company might be targeted for a takeover by a larger, more established automaker.Given its lack of viable contracts and production as well as its poor financial results, investors would be best advised to steer clear of Workhorse stock for the time being. There are too many other more established electric vehicle makers and automotive companies available for investors to risk their hard earned money on.If the company wins the U.S. Postal Service contract or things change for the company in another fundamental way, then by all means consider buying shares. Until then, steer clear of Workhorse Group.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held shares of TSLA.The post Workhorse Group Stock Needs to Recharge appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/workhorse-group-stock-needs-to-recharge-2020-10-05

351,"Oct 5, 2020 6:11PM EDT","By Ben KlaymanDETROIT, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Electric vehicle startup Faraday Future aims to close a deal soon to go public through a reverse merger with a special-purchase acquisition company (SPAC), its chief executive said on Monday.""We are working on such a deal ... and will be able to announce something hopefully quite soon,"" Carsten Breitfeld said of the possibility of a SPAC deal.Breitfeld declined to say who Faraday is negotiating with or when a deal would close.A SPAC is a shell company that raises money through an initial public offering to buy an operating entity, typically within two years.SPACs have emerged as a quick route to the stock market for companies, particularly auto technology startups, and have proven popular with investors seeking to echo Tesla Inc's TSLA.O high stock valuation.Breitfeld, who joined the Los Angeles-based company as CEO last year, also said the company would deliver its first electric luxury SUV, the FF 91, nine months after securing funding, with volume production beginning 12 months after such a deal.Faraday has said it wants to raise $800 million to $850 million to launch the FF 91.It will initially build the vehicle at its plant in Hanford, California, but ultimately will use a contract manufacturer in Asia with which Breitfeld said Faraday has signed an agreement. He declined to identify the company.Once one of the more hyped EV startups, Faraday burned through $2 billion in cash and its founder Jia Yueting finalized his personal bankruptcy filing in June.Breitfeld said Jia no longer owns stock in Faraday, which is more than half owned by employees through an executive partnership and an employee stock ownership plan. Jia's stake had been a ""major blocking point"" to bringing in other investors, he said.Breitfeld acknowledged Faraday has struggled in the past with executing its business plan.""Because of the history and sometimes the bad news of the company, not everyone is really trusting us,"" he said. ""They want to see that we've become a stable company.""Breitfeld, a former BMW BMWG.DEexecutive, also co-founded Chinese EV startup Byton. Breitfeld left Byton in early 2019 and that company suspended production in July to reorganize.

352,"Oct 5, 2020 2:43PM EDT","Lithium mining stocks exploded higher in Monday trading. As of noon EDT, shares of Lithium Americas (NYSE: LAC) are up 9.9%, LiventÂ (NYSE: LTHM) stock has gained 13.5%, and Piedmont Lithium (NASDAQ: PLL) is doing best of all -- up a staggering 19.3%.But there's only a really good reason for one of these stocks to be rising, and it's not Piedmont.Image source: Getty Images.Over the weekend, Barron's ran an article discussing the rising demand for lithium to manufacture electric car batteries. The publication used last week's supply deal between Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Piedmont Lithium as its kickoff point, explaining that a lack of lithium is the ""only one thing standing between TeslaÂ andÂ world domination."" Â You might think this would logically lead to Barron's endorsing Piedmont Lithium stock, seeing as it is the company that just signed the deal with the electric vehicle (EV) maker. But Piedmont had already gained plenty already -- shooting up 236% on the day of the pact's announcement. Instead of chasing that stock higher, Barron's turned its attention to other miners such as Albemarle, Sociedad QuÃ­mica y Minera de Chile and Livent, encouraging investors to look into these more established lithium suppliers instead.Of these three stocks, by the way, Barron's concluded that ""Livent looks like the best bet""Â -- and certainly not Lithium Americas or Piedmont, neither of which is yet producing lithium at commercial scale.Barron's noted that global lithium production yields ""roughly 400,000 tons of lithium a year"" right now, theoretically ""enough to power 2 million to 3 million electric vehicles"" (but in fact, only a third of this production is available for EVs, because laptops, cellphones, and other rechargeable devices need lithium, too). In order to reach Elon Musk's goal of producing 30 million Teslas by the end of this decade, warns the magazine, lithium production ""will have to increase perhaps as much as tenfold.""Pricing remains a risk. The publication notes that, after peaking around $25,000 a ton in 2018, lithium prices have fallen to around $7,000 a ton over the past year. But even at that rate, so much demand creates an opportunity for new players -- so once they're up and running, start-ups Piedmont and Lithium Americas could still become players in this industry. In the meantime, however, Barron's urges investors to focus their research on businesses that are already operational and profitable.I think that's sound advice -- for lithium stocks, and for any stocks at all.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

353,"Oct 5, 2020 2:00PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhether you are a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock bull or bear, it is the most fascinating stock of 2020. Tesla stock detached from the company’s fundamentals long ago. However, it’s important for traders to monitor the latest fundamental headlines, nonetheless.On Friday, Tesla reported record third-quarter vehicle deliveries. For a normal auto stock, record deliveries would be an excellent reason to buy the stock. But Tesla shares initially traded lower by more than 4% on the news.Here’s a look at what investors need to know.The first thing I always recommend investors do when analyzing Tesla stock is forget about the share price. Forget about Eon Musk’s latest tweets. Forget about how you feel about global warming. Just look at the numbers.Tesla delivered 139,300 vehicles in the third quarter, a record for the company. That number also exceeded analyst expectations of 137,000 vehicles, according to FactSet. Beating expectations is always good news. Third-quarter deliveries were up 53.6% compared to the second quarter.Year-to-date, Tesla has delivered 318,350 vehicles, up 24.7% from the first three quarters of 2019. Those numbers represent a solid growth rate for Tesla.The company has previously said it will “comfortably exceed” 500,000 deliveries in 2020. So, Tesla will now need to report another record of 181,650 deliveries in the fourth quarter to meet its guidance.For investors who own any other auto or tech stocks, the analysis above is a typical assessment of a major financial disclosure. However, Tesla stock is the exception to pretty much every rule of investing. It appears extremely unlikely Tesla will hit 500,000 deliveries for the year. But Tesla rarely hits any of its financial targets, so investors may have already assumed a full-year delivery miss long ago.At the same time, Tesla stock showed huge gains this year. The company is literally worth nearly nine times as much as it was worth a year ago. Of course, Tesla didn’t deliver anywhere close to nine times as many vehicles in the third quarter as analysts were expecting this time last year.Tesla investors cheered the company’s $2.18 in adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter. But the stock has been repeatedly snubbed for inclusion in the S&P 500 index, potentially due to its heavy (and fleeting) reliance on regulatory credit sales.Revenue was down 4.9% in the second quarter. Free cash flow was down 32%.I recently wrote about how Tesla stock is extremely overvalued compared to both auto stock and high-growth tech stock peers.There are plenty of Tesla stock bulls out there that simply want to dismiss any talk of valuation. They argue that the company’s fundamentals will eventually line up with its market cap. But I have said just how much Tesla is overvalued today and just how long it takes to grow into that valuation will eventually matter.It took Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) more than 15 years to make it back to its dot-com bubble peak. Most investors know how much of a great growth company Microsoft is. I believe Tesla could potentially be lining up for its own 15 or 20 years of underperformance once the 2020 electric vehicle market mania starts to finally die down.Tesla reported some impressive delivery numbers in the third quarter. If the stock weren’t already up nearly 800% in the past year, I’d say it would make a great growth investment.“Tesla has a chance to be the dominant electric vehicle firm and is a leading autonomous vehicle player as well as a vertically integrated sustainable energy company with energy generation and storage products, but we do not see it having mass-market volume this decade,” Morningstar analyst David Whiston says.I agree with Whiston’s belief that Tesla could potentially dominate the global EV market in the long-term. Yet Whiston’s fair value estimate for Tesla stock is just $195, or about 54% below its current level. That target seems fair as well considering Tesla’s absurd valuation.I have repeatedly said Tesla is a great company with a laughable $400 billion valuation. It’s too dangerous to short because of its large short interest and the mania surrounding the 2020 EV bubble. But it is also too dangerous to buy given it is extremely overvalued, even compared to higher-growth tech stocks.Investors should do themselves a favor and stay on the sidelines when it comes to Tesla stock.On the date of publication, Wayne Duggan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.Wayne Duggan has been a U.S. News & World Report Investing contributor since 2016 and is a staff writer at Benzinga, where he has written more than 7,000 articles.

354,"Oct 5, 2020 1:36PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNio (NYSE:NIO) has raced into pole position ahead of the market. With bullish company news, solid price action and a broader market correction in the rearview mirror, Nio investors should be ready to ride a favorable risk-adjusted trend to big-time profits. Let me explain.Bearish seasonality lived up to its reputation in September. The leading tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to dive 13%. Fear was the co-pilot to this u-turn, as the VIX exploded to a historically extreme reading of 38% at its worst. It’s the type of environment that takes down the best of them. And it did too.Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Costco (NASDAQ:COST). Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Market influencers and growth companies alike were hit and most often, endured even larger selloffs. Of course, that’s not surprising. Chinese luxury EV outfit Nio didn’t prove immune to the broad-based pressure either.At their weakest in September, shares of Nio plunged 25%. That’s nearly double the Nasdaq’s correction. Still, given NIO’s growth prospects, “smaller” valuation, foreign domicile and highly volatile industry, the much larger drop in shareholder value is typical of this type of investment. The only surprising item of notice might be that rival Tesla shed an even larger 34% at its low last month.Interestingly, both EV manufacturers bottomed together and weeks ahead of the broader market, which only found its technical footing the past several sessions. What’s more, conditions have only gotten better for Nio.NIO’s early leadership continued to pick up steam in September, while also managing to outperform its much larger competitor. Shares finished the month at record highs and up 11.60% for the period. At the same time, TSLA stock lost 14% despite rallying 30% from its low near $330 struck on Sept. 8. That’s good, right? Now, bulls are in the driver seat with a favorable broader market tailwind known as a follow-through day in place, Friday’s surprisingly strong, growth-filled monthly and Q3 deliveries data for Nio in hand.Oh, and the price chart will also help fuel further gains.
Source: Charts by TradingViewI’ve been bullish on Nio for some time now. Most recently, the stock was discussed at InvestorPlace as a purchase following late August’s corrective dip. The price action appeared to be a favorable opportunity to buy Nio on weakness. It was, but not before early September’s slightly larger penetration briefly took out technical support.More than proof of fallible price charts, a proffered collar strategy has thrived amid the volatility. Now, with Nio sitting near its prior all-time-highs after breaking out of triangular consolidation, the stock is demonstrating a pattern where relative and absolute price strength are worth buying into.My observation remains upbeat with the belief Nio can rally towards $30 by early next year. Again, though, and stressing even the best price action is merely a guide and not a guarantee of success, exposure in Nio continues to look well-served by a flexible, limited and reduced risk collar.For investors agreeable with what has been shared, one hedged vehicle of this kind which aligns itself with what we’re seeing off and on the price chart is the Nov $20 put / $26 call combination. Relative to Nio fetching $21.40 in the open market, this collar currently runs about 60 cents over the stock for a net purchase price of around $22.On the date of publication, Chris Tyler held, directly or indirectly, positions in Nio and its derivatives, but no other securities mentioned in this article.Chris Tyler is a former floor-based, derivatives market maker on the American and Pacific exchanges.

355,"Oct 5, 2020 1:07PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRight now, I’m going to give you one very good reason that long-term investors with multi-year horizons should buy small-cap stocks: The reality we live in today is being rapidly disrupted on all fronts.Electric vehicles are replacing diesel and gas cars globally. Autonomous driving is quickly becoming a reality. Plant-based foods are taking over grocery stores and fast food chains.Shopping and payments are increasingly becoming digitized. Consumer and legislative attitudes towards formerly taboo drugs like marijuana and psychedelics are fundamentally shifting. Gambling and sports betting are being legalized.Data is transforming and optimizing every facet of business. Clean energy costs have fallen to grid-parity, and consumer adoption is soaring. AR/VR technology is revolutionizing gaming.Robots are becoming a real, useful thing. Cloud computing is becoming ubiquitous. The space tourism boom is starting…I could go on and on.But the point couldn’t get any clearer.The world is rapidly changing. Faster than ever before. And where there’s change, there’s opportunity.So, over the next 5 to 10 years, there will ample opportunity for small companies on the cutting edge of these disruptive, next-generation megatrends to unseat incumbent giants who have fallen asleep at the wheel.Much like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is unseating Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM).Much like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has unseated Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT).And much like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has unseated movie theaters.All three of those disruptors used to be small-cap companies, and right now — given the accelerated pace of technology disruption happening across the globe — is as good a time as any to find the next Tesla, the next Amazon and the next Netflix in the small-cap world.To that end, here are three of my favorite small-cap stocks to buy for long-term investors: In short, Luminar is the world’s best LiDAR company, and therefore, represents a compelling long-term investment opportunity as LiDAR technology becomes ubiquitous across the automobile world over the next decade.Taking a step back, the key to making semi-autonomous and fully autonomous vehicles lies in enabling cars to have complete “vision” – or, more specifically, giving them a human-like ability to see and respond to their surroundings.Ideally, you want to do this with built-in cameras, since cameras are space and cost efficient. But computer vision has significant limitations, so it has become commonplace across the AV space to equip cars with add-on, laser light perception sensors called LiDAR which – while less space-efficient and more costly – are presently a much more robust solution for 3D sensing/perception than cameras.Over the next decade, as every car on the road becomes semi-autonomous or fully autonomous, every car on the road will be equipped with these LiDAR sensors.Because of this, the LiDAR space has become exceptionally competitive, crowded with tons of hardware tech companies trying to make the best LiDAR sensors.But the cream-of-the-crop in this industry is Luminar Technologies, a company that has created the industry’s only independent viable long-range LiDAR.Specifically, Luminar’s sensors feature max resolution of 300 PD (pixels/degree) and 250 meter range. All other independent LiDAR sensors in the world have a max resolution of less than 100 PD, and a range of less than 150 meters. Meanwhile, Luminar’s LiDAR is also weather resilient and interference-proof.That’s why 7 of the top 10 passenger car OEMs have partnered with Luminar, while one — Volvo — is set to start rolling out cars with Luminar LiDARs by 2022.So will begin a huge ramp in Luminar from no installations today, to being installed on tens of millions of cars every year by the end of the decade. As that ramp happens, Luminar stock will morph into a huge winner. One huge and rapidly growing vertical in the food and beverage market that is primed for disruption over the next decade is the energy drink category.At $60 billion, the global energy drink market is one of the larger beverage markets in the world. With a 7% compounded annual growth rate, it’s also the fastest growing beverage category.The major players in this space – Red Bull, Monster, and Rockstar – have innovated over the past several years, coming out with new flavors, new packaging, and new marketing. But they haven’t innovated where it matters… on the healthy eating front… and for the most part, they all still sell sugar-loaded, not-that-good-for-you energy drinks.This reality represents an enormous opportunity for Celsius Holdings, a $1.7 billion beverage company that is optimally positioned to significantly disrupt the $60 billion energy drink market with its breakthrough functional healthy energy drink.Leaning into its proprietary scientific formulation which combines green tea with EGCG, ginger, and guarana seed to catalyze thermogenesis, Celsius has a created a portfolio of unique, functional healthy energy drinks that have been proven to energize, accelerate metabolism, and burn body fat and calories… all at once.Plus, the drinks are vegan. Gluten-free. Non-GMO. Contain zero sugar. Zero preservatives. Zero artificial colors or flavors. Zero aspartame.You know… all the good stuff that young consumers are looking for in a “clean label” these days.To that end, Celsius has created a scientifically superior and socially more relevant energy drink which has the potential to turn into the next big thing in this massive category.Indeed, this is already happening.Celsius has grown its sales by 337% since 2015. Revenues are up another 90% through the first half of 2020. And the company is already the 11th ranked brand in the U.S. energy drink market despite only being in ~10% of potential distribution channels.A 10X increase in that U.S. distribution – coupled with international expansion, healthy eating mega-tailwinds, and the company’s best-in-breed functional energy drink products – create a clear pathway for Celsius to keep growing revenues at a robust rate for the foreseeable future, and for CELH stock to turn into a multi-bagger. Last, but not least, on this list of small-cap stocks to buy for long-term investors in psychedelics leader Mind Medicine.In case you haven’t heard, we are in the first inning of the Shroom Boom — a wave wherein shifting scientific research coupled with social de-stigmatization will pave the way for legalization and widespread usage of psychedelic-inspired medicines for things like anxiety, depression and addiction.It all started in 2014, with a small study at Johns Hopkins University which found that psilocybin – aka “magic mushrooms” – helped people quit smoking. Specifically, the study found that psilocybin led to an 80% quit rate among active smokers, more than double what was standard across other, non-psychedelic studies at the time.Since then, a wave of academic research has emerged which supports the notion that psychedelic-inspired medicines are effective and superior treatments for things like addiction, ADHD, depression, anxiety and anorexia. At the same time, the media – much as it did with marijuana a decade ago – is helping destigmatize psychedelics today, with multiple Netflix shows and documentaries like Have a Good Trip: Adventures in Psychedelics.Broadly, then, the psychedelics industry today is where the marijuana industry was in 2015/16, in the midst of the changing public perception phase. What comes next? The legalization and commercialization phases.That’s when Mind Medicine stock will explode higher.Mind Medicine’s portfolio of psychedelic medicines are aimed at two huge markets: addiction and ADHD. Both treatments are in Phase 1/2 trials.If MindMed is successful in bringing psychedelic-inspired medicines for addiction and ADHD to market – and the company should be – the potential upside in MindMed stock is enormous, mostly because this is a $145 million company attacking a $12.1 billion market in terms of opiod abuse and ADHD treatments.On the date of publication, Luke Lango did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The New Daily 10X Stock Report: 98.7% Accuracy – Gains Up to 466.78%.

356,"Oct 5, 2020 12:46PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt’s been a surprisingly quiet year for investors of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock. Shares are up just 26%, lagging far behind Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) 54% rise and Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) eye-popping near-400% gain. How did FB stock, a supposed winner of the work-from-home movement, get left behind? Actually, the company has been keeping up just fine.In the second quarter, Facebook blew Wall Street’s expectations out of the water. Revenues beat estimates by 7.4%, per-share profits by 22.7% and daily user growth by roughly 3%.These are staggeringly large beats for a $750 billion enterprise. And as the company weathers the 2020 election and coronavirus pandemic, shareholders will quickly realize one thing: that Facebook has become a spring-loaded stock.Investors, get ready for a great comeback for Facebook stock in 2021.While you’ll usually find me reporting on smaller tech companies that can grow 10x to 1,000x, Facebook deserves a special mention during these extraordinary times. The company, which also owns Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, has been a massive coronavirus pandemic success story. Facebook’s shares have lagged, but stand to rebound in 2021 as valuations catch back upIn Q2, Facebook’s revenue-per-share grew 10.2%, and profits almost doubled as advertisers shifted spending online. And it’s clear why advertisers chose Facebook in particular: the social media giant added yet another 200 million monthly active users (MAU) in 2020, bringing total users to 2.7 billion. The company now counts well over a third of the planet as actively monthly users. User engagement has also soared: 79% of active Facebook users now log in daily, an all-time high.Yet, these gains have gone almost undetected by Wall Street. Shares have lagged other tech giants as investors have fretted about Facebook’s slowing growth and turned their attention to younger upstarts like TikTok.Nonsense.Not only has Facebook done well in 2020. Analysts expect the company to do even better in 2021.  As the overall advertising industry regains health, analysts expect Facebook’s revenue to increase by 24% in 2021. Morningstar, a financial services firm, pegs the number even higher, at 34%.There are three critical reasons for optimism. Firstly, analysts expect overall ad spending to return to pre-pandemic growth in 2021. The extra advertising dollars will decrease competition and boost Facebook’s bottom line.Secondly, Facebook has emerged from this summer’s political stumble relatively unscathed. In June and July, the company faced a boycott by large brands and advertisers over its lack of controls over limiting hate speech. While these walkouts could dent Q3 numbers, the company has since installed enough measures to right the ship.Finally, the company stands to benefit from a societal shift toward social media news. And not just in the U.S. either. In India, Facebook’s largest market by users, a study by the Hammerkopf Consumer Survey found an 87% increase in social media usage during the beginnings of the coronavirus pandemic.And here’s what that means for Facebook’s value in 2021.Analysts expect Facebook to grow revenues at a moderate 13.8% CAGR over the next ten years. EBIT margins are expected to increase from 42.0% to 54.5% by mid-decade.Using these relatively conservative estimates (and projecting EBIT margins to revert to 42% by 2029), a 2-stage DCF model shows a fair value of $377/share or a 47.5% upside from today’s prices. In other words, Facebook’s underlying value has steadily marched upwards, even though its stock price has not.What about its fast-growing tech peers? A similar DCF model using the same discount rates on Apple shows a -10.9% downside. And what about Tesla, with its 400% YTD gain? A sweat-inducing -58.0% downside.These valuation issues show up in basic ratio analysis (a helpful guide I like to use outside of DCF models). Facebook trades for 23.6 times EV/EBIT – a high ratio, but not absurd for a software company. Apple, on the other hand, now trades for 27.0 times, a princely sum for a company that still earns 2/3 of revenues from hardware sales. And what about Tesla? The electric vehicle maker now trades at 307 times EV/EBIT, making it one of the most expensive large-cap companies in the world. In other words, Facebook remains quite cheap despite its rapid growth.Things won’t be 100% smooth sailing for Facebook, either. The social media firm must continue walking a fine line between maximizing user engagement and stopping the spread of misinformation. That’s no easy task in the era of partisan politics.The company also needs to address consumer privacy and antitrust concerns. Among other warning signs: in 2019, the Federal Trade Commission levied a record-breaking $5 billion fine on Facebook. “Despite repeated promises to its billions of users worldwide that they could control how their personal information is shared, Facebook undermined consumers’ choices,” said FTC Chairman Joe Simons. “The magnitude of the $5 billion penalty … is designed not only to punish future violations but, more importantly, to change Facebook’s entire privacy culture to decrease the likelihood of continued violations.”Finally, Facebook must continue innovating to stay on top. It acquired two of its most valuable properties (WhatsApp and Instagram) for just $5 billion together; WhatsApp now has 2 billion users, while Instagram has 1 billion. But can the company repeat its success? Perhaps, but even the mightiest of companies can always fall.When I invest in tech companies for massive gains, I look for companies with 1) strong proprietary software, 2) a great growth trajectory, and 3) proven management. Not only does Facebook have all three. Its shares are also screaming “it’s on sale!” relative to other U.S. tech companies. And that’s what makes me excited for this social media behemoth.Consumer shifts in the work-from-home era have given Facebook a much-needed lift. If the company can take advantage, shares could pop 40% in 2021. Perhaps it’s time to buy.On the date of publication, Tom Yeung did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Tom Yeung, CFA, is a registered investment advisor on a mission to bring simplicity to the world of investing.The post How Facebook Could Surge 40% in 2021, Crushing Apple and Tesla appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-facebook-could-surge-40-in-2021-crushing-apple-and-tesla-2020-10-05

357,"Oct 5, 2020 11:11AM EDT","Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) popped on Monday, rising as much as 4.5%. As of about 10:30 a.m. EDT, however, the stock was up 3.3%.The growth stock's gain comes as Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner released a note to investors saying that the stock's sell-off on Friday created a good buying opportunity.Tesla factory. Image source: The Motley Fool.Shares of Tesla declined more than 7% last Friday, following the electric-car maker's latest update on vehicle deliveries and production. Though the record 139,300 deliveries Tesla reported during the third quarter were slightly ahead of analysts' average estimate, they may have been underwhelming to some investors -- particularly since the stock has been on a tear over the last 12 months, leading to high expectations.The analyst noted that the deliveries were ""robust"" and that they prompted him to increase his revenue forecast for Q3 from $8.2 billion to $8.3 billion.In September, Rosner increased his 12-month price target for Tesla stock from $400 to $500 and changed his rating from hold to buy. The analyst reiterated this buy rating today.Â An upbeat morning in the overall market likely helped Tesla stock Monday morning as well. TheÂ S&P 500 was up more than 1% as of this writing.Next, investors will look to see if management reiterates its guidance for a total of 500,000 deliveries in 2020 when Tesla reports third-quarter earnings late this month or early next month. To achieve this guidance, the company will need another period of record deliveries.

358,"Oct 5, 2020 10:00AM EDT","Lithium AmericasÂ (NYSE: LAC) stock has produced electrifying recent gains. Shares of the Canada-based junior lithium mining company skyrocketed 44.2% in September and have raced out of the gate in October, gaining 29.1% in the first two trading days of the month. That brings their total gain to 86.1% in just over a month.The company isn't currently generating any revenue or profits. It has two mining projects under development: Cauchari-Olaroz in Argentina, a 51%-49% joint venture with China's Ganfeng Lithium, in which Lithium Americas is the minority owner; and Thacker Pass in Nevada. For context, the S&P 500 (including dividends) fell 3.8% last month and lost 4.2% from Sept. 1 to Oct. 2.Here's what investors should know.A lithium salt flat. Image source: Getty Images.We can probably boil the bulk of Lithium Americas' powerful recent market performance down to two related industrywide factors.Â First, expectations seem to be increasing that demand for lithium to make rechargeable batteries for electric vehicles (EVs) will be pulled forward relative to recent projections. (This sentiment excludes the shorter-term negative effect stemming from the pandemic.) In other words, the belief is growing that EVs will displace vehicles with combustion engines faster than previously expected.Second, lithium stocks, in general, are benefiting from increased awareness among investors of the lithium space. This factor stems from the growth in news coverage of EVs, which is how this catalyst relates to the first one.What's driving (pun intended) the belief that EVs are going to be kings of the road sooner than previously expected, and the rising investor awareness that they can bet on the EV revolution by investing in lithium stocks?Several things, including a California executive order and news from EV pioneer Tesla'sÂ (NASDAQ: TSLA) ""Battery Day.""Â On Sept. 23, California Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an executive order ""requiring sales of all new passenger vehicles to be zero-emission by 2035."" The order effectively bans the sale of new cars powered by fossil fuels within the state in 15 years. It also includes other provisions aimed at controlling climate change.Â  Not surprisingly, California is on track to be the first state in the U.S. to phase out gasoline- and diesel-fueled cars, though 15 other countries have also committed to doing so, according to the state's press release.The Golden State's move is obviously a boost for EVs, as the state is the largest car market in the country. Moreover, it seems likely that other states will follow California's lead.Â On Sept. 22, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced during the company's ""Battery Day"" plans to enter the lithium mining space. The aim of taking control of a key part of its supply chain is to ensure it has adequate lithium supplies and to lower its lithium costs.If Tesla is successful, it will mean that eventually, at least, it won't need to buy 100% of its lithium from third-party suppliers, as it does now.Â Overall, this news is a negative for lithium producers, as the industry will lose some key business if Tesla is successful. However, the event certainly brought the lithium industry to the attention of more investors.Â Data by YCharts.Here's the year-to-date performance picture for Lithium Americas stock.Data by YCharts.Investors should know that Lithium Americas stock is very speculative. As previously noted, the company is in the developmental stage, and isn't generating any revenue or profits.That said, it's worth watching.Less speculative investors interested in the lithium space might want to explore larger players Albemarle, Sociedad Quimica y Minera (known as SQM), and Livent. U.S.-based Livent is a pure play on lithium, while fellow U.S. company Albemarle and Chile-based SQM also produce other products.10 stocks we like better than Lithium Americas Corp.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The electric vehicle (EV) company, founded by car designer Henrik Fisker, will list on the NYSE later this year through the special purpose company. And at $14, SPAQ stock could reward investors handsomely. I’m typically wary of growth companies without any operating history. Fisker’s management also has completely unrealistic expectations for the company’s growth.But a closer look at the company business shows a company worth far more than its current $4.3 billion valuation. While I wouldn’t put in my entire life savings into this backdoor listing, here’s why SPAQ stock could become the next Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) if they play their cards right.For those less familiar with the SPAQ/Fisker deal, here’s a quick primer:A particular class of firms, known as Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPAQs), are blank-check companies that take other firms public. They typically hold cash in trust, issue shares worth $10, and either list a company or dissolves within a timeframe.Spartan Energy, one of these SPAQs, was created by private equity giant Apollo Global Management. And in July, the blank-check company agreed to merge with Fisker, an electric vehicle startup.Why is this important? That’s because SPAQ stock should theoretically never fall far below its $10 liquidation value before its merger with Fisker. That means investors have reasonable downside protection.My colleagues at InvestorPlace have already written some excellent articles on why SPAQ might be undervalued, given Fisker’s growth estimates. Even my estimates put SPAQ share value at $21.Would-be investors, however, should avoid using Fisker’s estimates in their valuations. Here’s why.In July, Fisker released an investor presentation projecting $13.2 billion in revenue by 2025. By outsourcing production to Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY), they reasoned, the company could instantaneously ramp up production to meet surging demand.That seems like a stretch, but let’s run with that for a moment. Imagine that management delivers on the proposed $13.2 billion revenue and a 14.4% EBIT margin. Using a 2-stage discounted cash flow (DCF) model shows a company value of $25.6 billion, or $87 per share, a 480% upside.Skeptical readers will immediately see an issue: $13.2 billion is a lot of money for a car maker. To reach that target, Fisker would have to sell 250,000 SUVs a year, or 62,000 more units than Tesla’s entire 2019 U.S. sales.Can that happen? Of course. But here’s why investors should stay skeptical.There are three reasons why investors shouldn’t expect more than $5 billion in revenue by 2025.1. Car Dealerships. U.S. states largely prohibit direct sales of cars to consumers. That means Fisker will face an uphill battle to open “brand experience centers” and pop-up stores. Tesla took years to establish itself, and many states still ban the EV company from making in-person sales.2. One Base Model. Fisker initially plans to sell just one SUV model, the Fisker Ocean. To reach $13.2 billion in revenue by 2025, the company would have to become roughly as popular as the Honda Accord or Jeep Grand Cherokee in the U.S.3. Financing Deals. Fisker plans to offer its leases at $379 monthly on a $2,999 down payment. No fixed term, unlike Tesla’s 36-month minimum. That means each “sale” will only net the company $7,547 in its first year.The final point could wreak havoc on Fisker’s balance sheet: having no fixed lease terms will reclassify the deals as “capital leases” rather than “operating leases.” In other words, unless their accountants can come up with a creative way to offload the leases or reclassify them, Fisker can only recognize $7,547 revenue in its first year.Had Fisker’s management thought of that, they would quickly realize that *if* 100% of their customers leased rather than bought, generating $13.2 billion (from a standing start) means selling 1.75 million leases, the equivalent of 10% of the U.S. car market.To see what’s at stake, let’s make a couple of assumptions:Using a 2-stage DCF model comes to a fair value of $6.2 billion, or $21 per share. That’s a 43% upside.However, there’s significant uncertainty in Fisker’s leasing situation. If the company needs 25% working capital to fund its capital lease program, its fair value immediately drops to just $16 per share, leaving only a 9% upside.On balance, SPAQ stock remains a buy. The $10 pre-merger price floor means investors have a limited downside if they buy today. And if Fisker succeeds, investors stand to earn multiples of their original investment.The company also has strong management, packed with BMW (OTCMKTS:BMWYY) and Volkswagen veterans. And despite CEO Henrik Fisker’s prior EV startup failure (prompted by a total recall of its outsourced batteries), he looks far better to succeed this time. The Spartan Energy team consists of experienced private equity managers from Apollo Global and may yet provide a viable financing source for Fisker’s leasing program.As Fisker looks to move beyond SUVs and into luxury sedans in 2023, investors should pay attention. If all goes well, Fisker and SPAQ could end up as the next Tesla.On the date of publication, Tom Yeung did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Tom Yeung, CFA, is a registered investment advisor on a mission to bring simplicity to the world of investing.The post SPAQ and Fisker Are Still a Buy, Despite Unrealistic Expectations appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/spaq-and-fisker-are-still-a-buy-despite-unrealistic-expectations-2020-10-05

362,"Oct 5, 2020 1:21AM EDT","Tesla’s (NASDAQ: TSLA) network of Superchargers enables Tesla drivers to recharge their cars in as little as an hour, reducing range anxiety and improving the experience of owning a Tesla. Below, we take a look at how Tesla’s supercharger network is expanding and compare its growth with the company’s cumulative deliveries and rival charging networks.View our dashboard analysis on A Closer Look At Tesla’s Charging InfrastructureTesla’s Supercharger Network Is Growing, But Not Quickly EnoughTesla’s Supercharger network has grown from around 1,200 stations in Q1’18 to over 2035 stations as of Q2’20. The number of Supercharger connectors, which indicate the number of vehicles that can be charged simultaneously, has expanded from 9.3k to 18k over the same period. The number of Supercharger connectors per Supercharger location has expanded modestly from 7.7 to 8.9 over the period. However, with the launch of the Model 3 and Model Y, and Tesla’s rapid production scale-up, the number of Teslas on the road is outpacing the growth of its Supercharger network. As Tesla’s Cumulative deliveries have grown from 320k in Q1’19 to 1.1 million in Q2’20, this means that the number of Vehicles per Connector has grown from under 35 in early 2018 to about 60 presently. Tesla owners can still use third-party networks (which may require adapters) although the speed and experience are unlikely to be the same as using Tesla’s own supercharging. How Does Tesla’s Network Of Chargers Compare With Rivals?Tesla is still ahead of its rivals when it comes to fast charging – with a total of over 9,600 supercharger points in North America. In comparison, ChargePoint, an independent network of EV chargers, has about 2,020 DC fast charging points while Volkswagen’s Electrify America network has about 2,000 points.  However, Tesla’s overall network, which includes fast chargers and slower Level 2 chargers stands at about 20k in North America. This is well behind ChargePoint which has close to 35k charging connectors.Further Buildouts, Battery Improvements Could Help Tesla Address A ShortfallHowever, there are a couple of ways Tesla could address a potential congestion issue. The first and most obvious solution would be to build out more Superchargers. Tesla now has adequate capital to do so, holding about $9 billion in cash as of the most recent quarter. In addition to this,  Tesla will likely count on improving the range of its new cars to reduce their dependence on chargers. Tesla can do this via more compact and cost-efficient batteries or other drivetrain improvements. For example, during its battery day event, the company said that its new “tabless” batteries could enhance range by 16%.

363,"Oct 4, 2020 1:26PM EDT","Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) slumped 13.9% in September, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The electric vehicle (EV) company is one of the most hotly contested stocks on the market, but so far bulls have been clear winners -- with the stock climbing roughly 396% year to date and nearly 500% over the last three years.Â ^SPX data by YChartsTesla stock experienced volatility early in the month due to waning excitement following its stock split at the end of August and the company being passed over for inclusion in the S&P 500 index. Shares saw additional pressure from analyst coverage and a mixed reception for the Battery Day conference it held on Sep. 22.Image source: Getty Images.Whether you're bull or bear or just keeping track of a high-flying industry leader, Tesla's double-digit slide last month should be viewed in context. The company's share price skyrocketed 74% across August's trading thanks to momentum for the business and excitement about its 5-for-1 stock. September's pullback looks relatively small in light of those gains, even though there were significant events driving the sell-off.Â On the heels of stock-split excitement dissipating, Tesla shares experienced a sell-off early in September after the company was passed over for inclusion in the S&P 500 index. The stock sank 15% on Sep. 8's trading after news hit that the company failed to gain a spot on the index.Inclusion in a major index is often a positive catalyst for stocks because investors buying index funds are buying stock in the included companies. There hasn't been an official explanation for why the S&P Dow Jones Indices team opted not to add Tesla to the S&P 500 index, instead choosing to add Teradyne, Catalent, and Etsy. However, it's possible that doubts about the EV leader's ability to post continued profits (consistent profitability is typically a standard for index inclusion) played a role. Tesla posted its first full-year profit when it reported fourth quarter results in January.Â Tesla shares rebounded in the week of trading following the indexing-related sell-off and then plateaued mid-month, then proceeded to tumble again after the company's Battery Day presentation underwhelmed investors and analysts. The event had been hyped as a potential showcase for revolutionary battery technology, but the tech may not have been as groundbreaking as some expected.Tesla did unveil its biscuit tin battery cell, which the company says will pave the way for a 16% increase in its vehicles' range capacity and also be less expensive to produce.Â Elon Musk and Co. also used the event to debut its high-powered Model S Plaid car and highlight new autopilot technologies, that Cybertruck had received over half a million preorders, and plans for an electric vehicle in the $25,000 price range. The conference featured plenty of notable news, but it was followed by coverage from multiple analysts branding the showcase a disappointment.Â Tesla stock has lost additional ground early in October's trading, after the company delivered third quarter results that appear to have underwhelmed Wall Street on some fronts. Volatility for the broader market and growth-dependent stocks in particular may have also been a factor in the dip. The EV company's stock is down roughly 3.2% in the month so far.^SPX data by YChartsTesla shares climbed on Oct. 1, but sank on Oct. 2 after the company announced vehicle deliveries that fell short of the market's expectations. The company delivered 139,300 vehicles in the third quarter, a new quarterly record, but some investors seem to have been looking for even greater performance.Tesla is now valued at $387.5 billion and trades at roughly 224 times this year's expected earnings and 13 times expected sales.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

364,"Oct 4, 2020 9:00AM EDT","By David RandallNEW YORK, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Investors on Wall Street can add another layer of uncertainty to a market already unnerved by last month's sell-off, stalled fiscal stimulus and President Donald Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis, which weighed on stocks on Friday.     A higher capital gains tax that could accompany a win by Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is also emerging as a potential counterweight to this year's powerful rally in stocks.Biden has proposed taxing capital gains and dividends as ordinary income, which would increase the tax rate from 20% to 39.6% for individuals and couples earning over $1 million, the highest tax bracket.That policy - which would likely be easier to enact if Democrats also win the Senate and retain control of the House - may push some investors to lock in gains ahead of December if Biden emerges the winner in the Nov. 3 vote, fund managers said.Tax-motivated selling would likely be most pronounced in technology and other momentum stocks and could push the broad S&P 500 index lower between November and the end of the year, said Eddie Perkin, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance.""If you have enough people looking to harvest gains, that has an impact on the stocks that have led the market, and the big tech stocks could be where people choose to sell at the end of the year,"" he said.On Friday, President Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis triggered a sell-off in stocks and oil as investors moved away from risk assets.  But many tech and momentum stocks are sporting healthy gains for the year despite a sell-off that pushed the S&P 500 down 3.9% in September, its first monthly loss since March.Tesla Inc TSLA.O, for instance, is up 436% for the year through Friday, while Zoom Video Communications Inc ZM.O is up 610% and Amazon.com Inc is up 74%. The S&P 500 index as a whole is up 3.8% over the same time.That kind of momentum may be difficult to slow, especially if it is aided by seasonal trends. November and December tend to be among the best months for stock performance, boasting an average gain of 1.34% and 1.57%, respectively, for the S&P 500, according to research firm CFRA.""The third quarter is usually weak, but when it is really strong, like it was in 2020, this says the rally isn’t over yet,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.Still, some believe a Biden victory would provide a strong incentive for profit-taking. SELLING 'AHEAD OF SCHEDULE'Chris Cordaro, chief investment officer of RegentAtlantic, believes a broad Democratic victory will likely lead to more stock market volatility as soon as the results of the election are known as investors start selling winners.He has been counseling some clients to generate more income this year as opposed to in 2021, by taking money out of retirement accounts, which would add another layer of selling, he said.""You're going to see people selling things that they would be selling anyway, but ahead of schedule,"" he said.Investors in the coming week will be keeping an eye on minutes from the Federal Reserve's most recent monetary policy meeting, due out Wednesday, for insight on how the central bank views the nascent recovery in the United States. Higher taxes do not always lead to increased selling. Overall, the capital gains tax rate could go as high as 40% before having widespread effects on investor behavior and discouraging investment, according to a paper by Princeton University economics professors Owen Zidar and Ole Agersnap.Personal income tax rates are more likely to affect the market's winners this year, Cordaro said, while increased corporate taxes would most likely lower valuations across the stock market over the next year.By 2024, however, enactment of Biden's proposed tax measures and other policies would cut just 4% off of estimated earnings for the S&P 500 compared with baseline estimates, according to Goldman Sachs.Increasing corporate taxes while the global economy is still trying to recover from the coronavirus pandemic could dent the rally in the stock market and cut into company plans to hire or invest in new projects by eating into after-tax net income, saidhedge fund manager J. Daniel Plants, who runs Voce Capital Management.""History teaches us that this is the worst possible moment to subject the economy to the type of massive tax increases that Biden is proposing, especially the changes that would impede capital formation and make domestic job creation less attractive,"" he said.(Reporting by David Randall.

365,"Oct 4, 2020 6:32AM EDT","Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), saw his net worth briefly cross the $200 billion threshold earlier this year. He's the richest man in history, and he added billions to his wealth during the COVID-19 pandemic -- a time when millions, perhaps even including yourself, were unemployed and waiting for federal stimulus checks to buy groceries.Bezos isn't alone. Consider a recent headline from Business Insider: ""US billionaires' wealth grew by $845 billion during the first six months of the pandemic."" At first glance, it looks like billionaires are getting richer at the expense of everyone else. That hardly seems fair.However, there's another headline you may have missed. American household wealth is at an all-time high, having recovered trillions in value since the lows following the coronavirus outbreak. Are you wondering how that's even possible? The sad reality is the wealth gains haven't been evenly distributed. But the good news is what's worked for the rich can work for you too.Image source: Getty Images.According to a report from the Institute for Policy Studies, eight billionaires increased their net worth by over $1 billion each from the beginning of 2020 through April 10. The organization dubbed these billionaires as ""Pandemic Profiteers."" The list includes the aforementioned Bezos, TeslaÂ CEO Elon Musk, and Eric Yuan of Zoom Video Communications.When news broke that Bezos was worth over $200 billion, protestors descended upon his house, according to the Washington Examiner. The protest called for raising employee compensation to a minimum of $30 per hour, but it took a dark turn as protestors assembled a guillotine on the sidewalk. Suffice it to say many people aren't happy with the disproportionate creation of wealth for Bezos and other billionaires.Ensuring all stakeholders are justly compensated is an important conversation. However, there's a common misconception regarding net worth. Protestors claimed Bezos makes $4,000 per second in income, and similar statements abound in cyberspace. But in reality, billionaires are getting richer because their assets, like stocks, are increasing in value.Â AMZN data by YChartsBezos, Musk, and Yuan own a ton of their own companies' stock. For example, at the end of 2019, Bezos owned over 75 million shares of Amazon -- a nice perk from founding the company. His net worth increases as the stock rises, but he's not getting paid thousands of dollars per second. In reality, his CEO salary is just $81,840 and doesn't include any ongoing stock-based compensation. In short, there's a big difference between wealth and income.According to the Federal Reserve, U.S. household net worth is also rising due to increasing asset value -- just like the aforementioned billionaires. Much of Americans' wealth is in real estate, which has increased $900 billion in value since the beginning of 2020. Additionally, a full 27% of American household wealth is currently in the stock market. And, believe it or not, stocks are up in 2020.American household net worth was $119 trillion as of the second quarter of 2020. This is up by approximately $8 trillion since the first quarter. Granted, it's less than a 1% increase from the fourth quarter of 2019. But it's a record high nonetheless.So billionaires have enriched themselves in this tumultuous 2020, yes. However, they're not alone. These numbers show many American households have never been richer.Image source: Getty Images.This doesn't mean wealth gains have been evenly distributed; on the contrary, there is a wealth gap. Again according to the Federal Reserve, the bottom 50% of Americans owned just 1.4% of the wealth. By contrast, the top 10% have 69% of the pie.Â That's hardly proportionate. Furthermore, low-income workers remain unemployed in high numbers compared with those in higher-paying professions.More companies need to embrace the primary tenets of conscious capitalism -- the business practice of increasing value for all stakeholders. And legislators should actively pursue opportunities aligning with our ""justice for all"" national mantra. But on an individual level, I believe there's an urgently actionable takeaway. To create personal wealth, you must use some of your income to acquire assets. Those who do have gotten richer in 2020.Bezos, Musk, and Yuan are entrepreneurs who've created multibillion-dollar businesses from scratch. Maybe that's not you. Nevertheless, you can still align your future net worth with successful billionaires like these by investing in the stock market. Stocks are an incredible wealth-creating tool, allowing common folks like you and me to build wealth from businesses taking the world by storm. And it's exactly how many everyday Americans got richer even during a global pandemic.The stock market doesn't care if you're rich or poor; it's available to virtually anyone, and the bar to get started has never been lower. Brokerages have introduced new features like commission-free trades, fractional shares, and no account balance minimums, all which can help you get started today.10 stocks we like better than AmazonWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

366,"Oct 3, 2020 10:35AM EDT","As expected, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) reported a record number of vehicle deliveries in its third quarter. The total number of deliveries, however, was even greater than analysts' average forecast. Fueling the quarter's growth was a huge increase in combined Model 3 and Model Y vehicles.Based on those figures, the electric-car maker may now be on track to hit its original aggressive target of 500,000 total deliveries in 2020.Image source: The Motley Fool.Tesla delivered approximately 139,300 vehicles in its third quarter, up 43% from the 97,000 or so it delivered in the prior-year period.About 124,100 of those were Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, while an estimated 15,200 were the automaker's more expensive Model S and X vehicles. In Q3 2019, the Model Y hadn't launched yet, and total Model 3 deliveries were nearly 80,000. Combined Model S and X deliveries were about 17,500.And for a statistic that highlights how quickly Tesla has recovered from its factory shutdowns earlier this year, third-quarter deliveries were up 53% sequentially.Going into 2020, Tesla said it expected to deliver more than 500,000 vehicles this year, which would have amounted to an increase of 36% or more. But the automaker refrained from reiterating this guidance when it delivered its first-quarter update. At that time, its factory in California was shut down in order to comply with California's efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19. In the company's July 22 second-quarter update, however, Tesla reaffirmed that it expected to deliver 500,000 vehicles.Had it failed to deliver a record number of vehicles in Q3, investors would have had good reason to be concerned about Tesla's ability toÂ  hit that full-year target. But after Tesla's significant sequential jump, it's starting to look feasible.To pull it off, the automaker will need a strong finish -- specifically, it will need to deliver more than 181,000 Teslas in Q4 alone.Can the company do it?Based on information provided in its second-quarter update, the automaker has installed enough vehicle production capacity to pull off this feat. But it's still not totally in the bag.At that time, Tesla said its Fremont factory boasted the capacity to produce 400,000 Model 3 and Y vehicles annually, as well as 90,000 Model S and X vehicles. In addition, the company said it was installing machinery at its Fremont factory to increase its annual Model 3 and Y production capacity by 100,000. Further, Tesla's Shanghai factory had the capacity to manufacture 200,000 Model 3 cars a year. On a quarterly basis, this translates to about 172,500 to 197,500 vehicles total, depending on whether the Fremont factory upgrades are in operation yet.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are theÂ ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Walmart wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.See the 10 stocksStock Advisor returns as of 2/1/20This video was recorded on September 25, 2020.Chris Hill: We begin with big retail. Costco's first quarter report was pretty much everything a shareholder could want. Profits and revenues were higher than expected, digital sales nearly doubled, same-store sales up more than 11%. And, Jason, shares down a little bit on Friday; are we not entertained?Jason Moser: [laughs] Well, I was definitely entertained; it was a good quarter. And again, the market is selling the stock modestly; I wouldn't read too much into it. I think part of the market's reaction here is, we're pretty far into this pandemic and I think we're closer to things getting back to somewhat normal or at least we're seeing that trend. And so, that ultimately means that shopping behaviors are going to start to normalize to a degree. And I think the big question, and maybe the question that the market is focused on really is, will Costco be able to hold on to the current behavior and then keep growing from here or is there going to be some kind of a reset for the business?And going to the performance that you were talking about there; earnings per share of $3.13 versus $2.47 a year ago; very strong. Fourth quarter membership fee income was up modestly from a year ago. Total paid households, though, I thought this was really impressive, total paid households at the end of the quarter came in at 58.1 million, that compares to 53.9 million a year ago. So, clearly, they're getting more households to buy into that membership model. And I think the other concern is given the state of things today, you know, one of the big value props for Costco is gasoline. And as people don't go there to get as much gasoline, there is a little interplay there in traffic for the stores, and we certainly saw traffic on a worldwide basis down modestly. Although, in the U.S. it was up slightly, and transactions have grown a bit as people continue to stock up. So, all in all, a very good quarter. I think the market is just really looking forward and asking itself that question of, do we have to hit a reset button here at some point or not? And I think that's a fair question.Andy Cross: I think what's interesting about Costco, we hear this a lot from a lot of retailers, and, Jason, you just touched on that a little bit, is that even though the traffic into the stores might be down, the amount they're buying once they're in is way up. We saw this big-time with Starbucks, and I think for others too. So, you start to see fewer trips to the stores, but when you're there you're stocking up, you're buying things. And I think that really bodes well for Costco, which [laughs] obviously has that history and the actual brand of going there and buying a lot of stuff, lots of big stuff. And the more and more we're stuck inside our houses, the more and more we actually need stuff that Costco sells. It's interesting, I don't know if they talked about their business traffic being up or down, Jason, but that might have been interesting too, because fewer people are now in offices, and Costco did serve a pretty good-sized business community.Hill: First quarter digital sales for Nike (NYSE: NKE) rose 82%. Profits were higher than expected, and shares of Nike hitting are another all-time high this week, Andy?Cross: Yeah, a great quarter from Nike. Revenues were flat, and that was ahead of estimates. But what we continue to see Nike do so well is really innovate on the digital side. They started investing in the digital space a few years ago. They brought on John Donahoe, CEO, who came over from ServiceNow, and before that in PayPal, he brought a real digital focus. Their digital sales were up 82% this quarter as compared to 75% the previous quarter. They added $900 million in incremental sales just from digital. They're seeing 200% growth in demand for the Nike commerce app, so that's just like buying on activity. They're seeing a 100% growth in monthly active users on that app.And what's important with that, Chris, is that the direct business has a 10% higher gross margin than their wholesale business. So, overall, Nike continuing to really get it done and continuing to innovate in the space when it comes to their brand, launched Nike Maternity, launched Nike Yoga with a fabric that they've been in production for two years in development. They launched Space Hippie, of which we have a pair here, that's an incredible sell-through product, which is really sustainably sourced shoes. So, the direct-to-consumer business for Nike and the innovation they've been putting in there has really been helping.And the connected fitness, Nike active members to the connected fitness app was up 60%. They hit an all-time high of percentage of users using the Nike Training app. So, you get the brand, the business, and the technology innovation, they're really doing and have been emphasizing and investing into, and that's been a really big win for Nike, and obviously for shareholders as the stock is doing really well.Hill: You know, Andy, we're at that point in the year where people are trying to figure out what sort of holiday retail year we're going to be in for. Nike is talking pretty optimistically about the holidays, but I don't know if that necessarily bodes great things for the retail landscape or just Nike.Cross: No, I think it bodes better for Nike. Just again, getting back to the innovation. But the push to direct-to-consumer, that's really been the innovation for them. Their stores are back open, but their retail traffic, as I mentioned before with the retail traffic in general, that's down for them. So, even though their traffic is down, they continue to boost growth into that really important direct-to-consumer and really tying together the digital experience and making it much more brand focused with their one Nike marketplace, I think that is a big innovation for one of the best branded consumer companies in the world, and now really becoming a technology powerhouse in the retail space.Hill: Shares of AutoZone (NYSE: AZO) down 6% this week despite a strong fourth quarter report. Profits and revenue came in higher than expected. Jason, same-store sales are up more than 20%, my goodness!Moser: Yeah. I mean, this was another one of those really excellent retail reports that we've seen recently; and there have been a few of them, Nike and now AutoZone. A bit of a home improvement angle here I think, in that the market they serve is a fairly resilient one, given the role that automobiles play in all of our lives. And AutoZone had noticed earlier on -- the stimulus, for example; the first round of stimulus helped their line of work and we saw the same thing play out with Advance and O'Reilly, an additional one will likely serve them well also.And let's face it, the stores are open for business and there's a right way to go about things, so traffic is relatively OK. But they enjoyed, actually, their largest quarterly same-store sales performance ever since going public in 1991 at 22%. So, that tells you what kind of a quarter it was. But now going back to Costco, I think we have to ask ourselves the question, is this the new normal? Are we going to have to hit a reset button? And we're really not there yet, but we'll get some more clues as the quarters go.But again, the numbers, I think, came across very nicely. If you look at actual topline revenue, it is only growing at around 21%, but then you see how well they were able to bring it down to the bottom-line with net income up 41.2%, earnings per share up 47.6%. They didn't make any share repurchases at all, and have kept inventory in line as well. So, when you look at this space, AutoZone and O'Reilly are the clear leaders, kind of like the Home Depot and Lowe's dynamic. And I suspect that even if they have to hit a reset button with the business later on, it's still going to be a very good business and one that shareholders should feel good about.Hill: On the flipside, Stitch Fix (NASDAQ: SFIX) stumbled to the end of its fiscal year; the fourth quarter loss was much bigger than expected. You know, Andy, the stock is still up around 35% over the past year, but this was one of those quarters that you look at and you go, yeah, they've got their work cut out for them.Cross: Yeah, Chris, it wasn't a bad quarter, they added 9% more new members; that about matches what they did in the third quarter. Their revenues were up about 11%. Revenue per client was up about 2%. But I think what people are focused on, I certainly am, is looking at the clients they brought in during that COVID period, between March and May, and they had those new clients. Typically, in their models, in their history, those clients come back and they order more and more, but they didn't see that. Stitch Fix really pulled back their marketing during that time to save money, and so that hurt their subsequent fix buys -- what they call their fixes -- subsequent buys for those members. And that's going to continue into the year.So, I think that has some concerns with analysts and investors. This only means that's something to watch, otherwise they do continue to innovate, they do continue to have progress with the members they have been bringing in recently, so over the last couple of months, adding more and more to their baskets and buying more. But the concern about whether those members, and the ones they brought in this year, are going to be able to continue to add additional revenue, and is their lifetime value lower than what historically has been, I think has some concern on the analyst front and on the investor front.Hill: How concerned should they be about the ways in which, I'm going to call it nontraditional apparel companies, and I'm thinking primarily of Target and the way Brian Cornell, the CEO there, has been so focused on apparel at Target over the last two to three years -- is that a major concern or is that, sort of, on the backburner?Cross: No, I think it is a concern. The competitors are getting more and more sophisticated when it comes to digital experiences; we just talked about Nike, and there are many, many others out there. Stitch Fix has been pivoting, they had a lot of success with what they called their direct buy, so you no longer have to order something, wait for it to be delivered; you can actually now buy stuff directly from their website and that's outperforming their expectations. There is a lot of return purchase health there. So, they are continuing to innovate, they have these digital stylists that they work with, they have a lot of data scientists that they work with to help get the best measurements and the best fit, but they're not the only ones in the space, and there are a lot of innovation from some really good retailers out there. A lot of, obviously, challenges from the retail space too, but on the digital side, a lot of retailers are doing some really good things out there.Hill: Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) are down 8% this week. The CEO, Elon Musk, made a number of announcements at the company's investor day, and apparently some investors didn't like what they heard. Andy, to the extent that there was a theme here, it was timelines being pushed back. The cheaper model of the vehicle is going to take a few years, the batteries that were unveiled at the event are not going to go into mass production until 2021. It seems like Musk was being pretty reasonable.Cross: Yeah, I think there was also maybe -- from the Battery Day event -- that they didn't have quite the huge big announcement maybe some people were expecting, especially on addressing the so-called million-mile battery. But still, overall, a lot of innovation from Tesla. Coming out with the tabless battery, so they removed the tab that connects the cell into what it's powering, to increase that range by 16%, boost car power by 600%, to drop the kilowatt/hour -- that's the real key, they have to drop that kilowatt/hour because they want to be able to go to that $25,000 level for the mass market to really get the car down to a level the mass market can afford. From the leaked email about deliveries in Q3 of 2020 that will be at record levels, but not so much greater maybe than what they were the last record in the end of Q4.So, overall, it is interesting when Tesla continues to, as Jason mentioned expectations, if it doesn't continue to really, kind of, boost those expectations for a massive growth, those growth momentum investors who've been getting involved, who don't have a long-term horizon, probably start selling off the stock.Hill: Well, it could be worse. Nikola shares were down 40% this week after Founder Trevor Milton resigned as Chairman of the Board and deleted his Twitter account in the wake of fraud charges. Both the SEC and the Justice Department are investigating the electric truck maker on the potential that the company misled investors. Jason, this really isn't a good look. I mean, maybe it's all a big misunderstanding, but the immediate resignation combined with disappearing from social media, it really doesn't look good.Moser: No, it doesn't. And I would tell you, there was a pretty good little trolling effort there on Twitter where somebody essentially turned him into a male version of Elizabeth Holmes and put him in like the black turtleneck with a little bit longer blond hair, and you're thinking, oh, my God! This is just [laughs] this is bad blood all over again. Maybe we are jumping the gun here, maybe this is not as bad as it looks. But you know what? Where there is smoke, there is often fire. And there are enough red flags here for investors to at least take a pause and say, you know what, there's no reason to rush in anything like this, they don't have a product, they don't make any money. And I'll tell you what, it's amazing [laughs] that it's still a $7 billion market capitalization company. I mean, that is the time that we're living in right now. It does make you realize, economics aside, what Tesla and what Elon Musk has done to-date and their ability, really, to keep on moving forward and all of these companies trying to play catch up. And you really start to see some desperation from competitors.Hill: Andy, it really seems like there are other places to invest your money.Cross: Yeah. I mean, his response to the Hindenburg Research report was, this is all you got, out on Twitter. I mean, really, this is another example of why you really shouldn't be chasing these stocks from founders that you just don't have the confidence in, that we really need to see if they're going to build a business. Like Jason said, a $7 billion company, no revenue, all hype, a lot of promises out there, SEC investigation, BP backed away from their partnership to build the hydrogen fuel station. So, there are so many high-quality growth companies out there that you can invest in that have so far less speculation.Hill: Quibi, the fledgling video streaming service that launched earlier this year to much fanfare and very few subscribers, is reportedly exploring strategic alternatives. Among the alternatives being explored are an IPO or selling the company outright to Amazon, Apple, Disney, or Comcast. And Jason, all of those companies have deep pockets, and none of them should spend it on this business.Moser: [laughs] Well, Chris, you know I won the drawing this week for our monthly pizza day, so I was lucky enough to have a pizza delivered here to our home thanks to The Motley Fool, and with my girls both here doing school for the day, that pizza is now gone. So, I'm exploring strategic alternatives as far as what I'm going to do for lunch, because it's resulting in nothing. And I think very much that Quibi is going to ultimately result in nothing. It feels like the question that should've been asked that probably was not asked when this business was started was, if the content is there but there's nobody to watch it, does it even exist? Because you can have content if you want, but if you don't have people watching it, who cares? I mean, they do have some content, I don't know if that is very compelling. And I think the biggest problem is that I don't think anyone, including Mr. Katzenberg, really knows what Quibi is to begin with. It was never very well defined. I don't know if it's supposed to be social or streaming or social-streaming, what void it is trying to fill.And so, much like investing, sometimes you just have to be able to call it, admit the mistake and move on or you just keep burning money. And I have a feeling that is what we're watching play out here. Perhaps, with his connections in the industry, there is some type of interest in making an acquisition. But I'll tell you what, any company that jumps in there to make an acquisition of this business, I would hold that against them, because I think it's essentially a writedown to zero in very short order.Hill: Security is a priority for any homeowner, and Amazon is here to help. Remember back in early 2018 when Amazon bought Ring, the smart doorbell company? Well, this week Amazon unveiled the Ring Always Home Cam, a flying drone camera that patrols the inside of your house. Andy, it's coming in 2021, it's a cool $250. How many do you think you'll be buying?Cross: Well, we don't even have an Alexa in our house, so I think the answer is zero. I have to say, when I first saw it, it was pretty cool. [laughs] The little thing pops out when you're gone, flies away. The commercial that they have out there, the one that I saw is not, I think, super-inspiring [laughs] with what it shows with the criminal breaking into the house, but I do think the technology looks kind of neat for those who really care about their monitoring. It gets to the big questions of privacy and data and who is owning what and what are they seeing, and do I really need this?Hill: She's a tenured Professor of Behavioral Sciences at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and host of the podcast Choiceology. We'll pick things up when I ask Professor Milkman about financial windfalls and how we should deal with them when they come our way.[...]Katy Milkman: You know, I think one of the things that behavioral science has shown people do poorly is, think about financial windfalls. We tend not to make the best use of these opportunities. The first and best use of that windfall is to look at your debt. And if you have debt, you want to pay that down and you want to start with the highest interest debt and pay as much of that down as possible and if you can pay that off completely then go to your second-highest interest source of debt and so on, because debts are something that can become a vicious cycle, right? That interest just accumulates and accumulates and it's part of the reason why half of Americans didn't have that $400 they might need for an emergency when surveyed just a couple of years ago. And so, that is my No. 1 most important piece of advice.Right. After you've paid down your debt, I think having that emergency fund would be the next place you think about if putting a windfall is really important, because we don't actually appreciate how often we are likely to run into emergencies. There's this really fascinating research led by Abby Sussman, who's a Professor at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business, showing that when people look at their inflows and outflows into accounts over the course of a year, they'll see, like, all these weird things. Every month, they sort of think, oh, you know, I have to pay my rent, I have to pay these other consistent bills, my car insurance and so on. They recognize that those are recurring expenses and they think about that as their budget, but then they'll see these, like, weird things that come up every month. Oh, you know, I had an unexpected doctor's appointment. Well, that's just unexpected, that doesn't happen normally, they don't think about that in their budget. Oh, then the next month their drain broke and they had to pay a plumber to come in to repair, but that was an emergency.Basically, what they do is they look over the year and they discount all these things that come up. And they say, that's not something I have to plan for, but it turns out they come up every month, [laughs] they're different every month, but something always happens. And that's part of why I think people don't make the wisest budgets, because of this mentality that if it is a constant and consistent payment, I'm not going to think of it as something I need to account for. But these surprises are predictable, they come up over and over again. So, we need to have that emergency cash reserve to cover that in our budget. So, that'll be my second piece of advice.And I think that's enough, [laughs] I'll let you ask any other questions you have, but I hope that helps.Hill: It absolutely does help. One of the things that you've written about deals with how we can change habits, and obviously, change habits that aren't great into more positive habits, that is something you call temptation bundling. Before I ask you to explain temptation bundling, just out of curiosity, because you have this expertise, how many of your students or maybe what percentage of your students in a given year will say to you in an office setting, like, a one-on-one setting, hey, by the way, aside from the curriculum I've got this one habit ... like, how many are seeking out your advice for how to improve a single bad habit that they have?Milkman: That's very common. And by the way, I welcome it. And the classes I teach are about behavior change, and I think my students, you know, take insights from class as useful for their careers. You know, how can they manage a team at work and try to help people make better decisions, how can they make better decisions in their finances, how can they make better decisions in their personal lives. And you know, they solve little problems that come up over and over. I think that's great, I want it to be all of the above. So, it's very common for students to come and talk to me about personal problems, as well as professional ones. And I hope I am consistently [laughs] helpful with both.Hill: Temptation bundling. What is it and how can I make it work for my benefit?Milkman: [laughs] So, temptation bundling is actually -- by the way, I should say, I do what I call me search. [laughs] Many scholars study problems they have and try to figure out like, oh, what are systematic solutions? So, you'll see people who struggle with social interactions, a social psychologist trying to figure out how they can be better at a cocktail party. Or economists who struggle with their finances, like, becoming experts in this area. So, I do that too. I definitely struggle with maintaining good habits, and I study it in part because I think that it's so weird and quirky and interesting and that we can come up with solutions.Temptation bundling is a solution to a problem I had when I was a graduate student and I realized I could help other people too. So, when I was a graduate student, I had two problems. One problem was, at the end of a really long day, I was incredibly tired and I found it really hard to motivate myself to go to the gym, even though I know it was good for me in the long-term and that I needed to exercise to have energy; it just wasn't where I wanted to be after all those classes. But then the other problem was that what I really wasted time doing when I should've been studying was that I was really into reading lowbrow fiction. So, I would curl up with a page-turner when I should have been doing my homework. And I realized I could actually solve both of those problems at once if I did the following. I only let myself read page-turners while I was at the gym exercising. And by doing that, all of a sudden, I stopped wasting time at home reading these books when I should have been working on my problem sets for my classes. And at the end of a long day, I found myself craving a trip to the gym, like, eager to find out what happens next in my novel. And when I was at the gym, I didn't even notice the time passing and it wasn't even painful to work out, because I was so engaged in this gripping thriller that I just didn't notice.So, it solved all of these problems for me. And I realized maybe that actually -- I started calling it temptation bundling. I was like, maybe I'm not the only one who has dual problems that could be solved this way. What if we, one, could systematically study this and see if it helps people to combine something that is really tempting to them with something that they know they should do but sort of resist. They often feel they shouldn't -- you know, they're too lazy to actually get to doing. So, can we make these combinations?And I started seeing other opportunities to do it in other parts of life. So, we studied it and showed that actually if you, for instance, lock people's tempting audio novels at the gym and tell them they can only access them at the gym, it helps people exercise up to 50% more. Those are some results from a big experiment we ran early on, this kind of combination helps people a lot. And then we also have recognized that it's not just exercise and tempting books or binge-watching TV, there's all sorts of other ways in life you can combine things.So, my students only let themselves pick up their favorite drink at Starbucks that they crave every morning when they're heading to the library to study, and those two things are combined for them. Or you could imagine only allowing yourself to binge-watch your favorite TV show while you're doing household chores, and listen to your favorite podcast while you're out for a run. So, you can sort of pick what are these things that you might be able to combine to get the best of both worlds.Hill: When I was doing some research, I came across a piece that you wrote for The Washington Post a few years ago. Time got away from me, so I didn't read it, but the headline was amazing, so I'm going to ask you about it now. The headline was Heat doesn't just make us cranky. It makes us dumb shoppers. Now, I'm very familiar with the concept that you should never go grocery shopping when you're hungry, I'm aware of that one and I try not to do that. And now that I've come across this headline, I'm grateful that the weather has turned, you know, wonderfully autumnal here in Northern Virginia. What is it about the heat that makes us so dumb when it comes to shopping?Milkman: Oh, my gosh! That's such a funny headline. And by the way, I should say, if you write op-eds for newspapers, they pick the headlines, you don't. I think they have some optimization algorithm [laughs] that they --Hill: That's a good headline.Milkman: I guess. [laughs] It was an article, actually, about research. And I was, sort of, reviewing other people's research showing that our emotions are triggered by the weather. And that on unusually hot days, we actually are angrier and we make a lot of bad decisions. So actually, my favorite study is not about shopping, and it was featured prominently in this, it was about baseball players. Pitchers are more likely to hit hitters on hot days, on unusually hot days. And the analysis was really carefully [laughs] done to control for like, oh, are they sweatier? It was like unusually hot days, unexpected heat that seemed to make people angry or more likely to try to hurt players from the opposing team.We make bad decisions about all sorts of things when we're overheated, when the weather is unseasonable. We also, by the way, are more likely to believe in climate change, it turns out, on days that are unseasonably warm. So, it's really interesting how we're affected by these fluctuations in temperature. Our environment shapes our decisions in all sorts of interesting ways.Hill: It really seems like the more I learn about your field of expertise, almost like the more self-aware we all have to be if we want to, sort of, optimize who we are at work, who we are in our personal lives. It can sound both rewarding, but also a little daunting.Milkman: Yes, I think that's true. The field that I'm part of, I'm a behavioral scientist, and what we do really is we study the imperfections in human nature, the ways that people deviate from being perfect, optimal, rational decision-makers who are just like calculators, like Captain Spock from Star Trek, right, who never make a silly move. And recognizing all your mistakes and all your flaws can be [laughs] a little bit overwhelming because there are a lot of them. But I think a more useful way to think about it is, one, recognize it's OK, humans, and it's not just you, we're all flawed, we don't come with a perfect operating system, so cut yourself some slack when you screw up, when you yell at someone when you shouldn't have. Or you make an impulsive purchase or buy a stock that you wish you hadn't or whatever. It's not like you are the most flawed human in the world, we're all flawed, everybody is screwed, [laughs] it's human nature.So, I think that, No. 1, is empowering; and then, two, it actually doesn't matter most of the time, because most of our decisions are low stakes. If you pick the wrong flavor of ice cream, it's not going to be the end of the world. If you pick the wrong spouse, that's a bigger deal. You know, if you really make the wrong choice of career, that's a bigger deal. If you buy the wrong house, that's a bigger deal. So, I think it's useful to say don't worry about or don't sweat the small stuff. And the fact that you will goof, that's human nature. But it can be useful to learn more about making good decisions and really focus and try to talk to experts when you're making those big life decisions.Hill: How have you applied this to your financial life? How does Katy Milkman invest?Milkman: I buy index funds, and I sit on them. [laughs] And that is what I do. So, I do not believe that I know how to do better, frankly, on the stock market than a monkey throwing darts. And so, I have a diversified portfolio of index funds. And my retirement portfolio, I contribute the maximum amount to my 403(b) plan at my university, and it's in a target date fund. [laughs] And that is my mantra. Like, I don't think I can pick the right stocks, I never cash out when there's a crisis, I leave it. I don't look at it regularly, there's research showing that when you check your stock portfolio more frequently, you're also more likely to invest in bonds rather than stocks. And stocks, obviously, there's a premium for equity, so you want to -- you know, I just don't look, I don't look during these bumps, because I want to smooth over those periods.Actually, sorry, I'm quoting that research wrong, it's a paper on the equity premium puzzles, and here's what it was. It's by Richard Thaler, from University of Chicago, and Shlomo Benartzi. And I was giving you the punchline, but not actually the finding. So, the finding is that you can explain away the equity premium puzzle, which is like, why isn't everyone investing in stocks, everyone should be investing and they dramatically outperform bonds. And the answer is, if people looked at their portfolio once-a-year that would be often enough, given our degree of loss aversion, which is like how much we hate seeing our portfolio go down. Once-a-year would be enough to explain the equity premium puzzle in terms of people's feelings of loss that they would experience and their aversion to that, that could explain the whole thing.So, that leads me to say, like, the less often we look, [laughs] the less often we'll experience that loss and the less likely we will be to pull out of stocks and make the wrong decision to be heavily in bonds.[...]Hill: Our email address is Radio@Fool.com. Question from Adam Travis in Brooklyn. He writes, ""I'm a new investor with just one year of experience so far. Aurora Cannabis was the first stock I bought last year and it's done just about as badly as a stock can possibly do. Any advice for a stock market novice like myself?""Andy, Adam's got an experience that I think is common for a lot of people who are just starting out. All the more reason you want to build out that portfolio as soon as you possibly can.Cross: Yeah, you really want to be able to diversify that portfolio. So yes, that one, that stock has not worked out. We do have those sometimes that don't work out in our portfolio. I certainly do, and I know many of us do. So, you want to make sure you diversify that portfolio, building out your highest quality candidates, continuing to save and invest as a new investor. That's really important.Also, make sure when you diversify, you can also think about very local index funds and ETFs too to really get that broad diversification in your portfolio, don't be a one-stock wonder.Hill: Yeah, Jason, we've seen that before, right? We've heard from people who've said, I bought one stock, it went down, and I'm out of the stock market for life.Moser: Yeah. And that's the challenge too, right, for new investors. Especially because when you're getting started, really, you're starting from zero. And so, for a while you are not going to be diversified, because you're going to buy one stock and then another and another. So, it does take some time, and I think that's why when you're getting started, like Andy said, you either start with something like an index fund or you start with companies in more reliable spaces, with more reliable business models and more history of success. Something like, you know, we're talking about Costco. I mean, that's been a wonderful investment for so many folks for so long. So, just be aware that when you pursue those new markets like marijuana, for example, there's potential, but they have a lot to prove still.Hill: All right. Let's get to the stocks on our radar. Our man behind the glass, Dan Boyd, is going to hit you with a question. Andy Cross, you're up first, what are you looking at this week?Cross: Oh, great. I'm going with Inspire Medical Systems (NYSE: INSP), symbol INSP. A $3.3 billion technology health company that aims to help the 100 million people worldwide who suffer from sleep apnea. It created their first closed-loop implantable stimulator to monitor breathing and deliver a little pulse if it notices a little block in the breathing pattern. So, it's helping 17 million potential people in the U.S., it's an alternative to the CPAP machine that you damn may have seen advertised on TV and is currently widely used.It's addressing a $10 billion market opportunity, which is more than 500,000/year who are qualified for this kind of device. So, it's not a lot of revenue, very innovative, really focused on helping sleep apnea around the world. So, I'm looking at Inspire Medical, INSP, Dan.Hill: Dan, question about Inspire Medical.Boyd: Well, Chris, not so much of a question as a comment. Sometimes I go to conventions and sometimes I share a room with people to cut down on costs. And one time I shared a room with the guy who brought his CPAP machine and I was sent to the underworld every night for the entirety of that con, because it was like a fan but 3X as loud.Cross: That person should be one of the 9,000 people who Inspire has helped with their sleep apnea problem to date, Dan.Hill: Jason Moser, what are you looking at this week?Moser: Yeah, I'm excited to see Unity Software (NYSE: U), ticker U, finally go public. They are now trading on the public markets as of this week. And Unity Software operates a 3D development platform. Ultimately, they have software for creators. They create, run, monetize interactive and real-time content. 2D, 3D, mobile phones, tablets, PCs, consoles, very large presence in augmented reality and virtual reality devices. Reputation for a really strong presence in the gaming industry, but they have done a very good job of stepping beyond just the gaming industry. So, whether it's healthcare or engineering, aviation, anything, Unity is becoming a platform for creators everywhere.And we're seeing a lot of impressive numbers as of June of this year. They had approximately 1.5 million monthly active creators in just about every country around the globe. And the applications developed were downloaded over three billion times per month in 2019, on over 1.5 billion unique devices. So, clearly a company with a very big reach, and glad to see it out there for investors now.Hill: Dan, question about Unity Software?Boyd: Absolutely. Jason, the video game space is very crowded, very competitive, and also very expensive to produce. What makes Unity special, how does it stand out?Moser: Yeah, I think that really is in the immersive content, right? The augmented and virtual reality content that they're able to help produce, that really is seen as the next leap forward in gaming and in other types of immersive experiences.Hill: What do you want to add to your watchlist, Dan?Boyd: I'm looking at Inspire. I mean, if anything, that cut down on snoring in the wild, man, I'm all for it.Hill: [laughs] All right. We're out of time. That's going to do it for this week's show.

369,"Oct 2, 2020 5:34PM EDT","By Jeff LewisTORONTO, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Brazilian miner Vale SA VALE3.SA is in talks with Tesla TSLA.O and others in the electric vehicle (EV) supply chain about securing nickel from its Canadian operations, the head of the miner's base metals unit said on Friday.Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Tesla CEO Elon Musk in July urged miners to produce more nickel, a key ingredient in the batteries that power the company's electric cars. Musk offered a ""giant contract"" if supplies could be produced in an environmentally sensitive way. While EVs are expected to help reduce global carbon emission, environmentalists are concerned that production of EV parts and increased mining may damage the environment.Analysts have also warned of a supply deficit for nickel, which makes batteries energy dense so cars can run further on a single charge.Tesla and other automakers need to ensure there is sufficient nickel available to produce the number of batteries required for EVs over the next five to eight years, Mark Travers, Vale's executive director of base metals, told Reuters.""So that is the nature of the discussions I’m sure that is occurring across the industry right now and, without specifically commenting on Tesla, those are the conversations we are having right now,” he said.Asked whether Vale and Tesla have held discussions, Travers said: ""Yes, absolutely.""Vale, whose Canadian operations span three provinces, is in the midst of expanding its Voisey's Bay site to an underground operation that will produce about 40,000 tonnes of nickel-in-concentrate per year.The miner has dedicated about $2 billion to low-carbon projects across its base metals unit, including electrification of underground vehicles, fuel switching and heat recovery, Travers said.In Canada it is also studying potential to store carbon in tailings at its operations in Thompson, Manitoba, he said.Such considerations are ""a key focal point"" in discussions with automakers and other EV participants, he said.""The discussions around environmentally friendly nickel are front and center,” he said.(Reporting by Jeff Lewis; editing by Grant McCool)((Jeff.Lewis@thomsonreuters.com; +1 647 200 7236))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/miner-vale-in-talks-with-tesla-ev-sector-for-canada-nickel-executive-2020-10-02

370,"Oct 2, 2020 5:34PM EDT","Just three months ago, car manufacturer Nikola Motors (NASDAQ: NKLA) was being lauded for pushing the limits of the auto industry, and its stock soared following its IPO. Then came the bad news. And more bad news. And more. Today, the troubles have hit like a hurricane, and with every day that passes, the bricks come tumbling down faster. What caused Nikola's fall from grace? And how did it happen so fast?Nikola's current misery traces back to a September fraud allegation, in which Hindenburg Research asserted that the electric semi Nikola One truck was, in fact, an ""elaborate ruse.""Â Further, the research firm described Nikola's proprietary battery technology -- which some predicted would revolutionize the industry -- as ""vaporware."" Image source: NikolaHindenburg Research was short  Nikola stock prior to the release of the report, and Nikola claims that Hindenburg timed the release to benefit from the stock price surge after its General Motors partnership announcement.Â How valid are the accusations in the Hindenburg report? Can investors  trust the short-seller's research?Hindenburg has already benefited from the more than 30% plunge in Nikola's stock price, but investors do not have to take Hindenburg for its word along. Nikola itself issued a statement commenting on the report, and in it, the company fails to deny many of the allegations lodged against it.Â The big red flag: Nikola released a January 2018 promotional video of its 2016 hydrogen-electric powered semi-truck that makes it appear like the truck is cruising down the highway. In fact, the semi was actually rolling down a hill without power. Hindenburg claims the semi-truck was a non-functioning prototype. Nikola, however, sidestepped the issue, explaining that the Nikola One semi was originally designed to run on its own. Then, the company scrapped the project to design a second generation of its prototype vehicle.Nikola's non-answer sounds like a very weak excuse to investors who once saw it as the next Tesla.Â Instead of attempting to debunk the claims, Nikola claimed that Hindenburg Research had misconstrued the truth. The company's ""refutation"" of the short-seller's claims essentially states that:Nevertheless, nothing in Nikola's press release seems to do much to support the assertion that Hindenburg's claims were false. Even if  electric vehicle company never claimed to have a working prototype built using in-house components, many of its investors seemed to think that way and the company did not appear to be working diligently to correct any misconceptions.  Investors began jumping ship after the allegations came to light.If that wasn't bad enough, Nikola CEO Trevor Milton resigned effective Sept. 20, less than two weeks after the report was published. In addition, a reported deal between energy giant BP and Nikola has fallen apart.Â Image source: Getty ImagesNikola was once applauded as a revolutionary company in the auto industry. Now, there seems to be some confusion about whether it can truthfully make that claim.Â According to a Financial Times report, the Department of Justice has launched a probe into Nikola in response to Hindenburg's claims, and the Securities and Exchange Commission has also begun its own investigation. However, at the end of September, the company's management reaffirmed their commitment to producing the 100% electric-battery Nikola Tre truck, slated for customer availability in the fourth quarter of 2021. It also aims to create a hydrogen-fueled prototype of medium- and long-haul trucks that should be ready for testing by the end of 2021. Additionally, Nikola's newly-announced partner General Motors pledged to continue supporting the embattled automotive company. It has stated that it intends to sell its own hydrogen and battery systems to Nikola while engineering and building the company's Badger pick-up truck for the U.S. market. Indeed,  that GM plans to build its own clean-energy vehicle line may prove to be the only boon left to Nikola. Regardless of its previous murky claims, the fact that a well-established car manufacturer intends to produce a Nikola-conceptualized vehicle (albeit using GM systems, engineering, and production lines) means that the upstart could actually manage to sell a working vehicle one day.Â 10 stocks we like better than Nikola CorporationWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

371,"Oct 2, 2020 5:02PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA poor jobs report and news that President Donald Trump has tested positive for Covid-19 weighed on the stock market on Friday. With that in mind, let’s get to some top stock trades in the meantime. Nio (NYSE:NIO) reported solid third-quarter delivery results on Friday, but you wouldn’t know it by the stock’s reaction. Same with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).However, unlike Tesla, Nio stock isn’t wavering as much. In fact, the stock is holding up near its prior breakout level.In late August and early September, Nio stock was rejected by the $21 level. It didn’t help that the company raised additional funds and the stock market took a solid dip (as did Tesla).However, Nio never broke stride, as uptrend support continued to hold (blue line). This week, shares were able to breakout over $21 and hit the 161.8% extension (for the entire range).Let’s see if the stock can continue to hold up over the 10-day moving average. If it can, it will keep bulls looking for a move over $22.59, the current all-time high. Above that could trigger a rally to the two-times range extension all the way up near $26.40.On the downside, a break of the 10-day moving average puts uptrend support and the 50-day moving average in play.Earlier this week, Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) reported a much better-than-expected earnings result. Now, shares are ramping higher on the week, up more than 40%.The stock is reclaiming a vital mark near $17.50, as well as the declining 200-week moving average. I know it’s quite the rally, but as long as shares are over $17.50, I find it hard to be bearish.Plus, this stock had a short interest north of 60%. That puts the potential for a massive short squeeze higher on the table. If BBBY can rally further, look to see if it can extend up to the 138.2% and 161.8% extensions at $22.73 and $26.02, respectively.American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) is trying to get some upside momentum going. Shares are struggling with the 10-day, 20-day and 50-day moving averages.If AAL can gain momentum over these marks, it puts $14 resistance in play. Above $14 could really get the group moving, potentially putting the 200-day moving average on the table.The $14 level was resistance in June. Above that and the 38.2% retracement is possible.On the downside, a break of this week’s low at $12 could put recent range support on the table near $11. If the stock gets there and it holds as support, it’s more wait-and-see trading from AAL as it remains rangebound.A close below $11 support is more bearish, though.Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) has a great-looking chart right here.The stock exploded higher on Monday, rallying about 25%. And all week the stock has been forming this nice-looking bull flag.That action comes as the 50-day moving average continues to hold as support and as the 10-day moving average finally catches up to the stock.Now what?I want to see a rotation over this week’s high at $20.98 and longer-term resistance at $21. Above that could get a quick move to the 38.2% retracement, up at $21.83.From there we’ll need to see how SPCE stock is trading. However, above this level could open the door to the 50% retracement at $25.78. It also puts the $26 to $27.50 area on the table, which came into play near the July highs.On the downside, a break of the 200-day moving average — which was solid support until September — would be very damaging to the bull case in the short term. It could put a gap-fill in play toward $16.50, followed by support at $15.On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.The post 4 Top Stock Trades for Monday: NIO, BBBY, AAL, SPCE appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-top-stock-trades-for-monday%3A-nio-bbby-aal-spce-2020-10-02

372,"Oct 2, 2020 4:52PM EDT","By David RandallNEW YORK, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Investors on Wall Street can add another layer of uncertainty to a market already unnerved by last month's sell-off, stalled fiscal stimulus and President Donald Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis, which weighed on stocks on Friday.     A higher capital gains tax that could accompany a win by Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is also emerging as a potential counterweight to this year's powerful rally in stocks.Biden has proposed taxing capital gains and dividends as ordinary income, which would increase the tax rate from 20% to 39.6% for individuals and couples earning over $1 million, the highest tax bracket.That policy - which would likely be easier to enact if Democrats also win the Senate and retain control of the House - may push some investors to lock in gains ahead of December if Biden emerges the winner in the Nov. 3 vote, fund managers said.Tax-motivated selling would likely be most pronounced in technology and other momentum stocks and could push the broad S&P 500 index lower between November and the end of the year, said Eddie Perkin, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance.""If you have enough people looking to harvest gains, that has an impact on the stocks that have led the market, and the big tech stocks could be where people choose to sell at the end of the year,"" he said.On Friday, President Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis triggered a sell-off in stocks and oil as investors moved away from risk assets.  But many tech and momentum stocks are sporting healthy gains for the year despite a sell-off that pushed the S&P 500 down 3.9% in September, its first monthly loss since March.Tesla Inc TSLA.O, for instance, is up 436% for the year through Friday, while Zoom Video Communications Inc ZM.O is up 610% and Amazon.com Inc is up 74%. The S&P 500 index as a whole is up 3.8% over the same time.That kind of momentum may be difficult to slow, especially if it is aided by seasonal trends. November and December tend to be among the best months for stock performance, boasting an average gain of 1.34% and 1.57%, respectively, for the S&P 500, according to research firm CFRA.""The third quarter is usually weak, but when it is really strong, like it was in 2020, this says the rally isn’t over yet,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.Still, some believe a Biden victory would provide a strong incentive for profit-taking. SELLING 'AHEAD OF SCHEDULE'Chris Cordaro, chief investment officer of RegentAtlantic, believes a broad Democratic victory will likely lead to more stock market volatility as soon as the results of the election are known as investors start selling winners.He has been counseling some clients to generate more income this year as opposed to in 2021, by taking money out of retirement accounts, which would add another layer of selling, he said.""You're going to see people selling things that they would be selling anyway, but ahead of schedule,"" he said.Investors in the coming week will be keeping an eye on minutes from the Federal Reserve's most recent monetary policy meeting, due out Wednesday, for insight on how the central bank views the nascent recovery in the United States. Higher taxes do not always lead to increased selling. Overall, the capital gains tax rate could go as high as 40% before having widespread effects on investor behavior and discouraging investment, according to a paper by Princeton University economics professors Owen Zidar and Ole Agersnap.Personal income tax rates are more likely to affect the market's winners this year, Cordaro said, while increased corporate taxes would most likely lower valuations across the stock market over the next year.By 2024, however, enactment of Biden's proposed tax measures and other policies would cut just 4% off of estimated earnings for the S&P 500 compared with baseline estimates, according to Goldman Sachs.Increasing corporate taxes while the global economy is still trying to recover from the coronavirus pandemic could dent the rally in the stock market and cut into company plans to hire or invest in new projects by eating into after-tax net income, saidhedge fund manager J. Daniel Plants, who runs Voce Capital Management.""History teaches us that this is the worst possible moment to subject the economy to the type of massive tax increases that Biden is proposing, especially the changes that would impede capital formation and make domestic job creation less attractive,"" he said.(Reporting by David Randall.

373,"Oct 2, 2020 4:39PM EDT","The stock market had a tough day on Friday, and the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) suffered the brunt of the downdraft. Concerns about news that President Trump and other prominent officials in the administration have tested positive for COVID-19 were enough to take the air out of the rally earlier this week. The Nasdaq ended up losing more than 2% on the day.The most prominent stocks in the Nasdaq have been among the best performers recently, and both Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) have made solid contributions to the bull market. On Friday, though, both finished sharply lower. Here's why.Tesla shares finished down more than 7% on Friday, giving up all their gains from earlier in the week. The automaker released its much-anticipated delivery numbers for the third quarter, and given how good they were, it's somewhat surprising to see the stock fall in response.Tesla's Semi. Image source: Tesla.Tesla reported that it delivered 139,300 vehicles during the third quarter. That included 124,100 Model 3 and Y units, along with 15,200 Model S and X vehicles. Production figures were slightly higher, with Tesla making more than 128,000 Model 3s and Ys and almost 17,000 Model S and X units for a total of 145,036.The delivery numbers were the best in Tesla's history, and they were also better than what most of those following the stock had anticipated. Nevertheless, the company has done a good job in the past of wildly surpassing expectations, and it's possible that its failure to do so this time around was enough to pull down the high-flying auto stock.Yet to keep some perspective, Tesla's value is still double what it was as recently as late June. For long-term investors, it's hard to treat small one-day drops like this as a big deal.Elsewhere, Netflix shares lost almost 5% of their value on Friday. Having faced some pushback on a controversial new release, the streaming video giant might have seen more customers leave than normal.Analysts at Bank of America's securities division didn't make any changes to their overall views on Netflix stock, keeping their buy rating and maintaining the $575 per share price target they've put on the video entertainment provider. However, BofA did note that industry data shows a slightly higher churn rate for September than Netflix had earlier in the summer. It attributed part of that churn to Cuties, which has gotten criticism for its initial promotional poster and the trailer's depiction of the content of the series.In addition, downloads of Netflix software have dropped lately. Competition from other streaming services has only increased recently, and the return of some popular forms of content, including sports, is also putting pressure on Netflix.It was always going to be hard for Netflix to sustain the pace of growth it enjoyed at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. What remains to be seen, though, is whether the company can maintain a good balance between making the most it can from its pioneering video streaming service and ensuring that customers get the content they want at a price they're willing to pay.10 stocks we like better than NetflixWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

376,"Oct 2, 2020 4:00PM EDT","By Stephen CulpNEW YORK, Oct 2 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed lower on Friday as news that U.S. President Donald Trump tested positive for COVID-19 put investors in a risk-off mood and added to mounting uncertainties surrounding the looming election.Tech shares weighed heaviest on the indexes, but the blue-chip Dow's losses were mitigated by gains in economically sensitive cyclical stocks.Trump tweeted late Thursday that he had contracted the coronavirus and would be placed under quarantine, compounding the unknowns for an already volatile market.But stocks pared losses after the White House provided assurances that Trump, while experiencing mild symptoms, is not incapacitated. ""This injects further uncertainty into the outcome of the election,"" said Roberto Perli, head of global policy research at Cornerstone Macro in Washington. ""My read is that markets have demonstrated an aversion of late especially to uncertainty, not so much to one or the other candidate winning."" Equities also got a brief boost after U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi's announcement that an agreement to provide another $25 billion in government assistance to the airline industry was ""imminent."" ""Markets are also paying attention to the likelihood that another stimulus package will pass soon,"" Perli added. ""If that happens it could offset at least in part the uncertainty generated by the COVID news."" House Democrats passed a $2.2 trillion fiscal aid package on Thursday, but the bill is unlikely to be approved in the Republican-controlled Senate. Partisan wrangling over the size and details of a new round of stimulus have stalled, over two months after emergency unemployment benefits expired for millions of Americans.Data released on Friday showed the recovery of the labor market could be losing steam. The U.S. economy added 661,000 jobs in September, fewer than expected and the slowest increase since the recovery began in May.

377,"Oct 2, 2020 1:48PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWell, there is never a “bad time” to go public. Fisker, though, took a different route through a reverse merger with Apollo Global Management-affiliated Spartan Energy Acquisition Corp. (NYSE:SPAQ), bringing another EV player into the market. SPAQ stock spiked as a result of the announcement. And although it has cooled down somewhat, shares are still up almost 36% over the past six months.The SPAQ/Fisker deal will yield more than $1 billion of gross proceeds that the newly minted enterprise will use to bankroll the development of the all-electric Fisker Ocean through the start of production in 2022. If all goes according to plan, the company will start generating some serious dough from 2023 onward.Overall, considering the red-hot state of the EV sector, SPAQ is an exciting spec play that is worth your time.Although there was a lot of excitement surrounding the merger, there is also some justified trepidation. Henrik Fisker’s first company Fisker Automotive filed for bankruptcy in 2012. Henrik Fisker is a Danish-American automotive designer and entrepreneur who has designed a lot of automobiles. But the question on everyone’s mind is whether he can parlay his success as a designer into the automobile sector.A couple of things to note here. Fisker has assembled an impressive team that will lead the company. It includes former executives from BMW (OTCMKTS:BMWYY) and Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY), apart from Fisker himself. So, there is undoubtedly some experience there that the company can tap into.The EV market is also vastly different from the landscape in 2012. There was still a lot of confusion surrounding EV vehicles and their viability back then. But the fog has cleared. Electric cars are the future of the industry. Every major car manufacturer globally, from Ford (NYSE:F) to Toyota (NYSE:TM), is now firmly behind the concept and wants a piece of the pie.Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced record deliveries, as did Chinese EV maker Nio (NYSE:NIO). The market cap for the former stands at $379.56 billion. Toyota sits at $185.48 billion.The markets have made up their mind and are going green. More importantly, so have administrations.Recently, California Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an executive order effectively banning the sale of new gasoline-powered passenger cars and trucks by 2035. In a media briefing explaining the move, he said that the measure is expected to help climate change initiatives and presents an “economic opportunity to transform our economy.” The move was met with mixed emotions.On the one hand, many environmental groups praised the governor for taking such a bold step. However, many also felt that the plan was unfeasible, considering the mammoth infrastructure requirements needed to be put in place.Regardless, climate change is slowly taking center stage in our national debate. That bodes well for companies with their products tailored as a solution rather than a problem in the issue.And it’s just not the States. China has passed legislation that wants new energy vehicle sales to account for 25% of total auto sales by 2025. Anywhere you look, and the theme is largely the same. Countries all over the world want to increase the share of EVs in new vehicle sales. If we look at the first half of 2020, only Norway has a sizeable EV sector, so there’s plenty of space to grow. This will be a great long-term tailwind for SPAQ stock. Although we have talked up the tailwinds for the company, let’s touch upon some of the risks associated with the stock.Perhaps the biggest issue that Fisker faces is its stalled partnership with Volkswagen. As part of the arrangement, Fisker will have access to the German automaker’s MEB electric-car platform. However, the agreement was signed in 2017, and we are still not sure when the agreement will be finalized. VW’s supply chain is key to Fisker’s future success, with the batteries, the chassis and software of the Ocean hinging on the success of this partnership.As per a recent investor presentation filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Fisker could not sign a “cornerstone agreement” with Volkswagen, something expected to be done by the end of July. Hopefully, the company can get this done and dusted soon so that its supply chain issues get addressed.Also, Fisker is entering a highly competitive market. We’ve extensively covered some of the leading players of the EV sector. The bottom line is that the fight for market share is just beginning. Plus, no company has done exceedingly well in the space, apart from Tesla.Fisker plans to be the world’s first digital car company. The company will not employ sales clerks; instead, this will be done through a mobile app. That will help drive down costs, but as InvestorPlace‘s Josh Enomoto said, design sets the company.While I get the fact that Tesla hires excellent designers, this is a technology firm that’s building an EV. On the other hand, Fisker is an automotive company first, incorporating technology to complement the design element.Ultimately, there is space for everyone at the table, so long as you provide a quality product. Ford used to dominate the auto sector, and now Jim Farley has the unenviable task to dig it out of a hole. A decade ago, Tesla was an afterthought, and now it happens to be one of the most valuable companies in the world.That’s why SPAQ stock is a bet that is worth taking.On the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. Faizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

383,"Oct 2, 2020 11:24AM EDT","By David RandallNEW YORK, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Investors on Wall Street can add another layer of uncertainty to a market already unnerved by last month's sell-off, stalled fiscal stimulus, and by President Donald Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis, which weighed on stocks on Friday.     A higher capital gains tax that could accompany a win by Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is also emerging as a potential counterweight to this year's powerful rally in stocks.Biden has proposed taxing capital gains and dividends as ordinary income, which would increase the tax rate from 20% to 39.6% for individuals and couples earning over $1 million, the highest tax bracket.That policy - which would likely be easier to enact if Democrats also win the Senate and retain control of the House - may push some investors to lock in gains ahead of December if Biden emerges the winner in the Nov. 3 vote, fund managers said.Tax-motivated selling would likely be most pronounced in technology and other momentum stocks and could push the broad S&P 500 index lower between November and the end of the year, said Eddie Perkin, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance.""If you have enough people looking to harvest gains, that has an impact on the stocks that have led the market, and the big tech stocks could be where people choose to sell at the end of the year,"" he said.On Friday, President Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis triggered a sell-off in stocks and oil as investors moved away from risk assets.  But many tech and momentum stocks are sporting healthy gains for the year despite a sell-off that pushed the S&P 500 down 3.9% in September, its first monthly loss since March.Tesla Inc TSLA.O, for instance, is up 423% for the year through Thursday, while Zoom Video Communications Inc ZM.O is up 592% and Amazon.com Inc is up 72%. The S&P 500 index as a whole is up 4.6% over the same time.That kind of momentum may be difficult to slow, especially if it is aided by seasonal trends. November and December tend to be among the best months for stock performance, boasting an average gain of 1.34% and 1.57%, respectively, for the S&P 500, according to research firm CFRA.""The third quarter is usually weak, but when it is really strong, like it was in 2020, this says the rally isn’t over yet,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.Still, some believe a Biden victory would provide a strong incentive for profit-taking. SELLING 'AHEAD OF SCHEDULE'Chris Cordaro, chief investment officer of RegentAtlantic, believes a broad Democratic victory will likely lead to more stock market volatility as soon as the results of the election are known as investors start selling winners.He has been counseling some clients to move more income into this year as opposed to next year by taking money out of retirement accounts, which would add another layer of selling, he said.""You're going to see people selling things that they would be selling anyway, but ahead of schedule,"" he said.Investors in the coming week will be keeping an eye on minutes from the Federal Reserve's most recent monetary policy meeting, due out Wednesday, for insight on how the central bank views the nascent recovery in the United States. To be sure, higher taxes do not always lead to increased selling. Overall, the capital gains tax rate could go as high as 40% before having widespread effects on investor behavior and discouraging investment, according to a paper by Princeton University economics professors Owen Zidar and Ole Agersnap.Personal income tax rates are more likely to affect the market's winners this year, Cordaro said, while increased corporate taxes would most likely lower valuations across the stock market over the next year.By 2024, however, enactment of Biden's proposed tax measures and other policies would cut just 4% off of estimated earnings for the S&P 500 compared with baseline estimates, according to Goldman Sachs.Increasing corporate taxes while the global economy is still trying to recover from the coronavirus pandemic could dent the rally in the stock market and cut into company plans to hire or invest in new projects by eating into after-tax net income, saidhedge fund manager J. Daniel Plants, who runs Voce Capital Management.""History teaches us that this is the worst possible moment to subject the economy to the type of massive tax increases that Biden is proposing, especially the changes that would impede capital formation and make domestic job creation less attractive,"" he said.(Reporting by David Randall.

384,"Oct 2, 2020 11:23AM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLast month, I discussed the peculiar narrative behind hydrogen fuel cell specialist Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG). Starting off as one of the most promising technology startups, PLUG suffered years of disappointment. However, the novel coronavirus pandemic has brought the company into a new light considering the vulnerabilities associated with fossil-fuel-based global supply chains. Suddenly, the left for dead Plug Power is now one of the hottest names on Wall Street.But that wasn’t really my angle. Rather, I noted that PLUG has a very strong mathematical relationship with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares. At the time, I wrote the following:From the beginning of this year, Plug and Tesla shares have recorded a 97% correlation coefficient. Mathematically, the two securities in terms of their trajectory — I’m not talking about nominal price levels of course — are virtually identical.I still stand by what I wrote because a) it’s math and b) the comparison still stands. From the start of January to the end of September, both PLUG and TSLA share a 97% correlation (96.8% if you want to be precise). Essentially, wherever TSLA goes, so too does PLUG.Naturally, this led me to declare that if you want to buy Tesla at $13, you should instead consider PLUG. Although the two were trending nearly identically, the law of small numbers favored the profitability potential of Plug Power securities. Granted, it was a wild ride, but PLUG is finally making good on its mathematical relationship.Nevertheless, what has bothered me about the strong relationship between PLUG and TSLA is that these two are similar largely in the sense that they’re both alternative energy platforms. Of course, the key difference is that Tesla focuses on battery plug-in vehicles while Plug Power specializes in hydrogen fuel cells.Interestingly, Tesla’s Elon Musk derided fuel cells as “fool cells” and “mind-bogglingly stupid.” Again, these are his words, not mine. But the takeaway is this: both are attempting to save the environment but through different methodologies.However, the case for battery electric vehicles seem more economically viable than hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. As battery tech improves, the cost for EVs has gone down, steadily making them affordable for people with modest incomes. Unfortunately, the same can’t be said about FCEVs.While FCEVs are more efficient, the cost of hydrogen-based fuel is very expensive. Thus, this cost profile must come down for FCEVs to make sense. Coincidentally, the correlation between PLUG and TSLA has weakened recently.To back up, in the year-to-date, the correlation between the two is 97%, a direct relationship. But from the end of July till end of September, the correlation dipped to 78%. While still a direct relationship, that’s a magnitude deceleration of nearly 20%.In my opinion, that’s significant. We’re talking about a transition from a near-identical relationship to one that is very strong. This suggests that cracks are now beginning to surface for PLUG in its tracking of TSLA shares. Is it time for speculators to abandon this trade?While I can understand why some traders would have some concerns, the collective data is starting to look remarkably intriguing.First, the fundamentals. While costs have been a sour spot on PLUG and other FCEV-related plays, increased scale of hydrogen fuel cell production alone could help reduce overall costs, making this platform viable irrespective of technological breakthroughs.Second, there are political incentives to consider Plug Power. As you know, California Governor Gavin Newsom issued a sweeping executive order to ban the sales new gasoline-powered cars by 2035. It’s this kind of extreme progressive ideals that make the Golden State such a wonderful place to live. Not only that, California’s laws like AB5 fostered the destruction of the gig economy.I think that’s so awesome because without the government, we would be completely helpless.Anyways, the political trajectory is certainly great news for both PLUG and TSLA. Therefore, in the near term, I would expect the direct correlation between them to continue.And that brings me to both the technicals and the mathematical rumblings. Yes, the correlation did dip in recent months. However, that doesn’t mean the overall implication has changed. Instead, it appears that PLUG and TSLA are forming different formations but with the same bullish intent.I’ve created this side-by-side chart so you can see my thought process. With PLUG, I believe we’re looking at the “finishing touches” of a bullish flag formation. Currently, the bulls and bears are negotiating vigorously, producing a consolidation channel.At the end of this consolidation channel, we should see a resolution to the upside. A similar concept is occurring with TSLA.Here, the EV manufacturer has seen its aggressive trading whittle the price action down to an apex, possibly resulting in an explosive move higher.In the near term, I fully expect both PLUG and TSLA to jump to the upside. When you have positive fundamentals for both, and both shares are charting bullish signals, it’s no surprise that their correlation coefficient is likewise robust. Therefore, this is a high-confidence bullish trade for the next several weeks.But once that bullish move is completed, I still have some questions. I’m not entirely sure that EVs and FCEVs will split market share with gasoline-powered platforms. Typically, Americans like their choices in binary terms; that’s probably why you don’t see a viable third party in U.S. politics and why there might never be one.Bottom line, enjoy the profits that are about to come up. But don’t get too comfortable as the correlation could split off one day.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

386,"Oct 2, 2020 10:54AM EDT","2020 has been a banner year for AppleÂ (NASDAQ: AAPL), but that momentum wasn't enough to help the stock in September as shares of the iPhone maker skidded following its stock split at the end of August. The pullback came as the Nasdaq entered a correction in the beginning of September, indicating investors believed tech stocks  had become overvalued. A launch event for a new Apple Watch and iPad later in the month wasn't enough to move the stock higher, and shares finished September down 10%, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.The chart below shows the stock's trajectory for the month.AAPL data by YCharts.Apple came into September at all-time highs, riding a surge at the end of August after announcing a 4-for-1 stock split. However, the split-driven pop quickly evaporated as savvy investors seemed to realize that it didn't actually add any value, even though the stock gained 21% in August in anticipation of the split.Image source: Apple.The euphoria over stock splits by both Apple and TeslaÂ seemed to trigger the sell-off in the Nasdaq in the beginning of September after the tech-heavy index had nearly doubled after bottoming in March. In the following days, Apple shares continued to slide as its feud with Fortnite maker Epic Games reached a fever pitch after Apple booted it from the App Store for refusing to collect its 30% commission on in-app payments. The move underscores what many see as Apple's control over apps as it essentially has a duopoly with Alphabet'sÂ Android.The iPhone maker's big event on Sept. 15, revealing new products and an Apple One bundled subscription, was also greeted with shrugs from the market as the stock fell in each of the three sessions following the event. Over the last week of the month, the stock recouped some of its losses as the market rebounded on hope that Congress would pass another stimulus package.Apple shares could be volatile again this month as the company is expected to unveil its new iPhone 12, its first 5G phone, which some analysts expect to spark a ""supercycle"" of upgrades. The company's fourth-quarter earnings report is also due out at the end of the month. Analysts see revenue falling 0.3% to $63.8 billion, and earnings per share slipping from $0.76 to $0.70.Â 10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

387,"Oct 2, 2020 10:40AM EDT","Shares of electric-car maker Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) fell Friday morning, declining 5% a few minutes into market open. However, by 9:50 a.m. EDT, the stock was down just 3%.The growth stock's decline follows Tesla's report of its third-quarter vehicle deliveries. But shares may be primarily down for another reason, namely bearishness in the overall stock market on Friday.Image source: Getty Images.Tesla announced it had delivered 139,300 vehicles in Q3, beating analysts' average forecast for 137,000 deliveries. This was more than the company has delivered in any other quarter. Highlighting Tesla's impressive growth, the quarter's deliveries were up 43% year over year and 53% sequentially.It's possible that Tesla's quarterly vehicle deliveries were underwhelming to some investors even though they exceeded analysts' average forecast. But what is more certainly weighing on the stock on Friday was a decline in the overall market, spurred by a worse-than-expected jobs report and news last night that President Donald Trump and the first lady had tested positive for the coronavirus.As of this writing, the Nasdaq is down 1.2% and the S&P 500 is down 0.8%.Tesla's better-than-expected third-quarter deliveries puts the company's full-year target for 500,000 deliveries within reach, but it's still not a guarantee. The company will have to deliver more than 181,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter to hit this target.Tesla has been ramping up production and deliveries of both the Model 3 and the Model Y globally. The Model Y's fresh addition to Tesla's vehicle lineup in March will likely play a key role in any sequential growth in Q4.

With a bipartisan deal eluding House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the White House, the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday approved a $2.2 trillion Democratic plan on fiscal aid, but objections from top Republicans are likely to doom the plan in the Senate. Airlines including United Airlines Holding Inc UAL.O, Delta Air Lines Inc DAL.N, JetBlue Airways Corp JBLU.O and American Airlines Group Inc AAL.O fell between 3.1% and 4.2%. Meanwhile, data on Friday showed U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in September as the recovery from the COVID-19 slump shifts into lower gear.

393,"Oct 2, 2020 8:27AM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn Sep. 29, the Seattle City Council passed an ordinance that requires Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) to pay its drivers a minimum hourly wage of $16.39, the same rate required of companies with more than 500 people. This is not good news if you own LYFT stock.I’m sure you’ve heard that before, but let’s dig into why.Of course, Lyft and Uber (NYSE:UBER) are deeply troubled by Seattle’s move to treat its drivers like every other employee in the city. More importantly, it acts as a severe headwind for both companies’ pathways to profitability.Uber and Lyft suggest that drivers in Seattle are primarily working part-time and earning the city median wage. The University of California at Berkley and New York’s New School believe the actual hourly net earnings are under $10 with 33% of its drivers working more than 32 hours per week.Who’s right? As an investor, that’s the wrong question to ask. The right question: Can it make money paying its drivers $16.39 an hour?“The City’s plan is deeply flawed and will actually destroy jobs for thousands of people — as many as 4,000 drivers on Lyft alone — and drive rideshare companies out of Seattle,” Lyft said in a statement.The great thing about capitalism is you have a choice. Lyft doesn’t have to operate in Seattle. If it doesn’t like the rules it has to play under, it’s free to leave.Recently, in my town of Halifax, Nova Scotia, the municipal and provincial governments here made changes to the rules involving ride-hailing so that Lyft and Uber would be incentivized to set up shop in Atlantic Canada’s largest city.The head of the provincial Progressive Conservative Party, the official opposition to the governing Liberal Party, believes most Nova Scotians welcome the changes.“Services like Uber, Lyft and home grown services like Prince Edward Island start up Kari / RedRide, will provide a safe affordable way to move about, particularly in rural Nova Scotia while empowering properly vetted and licensed drivers to use their vehicle and time to make extra money,” Houston said.My wife and I moved from Toronto almost three years ago. We’ve been patiently waiting for Lyft and Uber to come here.So, while the minimum wage in Nova Scotia is only 12.55 Canadian dollars ($9.38), 43% less than Seattle’s wage, the population is 412,674. Seattle’s population is approximately 10 times larger.Lyft will probably come here, but the opportunity to make a buck won’t be nearly as high as it is in Seattle and the surrounding suburbs.The reality is that in most cities across North America, the hourly minimum wage will continue to move higher. Here in Nova Scotia, the minimum hourly wage is scheduled to increase to 13.10 CAD ($9.79) on April 1, 2021, incrementally after that based on the consumer price index (CPI). It’s not going the other way.As an investor, you have to decide if economies of scale are enough to deliver future profits despite the reality staring you in the face.Maybe. Maybe not.Lyft reported its second-quarter results in mid-August. On the top line, sales were $339.4 million, 61% lower than a year earlier due to the novel coronavirus. On the bottom line, Lyft lost $437.1 million during the quarter, a 32.2% improvement from its $644.2 million loss a year ago.InvestorPlace’s Robert Lakin reported in early September that the company’s trips in August rose 7.3% over those in July. Lyft announced that its third-quarter adjusted EBITDA loss should be no higher than $265 million. In Q3 2019, its adjusted EBITDA loss was $128.1 million.In Q3 2019 it had 22.3 million active riders, a 28% increase over a year earlier. In the second quarter of 2020, that number was 8.7 million, 60% down from Q2 2019.So, based on the numbers above, it lost approximately $5.74 per active rider in Q3 2019. In Q2 2020, its adjusted EBITDA loss was $280.3 million or $32.22 per active rider.Assuming the number of active riders in the third quarter is halfway between Q3 2019 (22.3 million) and Q2 2020 (8.7 million), we’re looking at 15.5 million. Based on its projected loss of $265 million, that’s a loss per active rider of $17.10.From an investment standpoint, before Covid, Lyft was generating $42.82 in revenue per active rider and losing $5.74 from this same active rider, which means in the third quarter of 2019, it was spending $48.56 per active rider — and that was relatively speaking a healthy quarter.Now, factor in the rising minimum wage across North America, and it seems unlikely that Lyft will reach profitability anytime soon.In late July, I recommended that anyone interested in LYFT stock instead buy some Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Lyft is down 9% in the two months since Tesla’s up 40% in the same period. In April, I said Lyft was a good bet for aggressive investors only, so I wouldn’t say it’s totally uninvestable.That said, I continue to believe TSLA is a far better stock to own over the long haul, not the least of which is the fact the minimum wage isn’t nearly as big an overhang for Elon Musk.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. Will Ashworth has written about investments full-time since 2008.

396,"Oct 2, 2020 8:06AM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt was a bumpy September for many investors. But with the market now sporting an even larger correction, are shares of Alteryx (NYSE:AYX) in position for buying? Let’s see what’s happening off and on the price chart of AYX stock, then offer a risk-adjusted determination in alignment with those findings. The market-leading Nasdaq Composite took a bit of a header this past month. The index sank 13% at its worst and finished down 5% for the period. Still, don’t feel too bad for its investors. On the back of fantastic gains in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and other valuation influencers, the bellwether is also up 25% year-to-date.The large-cap, tech-heavy index has also climbed 67% since the worst of the coronavirus’ impact on Wall Street in late March.The same good fortune hasn’t been bestowed on AYX investors though.To be fair, the software-as-a-service (SaaS) data science and analytics outfit is up 17% in 2020 and just over 50% since its associated Covid-19 low struck on March 17. Gains of that size aren’t historically the kind to take for granted. But it hasn’t exactly been an ordinary year either, right? As well, conditions were much rosier not so long ago for AYX’s shareholders.At its July high, Alteryx was up 85% on the year and nearly 150% removed from the lows of the stock’s coronavirus-driven bear market. So, what went wrong and why has Alteryx shed 38% since its peak valuation which promisingly placed shares into the sphere of large-cap tech stocks?September’s notorious bearish seasonality, which did come to fruition this year, is one thing. But that pressure only prompted a monthly decline of 6% in AYX stock. The rest of Alteryx’s overall correction has been tied to investor concerns over substantial deceleration in near-term sales growth. Back in early August, Alteryx’s management cut its revenue outlook well below Street forecasts.Citing longer customer sales cycles spurred by reduced spending amid the pandemic, AYX’s track record of consistent mid-to-high double-digit sales gains ended abruptly. And in turn, shares well-positioned for the bearish consequences, bowed to that reality. Overly optimistic growth assumptions, dancing around profitability, a nosebleed sales multiple and pricing today which would still would make a value investor shudder, it’s not entirely surprising Alteryx has been welcomed firmly back into the mid-cap camp.
Source: Charts by TradingViewThe big question for AYX investors is if the company’s business can reassert some of its former glory in 2021 and beyond. There are no guarantees, but many analysts are upbeat on its longer-term prospects. A nearby move into a cloud-based product for its core platform confirmed during at earnings is a promising step towards that end.Today though, and despite the sell-off of the past couple months, AYX remains expensive-looking. There’s no two ways around a forward P/E of 119 and multiple which values shares a full 15.5x sales. As such, waiting for a stronger pullback has proven to be popular advice among investors with an eye on a future. But will the recommendation prove prescient?The other thing(s) investors might consider is the ability for select growth stocks to remain richly valued. That includes stocks like Alteryx, which hit a quarterly bump in the road. The narrative turns cautious, but traditional metrics remain rich. Also (and specific to AYX right now), waiting on the sidelines turns a blind eye to Alteryx’s decent technical-based value proposition on the price chart.Currently, shares have confirmed a bottoming weekly candlestick pattern inside a layered Fibonacci support zone. The formation continues to hold longer-term uptrend support and is backed by a bullish oversold crossover stochastics signal. And with stocks purported to be forward-looking pricing mechanisms, the opportunity to use a hedged AYX stock collar strategy (where you own stock, then buy puts and sell calls) which helps work around today’s valuation concerns, while still being in it to win it, is worthy of consideration.No stocks owned: On the date of publication, Chris Tyler did not hold, directly or indirectly, positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.Chris Tyler is a former floor-based, derivatives market maker on the American and Pacific exchanges.

397,"Oct 2, 2020 8:00AM EDT","[9/30/2020] Can Nikola’s Troubles Benefit Nio Stock Shares of Chinese premium electric vehicle (EV) company Nio (NYSE:NIO) jumped by over 15% over the last two trading days, driven partly by a positive report from Deutsche Bank, which raised revenue and earnings forecasts and expressed optimism surrounding the company’s technology and brand recognition in China. Apart from this, there could be another factor driving the interest in Nio stock.Electric vehicle stocks have been in high demand this year, but there are few viable ways to play the space. EV bellwether Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) looks good but is richly valued, with its stock rising almost 5x year-to-date with a market cap of roughly $400 billion. On the other hand electric truck startup, Nikola, has come under fire for misleading investors about its technology and capabilities and is now the subject of investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC. Investors could stay on the sidelines until the company delivers a product. Nio, which trades at a relatively reasonable 7.5x consensus 2021 revenues, is looking like a decent pick for investors who want to play the EV space without overpaying or betting on unproven companies. Nio’s Revenue is likely to grow by over 90% in 2020 and by about 70% in 2021, per consensus data.Want exposure to the growing electric vehicle market, without having to bet on individual brands? Check out our indicative theme of Electric Vehicle Component Suppliers which includes names such as Amphenol Corporation (APH), TE Connectivity (TEL), BorgWarner (BWA), and others.[8/26/2020] Nio Stock Continues To Surge AheadThe stock price for Nio (NYSE: NIO), a Chinese premium electric vehicle (EV) start-up, continues to surge rising by 19% on Tuesday. The stock is up by about 50% over the last month alone. The recent gains are driven by a couple of factors. Firstly, UBS analysts upgraded the stock, raising their price target dramatically from around $1 per share to $16. Secondly, the company also indicated that it intends to enter new markets, beginning with Europe, starting from the second half of 2021. Nio also launched a new “battery as a service” offering, which reduces the upfront cost of a vehicle by selling the EV without a battery and making users pay for batteries monthly (roughly $140 per month), much like they would for gasoline on an internal combustion engine car. Users can swap out depleted batteries for fully charged ones within a few minutes, across 143 battery swap stations in 64 cities in China.Nio stock is up over 4.5x this year. How does its valuation compare with other EV makers? Is it overvalued? Now Nio’s $21 billion market cap implies that it is trading at about 6x consensus 2021 revenues of about $3.6 billion. In comparison, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is valued at $375 billion, or about 7x consensus 2021 revenue of about $41 billion, while Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA), an electric truck startup is valued at $15 billion despite the fact that it has yet to start commercial production. Looking at the relative valuation, Nio seems fairly priced considering its stronger near-term growth prospects.Is Nio stock a better investment than EV bellwether Tesla? Find out more in our dashboard analysis How Does Nio Compare With Tesla?[7/27/2020] Some Recent Updates On Nio StockChinese premium electric vehicle (EV) start-up Nio has seen its stock rally by about 50% in July, driven by strong Q2 delivery figures and a general increase in demand for stocks of EV companies. Below, we take a look at some of the recent developments for NIO.In early July, NIO published its second-quarter delivery report, indicating that it delivered 10,331 vehicles, marking an increase of 191% year-over-year and about 169% sequentially. The company has benefited from pent-up demand post the Covid-19 related lockdowns, and its total deliveries for the first half of the year now stand at 14,169 cars.Last week, the company provided more details on its EC6 crossover SUV, noting that it would be priced at RMB 368,000 (about $53,000) before subsidies. The vehicle, which is a coupe-style version of the ES6 mid-sized SUV, will start deliveries this September. However, it will be interesting to see how it fares when Tesla launches the Model Y compact SUV in China in early 2021. While pricing for the made in China Model Y isn’t known yet, we think it’s likely that it will undercut the EC6. For instance, the Model 3 sedan sells for about $41,000 before subsidies in China and the Model Y in the U.S. costs about $4,000 more than the Model 3, indicating that a price of under $50,000 for the base model is quite likely.Nio also secured credit lines with six Chinese banks for a total of RMB 10.4 billion (about $1.5 billion) this month. This is a very positive development for the company, considering that it began 2020 with a precariously low cash position. Since then, the company raised over $ 1 billion from Chinese government agencies while also seeing some capital infusion from early investor Tencent Holdings. With the new credit lines, the company should have adequate liquidity to execute on its plans and launch new models.Is Nio stock a better investment than EV bellwether Tesla?

The company hit its much-anticipated fourth consecutive quarter of profitability and announced a much-ballyhooed 5-for-1 stock split. Shares have gained more than 400% so far this year, but a look under the hood suggests there's still a long drive ahead.Revenue of $6.04 billion in the second quarter of 2020 declined 5% year over year, and it was sales of government-issued energy credits for producing zero-emission vehicles -- which amounted to $428 million -- that provided all the profits for the second quarter.Â Don't get me wrong: I'm a happy Tesla shareholder, but I also recognize that the risky company -- along with its outspoken founder, Elon Musk -- might not be everyone's cup of tea. Given the relatively low bar set by its financial performance, there are plenty of other stocks out there with revenue that is growing much faster than the electric-vehicle maker's, while also offering fantastic long-term opportunities. Here are three worth considering.Image source: Getty Images.With the pandemic as a backdrop, it's easy to understand why patients would be turning in droves to telemedicine options, which lets them see a healthcare professional via a secure videoconferencing app without ever leaving their home. The industry was already emerging at a brisk pace, but fears of contracting the coronavirus shifted that growth into overdrive. As the global leader in virtual care, Teladoc Health (NYSE: TDOC) was well-positioned to benefit from the trend.For 2019, Teladoc's revenue grew to $553 million, up 32% year over year, while its losses improved. At the same time, its total patient visits jumped 57% to 4.1 million.Â Fast-forward to 2020, and its business has grown exponentially. Just in the first six months of this year, revenue grew 63% to $422 million, and Teladoc continues to edge closer to profitability. Even more impressive was its number of total patient visits, which soared 144% to 4.8 million -- more than all of last year.Â Once patients have experienced the ease and convenience of a telehealth visit, they'll likely stick with it. A recent survey of 1,800 patients polled by Doctor.com found that half of the respondents had used telehealth over the past three months, and 71% said they would use it today. In addition, 83% of the patients said they would continue to use telehealth even after the pandemic fades.Â Image source: Getty Images.When investors think of Square (NYSE: SQ), they no doubt picture the company's namesake payments dongle that plugged into mobile devices, enabling a whole generation of small businesses. That pocket-sized device provided the foundation for what has grown into a fast-growing payments empire.Cash App, the company's peer-to-peer payment app, is a small but growing part of Square's business, eliciting no fewer than 70 mentions in the company's second-quarter shareholder letter. Cash App registered more than 30 million monthly users, with 7 million using the optional Cash Card in June, double the amount in the previous-year period.This is important because the app acts as a gateway to the full range of Square's portfolio of products and services, which includes Cash App, Cash Card, Boost, direct deposit, and even bitcoin investing. Customers that use two or more products have a higher lifetime value, generating two to three times as much revenue as those that merely stick with the Cash App.Â The stickiness of its ecosystem is working. Second-quarter revenue of $1.92 billion jumped 64% year over year. While its gross payment volume (GPV) slipped 15% due to the pandemic, Cash App was the headliner, delivering revenue of $1.2 billion, soaring 361% year over year, while gross profit of $281 million increased 167%. Customer transactions increased to 15 per month, on average, an increase of nearly 50%.The combination of accelerating customer acquisition, expanding product adoption, and growing frequency of use all point to Cash App driving Square's business for years to come.Image source: Getty Images.Similar to the greater adoption of digital payment apps and telehealth solutions, cloud computing -- which was already experiencing robust growth prior to the pandemic -- shifted into overdrive this year. With more and more business being conducted in the cloud, a company's ongoing success often depends on the smooth operation of its websites and apps.That's where Datadog (NASDAQ: DDOG) comes in. The software-as-a-service (SaaS) company provides real-time analytics and monitoring services that help ensure companies are putting their best foot forward, digitally speaking, and that their cloud-based operations continue without a hitch.That's not all. In addition to monitoring servers, databases, tools, and services, the artificial intelligence algorithms can spot anomalies and predict failures, and notify customers before they go critical, resulting in costly outages.Customers are clamoring for the security Datadog provides. In the second quarter, revenue grew 68% year over year to $140 million and the company also generated its second consecutive quarterly profit, a rarity among high-tech companies that are only about a year old.Â Datadog's rapidly growing customer base is a key component of its success, up 37% year over year. Even more impressive was the increase of enterprise customers contributing in excess of $100,000, which grew to 1,015, up 71%. At the same time, existing customers are spending significantly more, as evidenced by its dollar-based retention rate of 130% -- meaning existing clients are spending 30% more now than they did a year ago.The company was already thriving prior to the pandemic, but accelerating adoption of the cloud has kicked that into overdrive.Data by YChartsThese companies all share a common trait: they are high-risk, high-reward investments, similar to Tesla. Thus, it isn't surprising that they don't necessarily come cheap. Datadog, Teladoc, and Square are selling at 54, 18, and 10 times forward sales, respectively -- when a good price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is between 1 and 2.Additionally, only Datadog is profitable. Each of these highfliers is spending heavily to increase its market share, as the lifetime value of each new customer easily outstrips the current cost of acquisition.That said, with solid top-line growth rates and fantastic long-term opportunities, each of these companies would be a good choice if Tesla isn't right for you -- or even if it is.10 stocks we like better than Teladoc HealthWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.
