1,"Oct 8, 2020 9:00AM EDT","""Tesla hasn't responded to a press inquiry in months."" Tuesday's column by professional Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) watcher Electrek opened with what sounded like a complaint -- but was really more of an observation. Citing sources from ""the highest level"" who ""can confirm"" this fact, Electrek proceeded to report that Tesla has officially ""dissolved its PR department,"" and now literally has nobody on staff responding to inquiries from the press.Image source: Getty Images.In part, Tesla's move appears to have happened by accident, but in part, it happened by design. As Electrek notes, former Tesla PR head Keely Sulprizio left Tesla to join the staff at Impossible Foods in December 2019, and senior global communications manager Danielle Meister departed for WhatsApp in April.Other folks who previously handled press inquiries have shifted into new roles within Tesla itself. Senior manager Gina Antonini, for example, is now Tesla's director of external relations and employee experience. Former communications manager Alexander Ingram now works for Tesla's design studio, and PR staffer Rich Otto has become a product manager. Another communications alumnus, Alan Cooper, first switched departments in February -- then left the company entirely.Still, you'd think that if Tesla were interested in talking to the press, it would have little difficulty finding replacements -- but apparently, Tesla is in fact not interested. Electrek notes that Tesla CEO Elon Musk complains often about Tesla's treatment in the press. Now, it appears he's decided to simply cut off contact with the media entirely.So how people supposed to ask Tesla questions when they have them nowadays? Well, according to the website at least, Tesla still has an email address for press inquiries: Press@Tesla.com, and a separate address for investor queries: IR@Tesla.com.If you've ever got questions for Tesla, drop them a line. And cross your fingers.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

3,"Oct 8, 2020 7:04AM EDT","Value traps are companies that may seem cheap at first glance, but get progressively cheaper and cheaper until their stock destroys all the wealth investors can put into them. Such phenomena are quite common for companies that enduring considerable declines in their core operations, or are cooking their books to make their business look more attractive. From a company that fabricated its financials, to another that's embroiled in insider trading controversy, to another that faces allegations that its technology is non-existent, the stocks all have one thing in common: having fallen from great heights and appearing deceptively undervalued. Let's look at why these companies are value traps and why investors should avoid them. Image source: Getty Images.Luckin Coffee (OTC: LKNC.Y) had high hopes of disrupting the Chinese coffee industry. Founded in 2017, the company began on a journey of rapid expansion across China, opening nearly 5,000 stores across the country by the end of 2019, eclipsing Starbucks' goal of opening 6,000 stores in the Middle Kingdom by the end of 2022. However, that dream came crashing down in April as an internal review of its financials found its COO had fabricated at least $310 million of its $732 million in revenue last year. In addition, short-seller Muddy Waters conducted an independent investigation of the company that found it relied on mass distribution of free coffee coupons for the sake of growth. At one point in time, Luckin Coffee allegedly gave nearly half of its coffee for free to solicit new customers, while its core members received no such perks for their loyalty. The Nasdaq stock exchange has delisted the stock for failing to file its financial statements since the third quarter of 2019. Since its all-time high in April, the stock is now down over 90%. For investors who find it tempting to buy the dip, however, there are many reasons to stay away from the stock. Most crucially, it is simply not the cultural norm for people to drink coffee in China, where the average Chinese person only drinks 0.014 cups of coffee per day. That's astonishingly low compared to the 1.1 cups of coffee the average American drinks on a daily basis. Keep in mind, the reason behind the company fabricating its financials was to ""demonstrate"" that it had the potential to outcompete Starbucks. Now that the house of cards has come crumbling down, it is difficult to see how Luckin coffee can generate genuine consumer traffic at thousands of its stores. With so many players in a hypercompetitive market, the worst is probably yet to come for Luckin coffee. In late July, shares of digital camera company Eastman Kodak (NYSE: KODK) looked like they were finally about to turn around seven years of underperformance, with the announcement that the Department of Defense (DoD) will be awarding the company a $765 million loan for it to manufacture generic drug ingredients. Fast forward three months later, and Kodak stock is once again going through tough times, after allegations of rampant insider trading in anticipation of the deal announcement and questionable tax avoidance tactics by one of its board members forced the DoD to halt the deal. In September, a law firm hired by Kodak cleared the company of any wrongdoing, which ironically brings up a new problem of conflict of interest rather than inspire confidence. The company is still pending outcomes of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Even if the company miraculously gets the loan back, take note that it's still a loan as opposed to an equity investment. The generic drug sector is already highly saturated as it is. Suppose Kodak invests hundreds of millions in new manufacturing facilities and sees little return on investment. In that case, it has little chance of paying back the DoD, as a $765 million debt is almost 64 times the size of Kodak's annual cash flow. Unfortunately, the advent of smartphones is rapidly rendering digital cameras archaic, as well as squeezing out traditional photo printing services. During the second quarter of 2020, Eastman Kodak's revenue decreased from $307 million in second quarter 2019 to $213 million, while its non-cash operating loss (EBITDA) increased from $1 million to $7 million over the same time period. The stock is now down nearly 85% from its high of $60 per share in July. At one point in time, electric car company Nikola's (NASDAQ: NKLA) market cap soared to as much as $34 billion after it disclosed that it discovered a breakthrough in vehicle battery technology. Unlike its competitor Tesla Motors, however, Nikola did not disclose the chemical composition of its supposed battery, nor any information about which university it partnered with to develop the technology. With the help of short-selling firm Hindenburg Research digging through some financials in September, it turned out that Nikola made its breakthrough claim days before it signed a letter-of-intent to acquire car battery start-up ZapGo, who in turn boasted that they had developed a groundbreaking carbon-ion battery that is significantly more energy efficient than commercially available variants. Before the acquisition could go through, ZapGo's President of U.S. Operations resigned over prostitution and tax fraud allegations. The two companies are now embroiled in a lawsuit with Nikola alleging ZapGo made false or misleading statements regarding its technology. ZapGo took the initial steps to declaring insolvency in July, which is highly uncanny for a company possessing a major technological advancement. We will not know for sure until after the fact whether or not Nikola actually has the capacity to deliver its promise on a revolutionary battery. The odds, however, are not good. According to General Motors employees who have witnessed Nikola's operations, the company's battery and fuel technology were inferior to that of General Motors'. Both the SEC and the Department of Justice are investing allegations of misconduct against Nikola. If drowning in controversy isn't enough, Nikola's financials are also nothing to be excited about. In the second quarter of 2020, the company generated just $36k in revenue, compared to a stunning net loss of $100 million. That's mind-boggling for a company with a market cap of $9 billion. In just four months, shares are down over 70% from its high in June. 10 stocks we like better than Eastman KodakWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

4,"Oct 8, 2020 6:19AM EDT","After both Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) split their stocks last month, investors rightly wondered whether another high-flying stock, Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN), would also split its shares.After all, with its shares at over $3,100 apiece, now would seem an opportune time to jump on the bandwagon. But I don't think Amazon will. Despite having split its shares three times in the past, the situation today is much different, and it appears Amazon is happy to remain a high-priced stock.Image source: Amazon.com.It's been more than 20 years since Amazon divvied its shares to make them more attractive to investors, and the e-commerce giant was still relatively new to the public markets back then.Amazon's initial public offering was in May 1997. A year later, the company split its stock 2-for-1, when it was trading at only $85 per share and it had a market cap of less than $5 billion. Just seven months later, it split again 3-for-1, after the shares had rocketed to $355 a piece. Eight months after that, in September 1999, it split for the third and last time, 2-for-1, when the stock was trading under $120 each.Since then, Amazon has been on an astronomical tear. In the 21 years that followed, the stock has risen by more than 5,200%, compared with a 158% gain for the S&P 500. And its market cap has increased from $20 billion to almost $1.6 trillion, a 7,800% expansion, for a compounded annual growth rate of 23%.AMZN data by YChartsAn investor would be hard put to find a better performing stock, yet over the past two decades as Amazon's business has both grown and improved, and its stock continued to climb into the stratosphere, the e-commerce giant has chosen not to split its stock again.Amazon was a much different company the last time it split its stock. Still primarily the ""world's biggest bookseller,"" in 1999 Amazon had only recently expanded into selling music CDs, and it was just adding a few more categories to its selection, including, toys, electronics, and tools. By December of that year, the e-commerce company had shipped a total of 20 million items,  and it generated total revenue of just over $1.6 billion.To put that into perspective, during its annual Prime Day shopping extravaganza event last year, Amazon sold over 175 million products. For the full year, Amazon had $280.5 billion in sales, meaning it took just the first two days of 2019 for its revenue to match the entire year's worth of sales in 1999. Of course, the Amazon of today is more than just books, toys, electronics, or tools, and you can find just about anything you want to buy on the website.But it's also just more than about e-commerce. While shipping its products keeps the U.S. Postal Service operational, Amazon Web Services (AWS) generated $35 billion in sales, or about 12% of the total, yet represented 63% of Amazon's $14.5 billion in operating profit.AWS has become the backbone for the online platforms of numerous other retailers and businesses, including the U.S. government. It controls a market-leading 31% share of cloud services, followed by Microsoft Azure at 20%, Alphabet's Google Cloud with 6%, and Alibaba at 5%.Amazon also has its own fleet of delivery cars and vans, its own fleet of airplanes and trucks, even container ships. It also operates more than 175 operating fulfillment centers and more than 150 million square feet of space to ship products.Because Amazon encompasses far more than simply a consumer-facing business, even if that's what it's most recognized as, it doesn't need to make itself accessible to retail investors anymore.In 1999, Amazon was trying to make its mark against Barnes & Noble, but today it's involved in almost every segment of the economy. Its products and services are literally almost too numerous to mention, which means it can be complacent about being available only to most retail investors as a fractional investment through services like Robinhood and WeBull.A split doesn't really matter to an investor anyway, as that investor's stake in the company remains the same. It all depends upon whether you like your pizza cut into eight slices or 16 -- it doesn't change the size of your pie.Still, after 20 years and thousands of percentage-point increases later, it's safe to say Amazon.com won't be splitting its stock anytime soon -- though that doesn't mean its stock isn't still a buy.10 stocks we like better than AmazonWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

5,"Oct 8, 2020 5:51AM EDT","Investing in 2020 has been an adventure. In a roughly six-month span, the widely followed S&P 500 lost over a third of its value, clawed everything back, and even gained. It was the steepest 30%-plus bear market decline we've ever seen, as well as the quickest rebound to new highs from a bear market bottom in history.Besides giving long-term investors opportunities to scoop up great companies at bargain prices, this heightened volatility has also lured millennial and/or novice investors into equities. Online investing app Robinhood, which is best known for its commission-free trades and gifts of stock shares to new members, has signed up millions of people. The average age of these new short-term-focused traders is 31. Unfortunately, not all of the companies that Robinhood investors flock to are Wall Street favorites. Wall Street hates the following three stocks that you can find among Robinhood's top 50 holdings.Image source: Getty Images.It's no secret that millennial investors are enamored with electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers, and none is more popular than Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). Robinhood's investors are known to chase momentum stocks. Since Tesla was recently up over 1,000% on a trailing-12-month basis at one point, it fits the profile.Yet Tesla isn't that well-liked on Wall Street. Keeping in mind that underperform and sell ratings are rare (often because investment banks don't want to burn bridges with the companies they're rating), September featured eight strong buy or buy ratings, 15 hold ratings, and 10 underperform or sell-equivalent ratings. Put another way, fewer than 1 in 4 Wall Street analysts views Tesla as a stock to buy right now.Why the skepticism? One reason might be Tesla's lack of a full-year generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profit. Tesla has often leaned on EV credit to bolster its adjusted profitability, but hasn't been able to generate a full-year GAAP profit. That's a bit worrisome for a company valued at almost $400 billion.Tesla's valuation is also a tough pill to swallow. Putting aside its triple-digit forward price-to-earnings ratio for a moment, Tesla is on track to deliver roughly 500,000 EVs in 2020. Comparatively, other major auto stocks are producing anywhere from 3 million to 8 million vehicles annually. Tesla's valuation is nearly equal to many of the largest traditional automakers put together, yet it remains unprofitable on a full-year GAAP basis.Tesla is a stock I wouldn't buy because I also question the sustainability of its competitive advantages. Tesla has certainly benefited from its first-mover advantage in mass-produced EVs and its battery range. But it's not going to be the only show in town. General Motors, Ford, and pretty much every major automaker is tossing billions (or tens of billions) of dollars at EVs and autonomous vehicles in the coming years. I'd say Wall Street is right to question Tesla's valuation here.Image source: Getty Images.Millennial and novice investors are also gung-ho on marijuana stocks, with Canadian licensed producer Aurora Cannabis (NYSE: ACB) once holding the title of most-held stock on the entire Robinhood platform.However, there's been a pretty clear bifurcation on favorability when it comes to North American pot stocks. Weed companies in the U.S. are thriving, while our neighbors to the north are struggling badly. That's meant little love for Aurora Cannabis. According to Robinhood, only 17% of analysts currently have a buy rating on Aurora, with 78% at hold and 6% at the equivalent of a sell rating.It's certainly not hard to see why Wall Street is skeptical of the company. Since mid-March 2019, Aurora Cannabis' stock has lost more than 96% of its value. Once expected to lead North America in marijuana output, Aurora has closed five of its smaller cultivation farms, halted production on its two largest projects to conserve capital, and sold its greenhouse in Exeter, Ontario, which it never retrofit for cannabis production. Though Aurora is selling more cannabis of late, its value brands are dominating those sales, which means operating margins are hurting.Though at least some of Canada's shortcomings can be blamed on regulatory issues, problems specific to Aurora deserve a wag of the finger from investors. The company has been issuing stock in droves to raise capital for funding acquisitions and day-to-day operations. In six years, Aurora's reverse-split-adjusted share count has ballooned from 1.3 million to 115.2 million, meaning it's constantly diluting existing shareholders.Aurora also grossly overpaid for each and every one of its acquisitions since August 2016. In fiscal 2020, the company wrote down well over $2 billion Canadian in goodwill and intangible assets tied to these deals.Aurora Cannabis has shown little to inspire confidence and should be avoided.Image source: Getty Images.Robinhood investors are also fans of Big Oil. Integrated oil and gas giant ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) is a top-50 holding on the platform that Wall Street doesn't exactly love.In September, 25 Wall Street analysts had a rating issued on the company, with two calling it a strong buy, 18 labeling it a hold, and five designating the company an underperform or sell. That's less than 10% of Wall Street investment banks believing ExxonMobil was worth buying as of last month.Why no love for ExxonMobil? In the short run, the company is contending with a historic plunge in crude oil demand tied to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Although economic activity is rising, there's no way for any developed economy to fully step on the gas until there's a workable vaccine. This means continued pressure and potential oversupply on crude demand for the foreseeable future.The other problem is the continued push toward renewable energy sources in developed countries. Make no mistake, oil isn't going away anytime soon -- but the developed world's reliance on fossil fuels may begin to wane, putting ExxonMobil's future growth prospects into doubt.For what it's worth, ExxonMobil is the only one of these three hated stocks that I believe is worth buying. As an integrated company, it's able to lean on its downstream refining and petrochemical operations when crude prices weaken. It also has ample production opportunities overseas to meet developed and emerging market demand.This is the first time in 35 years that ExxonMobil has been so cheap relative to its book value. In my view, this makes it a compelling buy at its current price.10 stocks we like better than ExxonMobilWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

6,"Oct 8, 2020 4:02AM EDT","Vehicle leasing could represent a large and lucrative opportunity for Tesla in the long-run. Just about 1 in 20 Teslas delivered in Q2 2020 were leased, compared to about 1 in 4 vehicles in the U.S. which are leased, giving the company a lot of room to scale up. Teslaâs leases are also likely to be more lucrative for the company, as its leases are more expensive compared to rivals, and the companyâs vehicles also hold higher residual value. Below is a bit more about where Teslaâs leasing business stands and how it impacts Teslaâs financials. View our interactive dashboard analysis How Teslaâs Expanding Leasing Business Reflects On Its FinancialsTeslaâs Leasing BusinessLeases help to bring down the upfront cost of owning a vehicle and come with tax benefits. Monthly lease payments are also typically lower than loan payments.Â  Teslaâs Lease Sales as % of Vehicle Deliveries have grown from 3% in Q3â18 to over 9% in Q3â19, as Model 3 was added to the companyâs leasing program. However, the number declined to about 5% as of Q2 2020, likely due to lower interest rates which could be making people opt for financing over leasing. That said, if interest rates remain low, Tesla could cut lease rates, making its leasing program more attractive. The recent addition of the Model Y SUV to Teslaâs leasing program could also help Tesla lease more vehicles.How Leases Impact Teslaâs Automotive RevenuesTesla only recognizes the monthly operating lease payments when it leases a vehicle, versus recognizing the full selling price for vehicles that are financed or bought outright. However, lease revenues are much more stable, as they include payments from vehicles leased in prior periods as well. Teslaâs Lease Revenues grew about 30% year-over-year to about $268 million in Q2â20, despite the fact that the number of leased vehicles over the quarter declined. Tesla had about 55k vehicles under lease as of Q2â20, up from 39k vehicles in the year-ago quarter. How Leases Impact Teslaâs MarginsTeslaâs Gross Margins for Leases stood at 45%, well ahead of Automotive Sales Gross Margins of 24% in Q2 2020. Gross Margins for leases are higher likely due to the fact that Tesla keeps the vehicles on its balance sheet with the Cost of Sales on leases primarily relating to the depreciation of the leased asset. Itâs possible that some expenses are being excluded compared to outright sales, which account for all manufacturing-related costs.Teslaâs Electric Vehicles Are Great For LeasingResidual values on Teslas hold up far better than other vehicles. For example, per data from iSeeCars, a Tesla Model 3 lost just about 5% of its value within one year, versus about 14% for a Honda Accord and a whopping 38% for a BMW 3 Series. A similar trend can be seen if we compare the Model S and X with competing luxury vehicles. This means that at the end of a lease, Tesla still has a valuable asset that can be sold or used for the companyâs planned Robo taxi fleet. This is likely due to the lower wear and tear associated with electric vehicles, Teslaâs periodic software updates â which keep adding features, and the low running costs. The higher residuals and longer life could also give Tesla the flexibility to cut lease payments further, making it more attractive to customers.What if youâre looking for a more balanced portfolio instead? Hereâs aÂ high-quality portfolio to beat the market, with over 100% return since 2016, versus 50% for the S&P 500. Comprised of companies with strong revenue growth, healthy profits, lots of cash, and low risk, it has outperformed the broader market year after year, consistently.See allÂ Trefis Price EstimatesÂ andÂ DownloadÂ Trefis DataÂ hereWhatâs behind Trefis?

7,"Oct 7, 2020 9:29PM EDT","Oct 7 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Wednesday the company will produce Model Y with a new structural battery design and technology at its Berlin factory next year and that could result in a ""significant production risk"".The U.S. electric carmaker plans to manufacture a new version of its Model Y crossover vehicle, and possibly even battery cells at the site. Last month, Musk said that Tesla will use its Germany-based plant to demonstrate a radical overhaul of how its cars are built. The company plans to start the production of Model Y at Gigafactory Berlin during the second half of 2021.Tesla's new battery cell - a larger cylindrical format called 4680 that can store more energy and is easier to make - is key to achieving the goal of cutting battery costs in half and ramping up battery production nearly 100-fold by 2030.The company's new structural battery pack requires the new 4680 battery cells in order to work.Musk said on Wednesday that it will take about two years for  Tesla factories in Fremont and Shanghai to embrace the new technology.""Fremont and Shanghai will transition in 2 years when new tech is proven,"" Musk said in a tweet.The company said last week that it delivered 139,300 vehicles in the third quarter, a quarterly record for the electric carmaker. Tesla's delivery push has been supported by its new Shanghai factory, the only plant currently producing vehicles outside California, as it is also building a new vehicle and battery manufacturing facility near Berlin.(Reporting by Sabahatjahan Contractor and Kanishka Singh in Bengaluru, Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips)((Sabahatjahan.Contractor@thomsonreuters.com; within U.S. +1 646 223 8780 outside the U.S.  +918067492635;))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/musk-says-tesla-to-use-new-batteries-tech-at-berlin-factory-flags-production-risk-2020-10

8,"Oct 7, 2020 5:57PM EDT","By Paul LienertOct 7 (Reuters) - Tesla co-founder J.B. Straubel wants to build his startup Redwood Materials into the world's top battery recycling company and one of the largest battery materials companies, he said at a technology conference Wednesday.Straubel aims to leverage two partnerships, one with Panasonic Corp 6752.T, the Japanese battery manufacturer that is teamed with Tesla TSLA.O at the Nevada gigafactory, and one announced weeks ago with e-commerce giant Amazon AMZN.O.With production of electric vehicles and batteries about to explode, Straubel says his ultimate goal is to ""make a material impact on sustainability, at an industrial scale.""Established in early 2017, Redwood this year will recycle more than 1 terawatt-hours' worth of battery scrap materials from the gigafactory — enough to power more than 10,000 Tesla cars.That is a fraction of the half-million vehicles Tesla expects to build this year. At the company's Battery Day in late September, Chief Executive Elon Musk said he was looking at recycling batteries to supplement the supply of raw materials from mining as Tesla escalates vehicle production.Redwood's partnership with Panasonic started late last year with a pilot operation to recover materials at Redwood's recycling facilities in nearby Carson City, according to Celina Mikolajczak, vice president of battery technology at Panasonic Energy of North America.Mikolajczak, who spent six years at Tesla as a battery technology leader, said: ""People underestimate what recycling can do for the electric vehicles industry. This could have a huge impact on raw material prices and output in the future.”Straubel's broader plan is to dramatically reduce mining of raw materials such as nickel, copper and cobalt over several decades by building out a circular or “closed loop” supply chain that recycles and recirculates materials retrieved from end-of-life vehicle and grid storage batteries and from cells scrapped during manufacturing.In September, Redwood said it received funding from Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, following an investment by Breakthrough Energy Ventures, backed by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Microsoft founder Bill Gates.“I’m excited about the work we can do together,” Straubel said of Amazon. “They have batteries in many devices,” from consumer electronics to data centers, as well as future electric delivery vehicles and drones.(Reporting by Paul Lienert in Detroit; Editing by David Gregorio)((Paul.Lienert@thomsonreuters.com; mobile +1 313-670-2452;))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ex-tesla-exec-straubel-aims-to-build-worlds-top-battery-recycler-2020-10-07

10,"Oct 7, 2020 2:13PM EDT","Another day -- another great day for investors in the renewable energy sector. In midday trading Wednesday, shares of hydrogen producers and fuel-cell manufacturers Plug Power (NASDAQ: PLUG) and Bloom Energy (NYSE: BE) are climbing 10.2% and 12.4%, respectively, as of 12:10 p.m. EDT. At the same time, shares of lithium miner Piedmont Lithium (NASDAQ: PLL) are enjoying a 6.7% gain.The question is: Why?Image source: Getty Images.There's no news out on the wires about any of these three alternative energy stocks. No upgrades, no price target hikes -- and certainly nothing of substance from the companies themselves that would explain share-price spikes of roughly 7%, 10%, and even 12%! And yet, the broad themes in renewable energy that are supporting these stocks remain in full effect. Let's quickly review.Plug Power and Bloom Energy, both of which got their start as pure-play ""fuel-cell stocks,"" are both segueing higher up the supply chain and developing hydrogen production businesses, as well, to produce the ""fuel"" that will go into their fuel cells (and perhaps other companies' fuel cells, too) going forward. In so doing, they're positioning themselves to profit from an international trend toward developing hydrogen economies -- in particular in Europe, where governments plan to invest ""hundreds of billions of euros in technologies enabling [Europe] to get a substantial share of its energy from hydrogen by 2050.""Whenever you hear about someone spending ""hundreds of billions of dollars"" on anything -- a stock price spike is sure to follow.Next up: Piedmont, which is benefiting from the other big trend in alternative energy today. Piedmont signed a five-year supply agreement to produce lithium for Tesla last month. And as if that weren't already good news, soon after this deal was announced, researchers in Europe put out a study predicting that by 2050, every vehicle on Earth will be electric and need lithium for its batteries -- and lithium supplies on Earth are only half what we thought they were.Both Plug, Bloom, and Piedmont are benefiting from significant macroeconomic tailwinds that are driving their stocks higher -- even today, when there's no particular news of note. To me, this looks like momentum investing, and for that reason, I have to warn you that it can be a dangerous kind of investing to rely on.Why? Let me direct your attention, once again, to the target date for when all these wonderful renewable energy trends will come to fruition: 2050. Not to belabor the obvious, but 2050 is a long way away, and a lot might happen to change these hydrogen and lithium stories over the next 30 years.Hydrogen vehicles could prove less cost effective than hoped. New lithium supplies could be found (perhaps in space?), driving down the cost of lithium. Or Lockheed Martin could finally perfect its small-fusion reactor, rendering both hydrogen and lithium moot.Or more simply, both the hydrogen and lithium ""stories"" could prove 100% accurate... but the companies that produce the hydrogen and the lithium still fail to make a profit, just as the fuel-cell companies have failed to do for decades already.I'm happy that investors in these companies are reaping windfall profits today. Just don't assume that today's stock gains will continue 30 years into the future -- because ultimately, companies need profits to sustain their stock prices, and for now, at least, profits are the one thing that all three of these companies lack.10 stocks we like better than Plug PowerWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Tesla is currently still in litigation with another former employee of its Nevada Gigafactory, who was fired in 2018 after being accused of hacking the company's systems.

17,"Oct 7, 2020 12:49AM EDT","Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock has soared by over 4x this year and Teslaâs market cap stands at about $400 billion, compared to about $50 billion for the BMW Group. Tesla also trades at a trailing P/S multiple that is almost 40x BMWs.Â  This comes despite the fact that BMWâs revenues are about 5x Teslaâs, and its deliveries are about 6x Teslaâs. Does this make sense? Not entirely, but there are a couple of factors that support a valuation premium for Tesla, including its significantly higher growth, expanding margins, and growing software sales. In this analysis, we compare Teslaâs financial and operating metrics with the automotive business of the BMW Group. We break-up our analysis into revenue metrics, margins, and cost metrics. See our complete analysis BMW And Tesla: A Detailed Comparison for more details. Parts of the analysis are summarized below.Teslaâs Deliveries A Fraction OF BMW, But Its Clearly Gaining Ground In the U.S.Â Teslaâs Total Deliveries Stood At 370K Units In 2019, Compared To About 2.5 Million Units For The BMW Group. Teslaâs deliveries have risen from about 32k units in 2014 to 368k units in 2019, a growth rate of over 60% per year, driven partly by the launch of the Model 3 in 2017. BMW, on the other hand, has seen its total deliveries (including Mini and Rolls Royce) grow from 2.1 million units to 2.5 million, a growth rate of under 4%. Tesla has considerable room to scale up, given that it still largely caters to the U.S. market with just 4 models in its lineup, including the Model Y that was launched earlier this year. In comparison, BMW has over 10 model lines, with multiple variants. Tesla already sells more Model 3 vehicles in the United States than all of BMWâs luxury sedans, so this could be an indicator of its potential as it scales up globally, with new factories. Moreover, Tesla also plans to offer increasingly affordable vehicles going forward.Teslaâs ASPs have declined from $95k in 2014 to $57k in 2019 and itâs likely that the number will fall further as the sales mix of Model 3 and Model Y rises. BMWâs ASPs have declined from $47k in 2014 to $43k in 2019. Teslaâs Automotive Revenues have grown from $3 billion in 2014 to $21Â  billion in 2019. In comparison, BMWâs revenues grew from $100 billion to $109 billion. How Do Teslaâs Cost & Margin Metrics Compare With BMWTeslaâs Automotive Gross margins were roughly comparable with BMWâs Gross margins at about 21% in 2019. Note that we are adding back R&D expenses to BMWâs reported gross margins, as the company considers R&D a part of direct costs. Tesla is also making solid progress in reducing its operating expenses. Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses as % of revenues stood at 11% in 2019, down from 19% in 2014, as the company streamlined its retail operations. The metric for BMW has remained in the 8% to 9% range over the same period. On the R&D front, Tesla has significantly scaled back its expenses, with the metric falling from 15% in 2014 to 5% in 2019, bringing them roughly in line with BMWâs. As Tesla continues to double down on self-driving software sales, cuts battery costs, and builds a greater scale with new factories and models, itâs very likely that its margins will scale up further, eclipsing BMWs.While Tesla is certainly selling more cars and doing so more efficiently, this alone doesnât justify its massive valuation premium over BMW. Investors are taking a long-term view with Tesla, betting that the companyâs innovative tech and the vision of CEO Elon Musk could help it play a big role in the future of the transportation industry. The stock makes sense at current valuations only if you believe inÂ  Teslaâs massive self-driving leadership and that growing software-as-a-service salesÂ will translate into sizable profits down the road.What if youâre looking for a more balanced portfolio instead? Hereâs a high-quality portfolio to beat the market, with over 100% return since 2016, versus 50% for the S&P 500. Comprised of companies with strong revenue growth, healthy profits, lots of cash, and low risk, it has outperformed the broader market year after year, consistently.See allÂ Trefis Price EstimatesÂ andÂ DownloadÂ Trefis DataÂ hereWhatâs behind Trefis?

18,"Oct 6, 2020 5:46PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNio (NYSE:NIO) has been absolutely on fire this year, with NIO stock surging nearly 400% higher on the back of abundant optimism that the company is finally turning into what it was hyped up to be from the start: the Tesla of China. This optimism is not misplaced. EVs are taking over the world, and NIO does project as the Tesla of China.To that end, while the rally in Nio’s stock has been jaw-dropping in 2020, this uptrend is here to stay. After all, NIO is still worth just $25 billion. Tesla, by comparison, is worth $400 billion.Over the next several years, China’s auto market will get electrified, NIO will dominate the premium segment of that market and sell a ton of luxury EVs at favorable margins, revenues and profits will surge higher, and NIO will soar toward $40 per share.On the bottom line, this means you should buy NIO today because its winning streak is far from over.I’ve said it before (many, many times) and I’ll say it again.Electric vehicles are the future of transportation.Demand is shifting, as young consumers — who are hyper-aware of the environment and want to “save the planet” — are shunning gas cars in favor of EVs, with a 2018 survey from HPI finding that 91% of millennials are considering buying an electric car for their next vehicle purchase.Importantly, these young consumers are only acquiring more and more purchasing power, and — by the 2030s — will be the largest driving force in the automobile market.A the same time, the technology is improving, because the aforementioned demand shift is attracting more and more resources and talent into the EV space — the sum of which is driving huge advancements in EV battery technology, so that these cars are driving farther, recharging faster and getting way, way cheaper (the median sales price of a new EV dropped 70% between 2010 and 2016).These technological improvements will only accelerate over the next several years alongside accelerating demand, and — by the 2030s — EVs will be able to drive for thousands of miles, will recharge in minutes and will cost far less than your average diesel car.Thus, by the 2030s, every prospective car buyer will want an EV, and those EVs will be deliver significant performance at affordable prices.It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to connect those dots.Between now and 2040, EVs will go from niche to ubiquitous. Alongside that exciting journey, pioneering EV makers — like NIO — will grow by leaps and bounds.NIO is an especially attractive play in the EV space because the EV opportunity in China — NIO’s home market — is huge.It’s no surprise that — with over 1.4 billion people — China is home to the world’s largest auto market. And it’s not even close. About 64 million new passenger cars were sold in 2019. Just under 21.5 million of them were sold in China. So, one out of every three new passenger cars sold in the world in 2019, was sold in China.Thanks to robust government support, China’s huge auto market is also home to the world’s most mature EV market. One out of every two EVs sold in the world in 2019, was sold in China.This robust government support isn’t going away anytime soon. China is targeting 25% EV sales penetration by 2025 — versus less than 5% penetration today. If that happens, it means China’s annual EV delivery volumes will reach over 5 million by 2025 — up 4+ million (or ~360%) from 2019 levels.In other words, the EV opportunity in China is both huge (because of China’s enormous auto market) and has high visibility (because of the Chinese government’s continued strong support of clean energy adoption).To that end, the biggest and best names in the EV megatrend — ex Tesla — may emerge out of China. In that group of Chinese EV makers, NIO is the best-in-breed when it comes to premium EVs — implying huge long-term upside potential for NIO stock.Make no mistake about it. NIO is absolutely killing the game in China’s premium EV market.The company has rattled off five consecutive months of triple-digit deliveries growth, including 104% year-over-year growth in August. And that’s with just two vehicles, the ES6 and ES8. The company just launched a third vehicle, the EC6, which should help spark even bigger growth in the last few months of the year.Importantly, NIO is doing this while China’s EV market isn’t booming. Thanks to the pandemic, China’s EV volumes are expected to drop 11% this year. NIO’s volumes will likely rise by more than 100%.So, this isn’t a “rising tide lifting all boats” dynamic. It’s a “speed boat leaving everyone else in the dust” dynamic.What’s NIO doing so right?They’ve cultivated strong brand equity and customer loyalty through Tesla-like marketing. They’ve cut out a high-demand and burgeoning niche in the premium market, and have proceeded to dominate that niche with superior performance vehicles. And they’ve continued to lean into a novel battery-swapping model which removes the cost of battery ownership from the driver, and therefore significantly reduces the prices of its EVs.All in all, NIO is absolutely killing the game in China’s premium EV market. So long as the company continues to do so, Nio’s stock will stay on a winning path.In the long run, my model suggests that there’s huge upside potential for NIO.My long-term model on NIO makes the following assumptions:Under those assumptions, I see NIO stock running to $40 by the end of the decade (using a 17X forward earnings multiple).Nio is a long-term winner that offers investors a high-visibility, big-potential way to play the EV megatrend. To that end, I wouldn’t give up on the stock just because it’s been on such a tear in 2020. Instead, I’d stick with the rally, and check back on the NIO price in a decade.Spoiler alert: it’ll be much higher than where it sits today.On the date of publication, Luke Lango did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The New Daily 10X Stock Report: 98.7% Accuracy – Gains Up to 466.78%.

19,"Oct 6, 2020 3:24PM EDT","By Noel RandewichOct 6 (Reuters) - Tesla's TSLA.O upcoming quarterly report could put another $3 billion in Chief Executive Elon Musk's pocket.The electric car maker on Tuesday saw the six-month average of its stock market value hit $250 billion, a milestone toward triggering the fourth of 12 tranches of options to buy Tesla stock at a discount, granted to the billionaire in his 2018 pay package.Musk's compensation is exclusively made up of a series of potential stock options rewards based on market capitalization and operational goals. To secure Musk's fourth tranche, Tesla still must hit a goal related to revenue or profitability, and that could happen in the company's third-quarter report, the date of which has yet to be announced.Tesla’s stock was down 0.8% at mid-day on Tuesday, but the company's six-month average market capitalization rose, thanks to a strong rally in recent months.Each tranche gives Musk the option to buy 8.44 million Tesla shares at $70 each, about a sixth of their current price.At Tesla’s current stock price of $420, Musk would theoretically be able to sell the shares related to the upcoming tranche, plus three other tranches that vested in recent months, for a combined profit of $11.8 billion, or almost $3 billion per tranche.Musk’s first tranche was worth about $700 million in May, when it vested, but its value has increased along with Tesla’s stock price.The Silicon Valley billionaire's pay package, which surpasses anything previously granted to top U.S. executives, was controversial when it was approved by shareholders. The median compensation for Tesla employees last year was about $58,000, according to a company filing.Tesla’s stock has surged 400% in 2020 as the company increased sales of its Model 3 sedan, giving it stock market value of almost $400 billion. After Tesla last week said it delivered a record 139,300 vehicles in the third quarter, investors are now awaiting the company's quarterly financial report. While investors focus on gross margins, free cash flow and earnings per share in that report, adjusted EBITDA will be key to Musk's personal finances. EBITDA, which stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, is a non-GAAP operating metric that Tesla further customizes by excluding the cost of stock-based compensation, including Musk's.In the four quarters through June, Tesla's adjusted EBITDA reached $4.42 billion, just short of a $4.5 billion milestone that would open the way for Musk's next options tranche.JPMorgan estimated in a recent client note that Tesla will report adjusted EBITDA of $1.183 billion for the September quarter, which would raise Tesla's rolling four quarters of adjusted EBITDA to $4.52 billion. That, along with Tuesday's increase in the company's six-month average market capitalization, would qualify Musk for his next options payout.Elon Musk's expanding payouthttps://tmsnrt.rs/30EelbG(Reporting by Noel Randewich, editing by Peter Henderson and Nick Zieminski)((noel.randewich@tr.com; (415) 677 2542; Reuters Messaging: Twitter: @randewich))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/teslas-quarterly-report-could-land-musk-another-%243-billion-2020-10-06

20,"Oct 6, 2020 2:53PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTech stocks suffered a massive selloff in September, leading to renewed interest in some of the biggest tech juggernauts, including, but not limited to, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Hard to believe that Jeff Bezos’ trillion-dollar conglomerate could be considered cheap. But the fact that AMZN stock is approximately 12% shy of its 52-week high will entice most investors. Considering the name involved here is Amazon.Plus, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently had respective stock splits. It’s not a given, but Amazon appears as the most likely candidate to move in that direction, next. Although not an elixir for stock prices, recent splits have led to steep gains in share prices for the companies involved. As a result, if the bulls are correct, this could be the shot in the arm AMZN stock needs. It also means that you should buy shares right now to take advantage of the possible uptick.Apart from the stock split, the usual positive beats in Amazon’s performance should keep you interested. Sales are up, and the company is now looking to roll out drone tech for deliveries extensively. That will reduce the headcount for Amazon prospectively and lead to a better bottom line.Any way you slice it, AMZN stock is looking pretty good right now.Stock splits are back in vogue this year, with Apple and Tesla leading the charge. Splits don’t have anything to do with fundamentals. However, they do end up attracting higher investor interest. Considering Amazon last did a stock split two decades ago, it seems pretty likely that it will go ahead and do one this year. After all, share prices need a bit of a lift after the tech sell-off.There are a couple of other factors in play here as well. Firstly, the stock split will help the company gain admittance to the prestigious Dow Jones Industrial Average – the world’s most famous stock market index. It does sound surprising that one of the world’s wealthiest companies is not on the Dow, but there you have it.The anomaly is because the 122-year-old index is price-weighted, the influence of each company on there is based on their per-share value. A company like Amazon will end up dominating the other members just by being, well, Amazon. That’s why unless there is a stock split, it doesn’t look like the tech giant will have its day in the sun on the Dow, a further incentive for the stock split.At this point, its no use talking up Amazon’s prowess in terms of financial metrics. Every quarter usually beats analyst expectations and is better than the one before it. The second quarter was no different, with net sales increasing by 40% to $88.9 billion from the year-ago figure of $63.4 billion. Meanwhile, free-cash-flow, a metric that Bezos values considerably, jumped by 27.6% year on year to finish at $31.85 billion for the quarter.Amazon Web Services or AWS, Amazon’s cloud computing service, keeps adding new customers, with HSBC (NYSE:HSBC) and Formula 1 Racing among the new entrants to its roster. The only point of concern that Amazon might have is Walmart (NYSE:WMT) recently launching its $98/year subscription “Plus” service. It will serve as a direct competitor to Amazon Prime, but time will tell if it’s able to make inroads into Amazon’s established markets.Back in August, Amazon got the go-ahead for its drone delivery system from federal regulators. That makes it the third significant entity after UPS (NYSE:UPS) and Google parent  Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) to get the nod. A potential game-changer, drone tech will be a significant contributor to the bottom line for Amazon in the foreseeable future.Drones, unlike humans, do not get sick, take leave or suffer from motivational issues. You could go ahead and use them around the clock without fail. Also, personnel costs contribute significantly to aggregate expenses for Amazon. Shipping and operating the fulfillment centers represented 30% of total operating costs last year. I am not saying that these costs will disappear overnight. But a gradual shift to drones will help in this area. Personnel, warehouse and delivery costs are a significant segment of the expenses for Amazon, one they would gladly want to reduce. Drones, an environmentally friendly option, will help greatly in this regard.You never waste column space when talking about AMZN stock. Whenever you broach the topic, there seems to be an infinite number of ways Amazon is revolutionizing how we do business. Whether it is the drone deliveries, AWS, Alexa, or its e-commerce platform, there is always something that the company is working on.That’s why it’s not surprising Amazon has become the preeminent company in the retail space. With such a strong supply line, it will continue to gobble up anyone that comes in front of it. Therefore, the recent pullback makes AMZN stock even more enticing to any retail investor out there.AMZN stock is a firm “buy”; snap it up before it makes up lost ground.On the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. Faizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

21,"Oct 6, 2020 2:19PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBy now, I’m sure at least some of you are getting quite tired hearing about special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs. Seemingly every other market debut is a SPAC, essentially a backdoor way of doing an initial public offering. Nevertheless, Gores Metropoulos (NASDAQ:GMHI) stock has attracted much attention and for good reason.By buying GMHI stock, you’re getting a stake in Luminar Technologies (once the transaction is complete), one of the startups in autonomous driving innovations.Specifically, Luminar Technologies specializes in an advanced system based off lidar, or light detection and ranging. Utilizing pulses of electromagnetic radiation, lidar signals “ping” off objects and calculates their distance based on the time it takes for the signal to return.Since the speed of light is a constant, lidar systems are incredibly accurate. Further, with proprietary adjustments, companies like Luminar can greatly enhance the range of object detection.To be clear, the case for GMHI stock isn’t so much the lidar system itself. Rather, it’s the innovations that Luminar has incorporated that makes its superior to other lidar-based platforms. Perhaps the most impressive is the company’s three-dimensional velocity detection system. Whether it’s a car changing lanes or a pedestrian that inadvertently crossed into an autonomous vehicle’s path, Luminar’s system can pick up and classify the object and make the necessary (or appropriate) avoidance measures.Another factor supporting GMHI stock is the underlying company’s stress testing. Most autonomous technologies today incorporate lidar due to its range and accuracy. However, traditional lidar systems have been stymied with inclement weather. For instance, a typical system could mistake falling snowflakes as a wall in the middle of the freeway. Obviously, that’s not something you want.However, Luminar’s goal is to achieve full autonomous driving at scale. Clearly, if a driverless vehicle couldn’t perform in various weather conditions, it would be rendered pointless. But the company has put its lidar system through the ringer with very encouraging results.Of course, nothing is without some disadvantages to consider. For GMHI stock, the underlying lidar technology has been cost-prohibitive. But even here, Luminar has managed to get its proprietary system down to a reasonable cost and with outstanding performance. At this point, you might be thinking that this is a unicorn company.That was my initial thought as well. However, when something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Don’t get me wrong – I don’t have anything against GMHI stock. Certainly, the science sounds incredibly compelling. But here’s something to chew on before you dive in – Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk is no fan of lidar.In last year’s edition of Autonomy Day, Musk stated:LiDAR is a fool’s errand…Anyone relying on LiDAR is doomed. Doomed! [They are] expensive sensors that are unnecessary. It’s like having a whole bunch of expensive appendices. Like, one appendix is bad, well now you have a whole bunch of them, it’s ridiculous, you’ll see.If you had any doubts about Musk’s conviction, he added that lidar is “lame.” It’s not just the expense issue, which Luminar has addressed. Rather, it’s that lidar relies on data interpretation. However, with a camera, you’re mimicking natural vision. Over time, it’s theoretically possible that camera sensors can read road signs, even those that are put up impromptu. By relaying this information, camera-based autonomous vehicles can possibly make better decisions than lidar-based vehicles.Also, another factor that supports cameras is that they are passive systems. In other words, a driverless vehicle can “see” other cars without interfering with the environment. Again, this mimics human functionality, unless you’re one of those mutants that can shoot laser beams out of your eyes.That’s not really a joke because that’s basically what happens with lidar, which is an active system. In order for this platform to detect objects, it must somehow “touch” them. Unfortunately, this means that the safety profile regarding the 1550nm wavelength that Luminar utilizes is not quite clear.This is a controversial issue because other experts state that 1550nm lasers are safer for the eyes than the more popular 905nm wavelength. Nevertheless, I’m not entirely clear on the safety implications, as well as potential interference resulting from lasers being shot all over the place should this technology go mainstream.Interestingly, both Luminar and Tesla claim to benefit from their respective autonomous systems because of mass data collection. Thanks to profound artificial intelligence technologies, machines can learn from the collection of real-world data, finetuning their capacity exponentially.While that’s great and all, here’s a fact that can trump both lidar and camera-based systems: the human brain will always be superior to the best AI or autonomous system ever developed.Consider for instance the massively sized supercomputer, which forms the basis of multiple advanced technologies. To get around the enormous space and energy requirements of supercomputers, IBM (NYSE:IBM) invented Blue Gene. This radically reduced the size and cost of these remarkable machines.Yet Blue Gene is not what you would call cheap to run in absolute terms. It still consumes substantial energy, enough so that it requires thousands of gallons of water to cool the system. Further, IBM’s supercomputer requires multiple stacks of processors that are as tall as an average-sized human male.The point is, if you want true autonomy, you must apply a brute-force method by incorporating more processing power, which increases size and energy requirements. And all that computing capacity can’t replace the instinct and on-the-spot decision-making capabilities of the human brain, which weighs on average about three pounds.Frankly, driving is much more than knowing the exact distance of an object 200 meters away. All drivers operate on a mixture of training, personal experiences and gut reactions. To replace these attributes via AI may be impossible – who knows? More realistically, I see autonomous technology being utilized as a driver assistance rather than a driver replacement.But in the meantime, buying shares of GMHI stock isn’t a bad way of speculating on the next big thing. In the immediate term, lidar has more practical capabilities. Just be careful that in the long run, improving camera sensors may give lidar-based systems serious competition.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

23,"Oct 6, 2020 1:44PM EDT","It's looking like Tuesday's stock market will be a confusing one for lithium battery investors, as stocks of all stripes move in differing directions despite little ""new"" news.In 12:10 p.m. EDT trading, for instance, we see shares of Chinese lithium battery manufacturer CBAK Energy Technology (NASDAQ: CBAT) giving up an early 20% gain to settle down up just 2.1%. Things don't get much clearer further up the supply chain, where Piedmont Lithium (NASDAQ: PLL) is up 22% and holding onto its gains, but Lithium Americas (NYSE: LAC) is losing 11.7%.Let's see if we can make some sense of this mess.Image source: Getty Images.We'll begin with CBAK Energy, a small-cap maker of batteries in China that's so under the radar that we haven't written about it here at The Motley Fool even once -- but that is getting some attention here in the wake of Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) ballyhooed Battery Day last month.Despite sporting a market capitalization just 1,470th that of Tesla, CBAK bills itself as a competitor to the electric cars-and-batteries pioneer. In a press release last week, CBAK argued that its dual ""tabless"" rechargeable lithium battery was superior to ""Tesla's cathode tabless design in its 4680 model,"" offering ""greatly improved"" performance. Â Just corporate trash talk, you say? Perhaps. But CBAK says its ""32140 large-sized cylindrical tabless battery has officially passed its technical and Pilot Plant tests,"" and the company is gearing up for ""mass product delivery in the first half of 2021."" For car companies that compete with Tesla, CBAK's offering of a bigger battery with ""5 times"" more energy capacity per sell and a ""20% reduction in cost per kilowatts"" could prove attractive.Next, moving up the supply chain just a bit, we come to start-up lithium miners Piedmont Lithium and Lithium Americas, which as I mentioned, are moving in opposite directions. Why might thisÂ be?Analyst reports of an impending crunch in lithium supply are certainly a factor. As Tesla continues to ramp up production, and other carmakers develop and market their own electric car alternatives, demand for both rechargeable batteries and the lithium to make them is sure to rise. Still, at present, neither Piedmont nor Lithium Americas is producing lithium metal at scale.Â The main difference: Piedmont has secured a supply agreement with Tesla, while Lithium Americas has not. Granted, even Piedmont's deal appears to be conditional upon the company being able to begin deliveries before July 2023, which is far from certain. Still, having that deal in hand gives Piedmont a significant leg up over the competition.This, in a nutshell, is why I think Piedmont stock is continuing to rise today, while Lithium Americas is starting to fall.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

24,"Oct 6, 2020 12:39PM EDT","Tuesday brought a pause to the stock market's recent advance, as investors tried to determine how to balance all the conflicting dynamics affecting the financial markets. Rising long-term interest rates signaled greater belief that the U.S. government would succeed in providing more economic support to Americans, but definitive agreements weren't forthcoming.Just before 11:30 a.m. EDT today, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) was higher by just 9 points to 28,157. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) had lost 7 points to 3,401, and the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) had fallen 68 points to 11,264.Even with the upward momentum in the broader market starting to wane, there are still pockets of strength. One remains technology, with Alteryx (NYSE: AYX) leading the charge higher Tuesday. Elsewhere, the mining space has perked up, especially with smaller companies like Piedmont Lithium (NASDAQ: PLL) seeking to provide valuable minerals for battery technology.Image source: Getty Images.Shares of Alteryx soared 26% on Tuesday morning. The data analytics provider made a major leadership announcement and provided some guidance on its future results.Alteryx announced that it expects revenue for the third quarter to be $126 million to $128 million. That would represent growth of 22% to 24% from year-earlier levels. More importantly, it was far above the initial guidance of $111 million to $115 million that Alteryx had issued previously.The company also said that it has brought on a new executive. Mark Anderson will take over as CEO from co-founder Dean Stoecker, who will stay on as chair of the Alteryx board of directors. Anderson has served on the board for a couple of years now, and Stoecker expressed his confidence in him as ""the ideal candidate to serve as Alteryx's next CEO.""The stock took a tumble earlier this year as investors called into question whether the data analytics company would be able to sustain its former pace of growth. Today's news suggests that those concerns were unjustified, and new leadership could bring new accomplishments for Alteryx.Elsewhere, Piedmont Lithium climbed 23%, adding to gains from earlier in the week. The lithium mining upstart has gotten a lot of notoriety from a recent supply contract, and forces in the battery materials industry are helping support the share price today.Piedmont was relatively unknown until Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) signed a five-year contract with the company to buy high-grade lithium ore from Piedmont's proposed North Carolina mining and refining project. At that point, the miner came onto investors' radar.Also helping is a recent executive order from the White House identifying other battery-making materials as essential minerals vital to U.S. interests. Although lithium wasn't included in the executive order's list, it stands to benefit from greater attention to other minerals used in battery production.The deal still involves plenty of uncertainty. Piedmont is far from beginning operations, and the agreement will require both parties to figure out more specifics about a start date between mid-2022 and mid-2023. If Piedmont can't get everything up and running by then, Tesla would have the right to undo the agreement -- and presumably all of the mining stock's gains would be for naught.10 stocks we like better than AlteryxWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

25,"Oct 6, 2020 12:29PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBack in early June, after the Nio (NYSE:NIO) share price had popped from $2 and change to $5.50, I predicted that Nio stock still had plenty of room to keep running. Somehow, I suspected that the company would remain in hyper-growth mode for a while longer.Amazingly, on Oct. 2, the Nio stock price closed at an eye-popping $21.18. While I projected some share-price growth, I won’t claim to have known in June that the stock would catapult above by early October.The available data certainly paints a picture of a fast-developing electric vehicle manufacturer. As a result, I wouldn’t recommend attempting to short-sell Nio stock. That would just be foolhardy as the share price could keep on moving higher based on market hype and enthusiasm.As for prospective long-side investors, there’s no going back now. We can’t turn back the clock and buy Nio stock at $5 or even $10. All we can do is assess whether the risk-versus-reward profile is favorable at this point. This, then, will require some technical analysis.Even though Nio stock shed 2.67% on Oct. 2, the share price still remained up a heart-pounding 427% on a year-to-date basis. This makes the share-price surge I wrote about in June seem quaint in comparison.With that, Nio stock didn’t only achieve its 52-week high in October. It reached its all-time high, far exceeding any price point in the stock’s history.That might be exciting for traders who prefer to focus on momentum. On the other hand, the melt-up in the Nio stock price may cause concern among contrarians and investors who prefer value over exuberance.And indeed, it’s difficult to find deep value in Nio stock at the moment. If you can believe it, the stock’s trailing 12-month earnings per share is -$44.10. That’s on a stock which trades at $21 and change. It’s probably not a good sign.On the other side of the coin is Nio’s recent performance, not as a stock but as a company. Viewing things from that angle, the argument turns decidedly bullish.The company’s improvement can best be expressed through Nio’s freshly released automobile delivery figures. In particular, for the month of September, Nio delivered 4,708 vehicles. That signifies a 133.2% increase on a year-over-year basis.Moreover, Nio delivered 12,206 vehicles during the third quarter of 2020. That represents a 154.3% year-over-year improvement. It’s also above the higher end of Nio’s guidance for the third quarter.The impressive growth in Nio’s vehicle deliveries was likely a factor in Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu’s decision to reiterate his “buy” rating on Nio stock. Along with that, Yu maintained his upbeat price target of $24.Even with the optimistic rating and price target on Nio stock, Yu seems to concede that the company continues to face stiff competition from its peers.“The main push back we received on our bullish view is NIO’s brand does not create the same level of excitement and loyalty in China that Tesla or the German luxury auto makers command,” commented Yu.He’s making an important point there. As noteworthy as Nio’s improvement has been, the company simply doesn’t have the scale, the capital or the name recognition of electric vehicle behemoth Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).Indeed, I would suspect that the Nio stock price has gotten ahead of itself because some shareholders are wagering that Nio will be the next Tesla. Yet, this might or might not happen.Nio is still a tiny company. Compared to the performance of some other automakers, 12,206 vehicle deliveries during a full quarter is small potatoes. Nonetheless, long-side traders have bid the share price up to the high heavens based on the assumption that Nio’s growth will continue on its current trajectory.As an automaker in hyper-growth mode, Nio might live up to traders’ expectations and continue to deliver more record-setting quarters.However, that assumption of success has, I believe, largely been priced into Nio stock already. I’m still rooting for the company to succeed, but value-focused investors should wait for the share price to come back down to earth before jumping into the trade.On the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.The post Now That Everybody Loves Nio, It’s Time to Start Taking Profits appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/now-that-everybody-loves-nio-its-time-to-start-taking-profits-2020-10-06

27,"Oct 6, 2020 9:38AM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInterested investors have undoubtedly heard of SPAC offerings. This investment vehicle has hit Wall Street and garnered big-time attention among investors. As a result, Spartan Energy Acquisition (NYSE:SPAQ) has also caught investors’ attention. Shares of Spartan Energy Acquisition erupted higher in June. Of course, that was around when shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Nio (NYSE:NIO), Workhorse (NASDAQ:WKHS) and Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) were ripping higher, too. I mean, Tesla garnered a market capitalization of $475 billion at one point in the run. Of course, there’s the consideration of how others have succeeded in going public via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). In the same electric vehicle (EV) space is Nikola and Workhorse, which both came public via a SPAC offering. While Nikola has had plenty of drama lately, its success in making it to the public markets is noteworthy. Then there are other successful plays like Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) and DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG), which both went public via SPAC offerings. So what exactly is Spartan Energy Acquisition?As Tezcan Gecgil wrote in August, “Spartan had initially agreed with Fisker, a relatively recent addition to the world of electric vehicle (EV) makers, on a reverse merger. The initial date was set for Aug. 14. However, that date has now been delayed to Feb. 14, 2021.”In short, what is Spartan Energy Acquisition? It is essentially Fisker. The EV space has been red-hot in 2020 with investors pouring resources into these names. Personally, I don’t get it. Short of Nio and Tesla, many of these businesses don’t even have revenues. It was absurd to me that Nikola had achieved a higher market cap than Ford (NYSE:F) at one point, without any sales. Heck, the company hasn’t even completed its production facility yet. How can it be worth more than a well-established automaker? As a result, there is both opportunity and risk with Spartan Energy Acquisition. On the one hand, there is the possibility that investors stick with the EV enthusiasm. Again, I don’t get it, but my opinion doesn’t matter. I love Tesla’s cars, but I do not think the company is worth $400 billion at this point. But that doesn’t mean investors won’t bid it up to a $500 billion valuation and take its peers higher, too. On the flip side, Spartan Energy Acquisition faces multiple risks. First, there has been a flood of SPAC offerings. It’s very possible the market gets “SPAC-ed out” and these names struggle in the future. It’s also possible that investors start paying attention to the fundamentals. Nikola and Workhorse have generous valuations despite lacking fundamentals. If that’s the case, newcomers to the space may struggle. At least Tesla is the global EV leader and at least Nio has momentum on its side. Finally, there’s the whole Nikola debacle. After being called a fraud, the company is under the microscope. The SEC is investigating it, the stock is getting hit, and despite the recent good news on a partnership with General Motors (NYSE:GM), GM is seemingly second-guessing the company it saddled up with. Will this cause traditional automakers to be leery of Spartan Energy Acquisition? It’s certainly possible. Early in this article, I referenced the “explosion” higher in the share price. Shares of Spartan Energy Acquisition almost doubled in just a couple of days in June. However, that rally soon fizzled out. In mid-September, shares again caught a whiff of momentum. However, Spartan Energy Acquisition wasn’t able to take out its June highs, securing a lower high in the process. Near the end of the month, the stock repeated the pattern, allowing a downtrend resistance line to form (purple line). At the same time, the 50-day moving average and uptrend support (blue line) continue to hold. The stock is sending mixed signals, but we can use levels to help guide us. On the upside, a close above $15 puts shares back above the 20-day moving average and downtrend resistance. That opens the door to a rally back toward $17.50 and the September high up at $18.24.On the downside, a close below the 50-day moving average and uptrend support puts the September low in play at $12.52. In fact, this was a double-bottom low, hit on Sept. 4 and Sept. 24. A close below this mark likely puts the 200-day moving average on the table. On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.The post What Is Spartan Energy Acquisition and Is It a Buy? appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-is-spartan-energy-acquisition-and-is-it-a-buy-2020-10-06

28,"Oct 6, 2020 9:29AM EDT","For years, electric-vehicle investing meant one company: Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). Sure, Nissan had the Leaf and there were a few hybrids riding around, but Elon Musk's game-changing start-up was the only major player in the space.That's changing. And fast.Here are three big developments you need to know about in the world of electric-vehicle stocks.Image source: Getty Images.It's true: We're on track to see nearly a dozen new electric-vehicle stocks make their market debuts in 2020.Blame fuel cell-powered truck maker Nikola (NASDAQ: NKLA) for starting the craze, after it went public through a highly publicized reverse merger with special purpose acquisition corporation (SPAC) VectorIQ in June. Since then, we've seen the same reverse merger trick used by Lidar specialist Velodyne Lidar, Inc. (NASDAQ: VLDR) and electric powertrain manufacturer Hyliion, with electric vehicle manufacturers Lordstown Motors, Fisker, and Canoo expected to follow suit before the end of the year. Chinese EV companies Li Auto and Xpeng also went public this year, through traditional U.S. IPOs.With so many electric vehicle stocks hitting the market, investors need to look at the industry in a new way. A bet on Tesla in 2014 was a bet that the EV industry as a whole was viable. Now, even if the industry as a whole is successful, it's a near-certainty that at least one of these start-ups is going to flop. And with so much still in flux, it's not at all clear which one it will be.When Tesla finally went public in 2010, it had already been manufacturing its flagship Roadster for two years. But many of the EV companies that are debuting this year have never built a production vehicle at all. At least, not yet.Nikola is a prime example. Although it has built prototypes of its Nikola One, Nikola Two, and Nikola Tre semi trucks, it's never actually taken one of its vehicle designs through the production process, and in fact, doesn't even have a production facility built yet. Lordstown Motors has a facility in the former General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio, but it isn't expected to begin production of its first vehicle, the Endurance electric pickup, until 2021. Canoo's first vehicle, an all-electric minivan, won't debut until 2022.It's risky to invest in a manufacturing company that's never, well, manufactured anything. Remember how even Tesla ran into snags trying to ramp up Model 3 production in 2019? And that was after it had already had more than a decade of successful car production under its belt. Don't underestimate the potential of manufacturing problems to derail these companies' timelines.We've come a long way from the 1990s, when the big carmakers fought tooth and nail against offering electric vehicles as part of their product lineup. Today, every major automaker around the globe has at least one electric vehicle model currently for sale or in development. Many of these vehicles will hit the market in 2021 or 2022, if not sooner.The battery-electric crossover SUV seems to be the most popular vehicle on offer, with Tesla's Models X and Y already available, to be joined by Ford's Mustang Mach E by the end of the year. Nissan's Ariya will debut in 2021, along with new crossover SUV offerings from Audi, BMW, Volkswagen, and others. Meanwhile, Subaru and Toyota are jointly developing a pair of electric SUVs.Industry heavyweights aren't just developing their own cars, they're investing in smaller companies as well. For example, GM not only manufactures the Chevy Bolt, but owns a stake in Lordstown Motors and is also slated to invest in Nikola. Volkswagen is backing soon-to-go-public battery maker QuantumScape and is negotiating with Fisker regarding use of its technology in Fisker's Ocean SUV.The surge in interest among legacy automakers, coupled with all of the new start-ups, is likely to have a profound impact on the industry as a whole.By 2022, the global electric vehicle market will look profoundly different than it did just five years earlier. There will be new companies, new models, new technology, and -- most importantly -- new levels of competition among players in the space.Electric vehicle stock enthusiasts should expect that not all of their picks will be winners in this new world of EVs, and invest accordingly.10 stocks we like better than Nikola Corporation

30,"Oct 6, 2020 8:05AM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe last time I wrote about Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) was in late August. At the time, I argued that SPCE stock was worth buying for the long haul despite the dilution of a $460-million secondary offering.Up 18.8% from Aug. 25 through Oct. 2, the stock got most of its push from two analyst upgrades, InvestorPlace’s William White wrote on Sep. 28.“The first buy rating for Virgin Galactic stock comes from Bank of America analyst Ron Epstein. He says that no other company that the firm covers has ‘anywhere near comparable growth potential,’ to SPCE stock,” White said.The second buy rating — Susquehanna analyst Charles Minervino recently initiated coverage of Virgin Galactic at a “buy” — is based on the analysts’ belief that demand for space travel will be out-of-this-world hot.It’s hard to argue with either observation.That’s why in my last article about SPCE, I called it a long-term buy. Sometimes, the best investments defy traditional valuation standards. Virgin Galactic is one of those times.MarketWatch says there are seven analysts currently covering SPCE, including Epstein and Minervino. All seven analysts have a buy rating on its stock with an average target price of $25.43.Three months ago, only three analysts were covering the space tourism company. This time next year, I could see the analyst coverage double from where it is today.According to the mean analyst estimate, Virgin Galactic will lose $1.21 a share in fiscal 2020 and 69 cents in fiscal 2021. In the upcoming third quarter, analysts expect Virgin Galactic to lose 27 cents per share. Those really aren’t horrific numbers for a company that’s looking to send people into space.Recently, InvestorPlace’s David Moadel discussed Virgin Galactic’s countdown to profits. He believes that the total addressable market of 2.4 million high-net-worth individuals makes SPCE an excellent long-term pure-play buy. I couldn’t agree more.He also points out some other analysts who are on board the Virgin Galactic moonshot. Across the board, analysts have bought into Richard Branson’s vision for commercial space travel. Only something unforeseen is likely to drive SPCE off course.Currently trading above $20, my InvestorPlace colleague, Ian Cooper, stated in mid-September that the company’s stock could shoot into orbit on or around Oct. 22, the date of Virgin Galactic’s next test flight.“If Oct. 2020 test flights are successful, Virgin Galactic has said it plans to start flying by the first quarter of 2021. That could potentially fuel a multi-year boom for the Virgin Galactic stock,” Cooper wrote on Sep. 15.As Cooper suggests, the market for hypersonic flights to different parts of the world could be an even bigger piece of business for Virgin Galactic than commercial space flights.Together, the dual revenue streams make it difficult not to get excited about the company’s future.In March, I wondered if Virgin Galactic was the next Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).“As someone who’s always respected Virgin Group founder Richard Branson, the fact that Virgin owns 58.7% of Virgin Galactic suggests to me that if it’s not successful commercializing space flight, it won’t be from a lack of trying,” I wrote on March 11.“Yes, SPCE stock is speculative at this point in its history. However, since it’s down 56% in less than a month, buying shares now is much easier to justify.”It’s up more than 27% since then.However, Branson’s stake through his Virgin Group holding company has dropped from over 50% in May to 29.7% at the end of July to raise cash for some of the other companies affected by the novel coronavirus such as Virgin Atlantic.Make no mistake. The billionaire’s still very much a part of Virgin Galactic. As long as he is, I think you’ll see more analysts jump on board in the coming months.It’s just another reason I believe SPCE stock is one of the best speculative buys listed on a U.S. stock exchange.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. Will Ashworth has written about investments full-time since 2008.

31,"Oct 6, 2020 7:34AM EDT","Yesterday, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) announced it will make a $25,000 electric vehicle sometime in the near future, and it had me feeling some deja vu from the last decade following the solar industry. Ten years ago, I was extremely high on solar energy because costs were coming down, technology was getting better, and it only made sense that adoption would increase rapidly as solar power plants became more cost-competitive with fossil fuel power plants, and solar stocks would soar as a result.Most of the thesis was spot on. Solar energy production has exploded, solar panel efficiency is better than ever, and costs are now lower than fossil fuels in most locations. The problem? Very few solar stocks made any money. That experience has me nervous about Tesla stock's future, now that it's moving even further downmarket. And the risk translates to pure EV companies like Nikola (NASDAQ: NKLA), NIO (NYSE: NIO), and Workhorse (NASDAQ: WKHS), who are far less developed than Tesla is today.Image source: Tesla.Over the last few years, Tesla has gone from manufacturing vehicles that regularly sell for over $100,000 to promising to sell vehicles for $25,000. If we take those numbers as an example, Tesla would need to sell four times as many vehicles to generate the same revenue.But on the profit side, the picture typically gets worse as prices come down. If a $100,000 vehicle generates a 25% gross margin, as Tesla once aimed for, and a $25,000 vehicle generates a 15% gross margin, for example, you would have to sell 6.7 times more vehicles to make the same gross margin. And that trend is not only possible, but it's also likely for Tesla, and we saw it happen in the solar industry.Let's take First Solar (NASDAQ: FSLR) as an example. The company produced 1.4 gigawatts (GW) of solar panels in 2010 and increased that to 5.7 GW in 2019. But what did profits and margins do?FSLR Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsAs you may have guessed, both gross margin and net income were down over the past decade at First Solar. Costs were lower and production increased, but the increase in volume couldn't overcome the drop in margins, and profits have actually dropped as First Solar has grown.We can see margins trend lower in the auto industry as sale prices get lower as well. Take Ferrari (NYSE: RACE) compared to Ford (NYSE: F) and General Motors (NYSE: GM) as an example. In 2019, Ford sold 5.4 million vehicles worldwide and GM sold 7.7 million vehicles. On a scale basis they crush the 10,131 vehicles Ferrari sold, but right now Ferrari is more profitable than Ford over the last 12 months, and not far behind GM because its gross margin is nearly 50%, compared to single digits for Ford and GM. Long term, earnings are volatile, but it would be easy to argue that Ferrari is the auto stock that's generating the most shareholder value long term.RACE Net Income (TTM) data by YChartsNow, let's tie what we learn from the solar industry over the last decade with what we see in the auto industry. As Tesla grows production, moves downmarket, and reduces average sale prices, we would expect revenue growth to stall despite production increasing. And gross margins should come down as Tesla competes with lower-cost vehicles.The first already seems to be happening for Tesla. You can see below that revenue growth has stalled, despite production growing, in large part due to sales shifting from the higher-cost Model S/X to the lower-cost Model 3/Y.TSLA Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsThe decline in margins will take longer but you can see above that gross margin continues to be below the 25% benchmark that Elon Musk set for Tesla and is trending lower. And remember that electric vehicle (EV) competitors have been slow to ramp production, which could bring further pricing pressure, unless Tesla's brand allows it to command a premium for its EVs. Based on new product announcements, investors should expect competition to really heat up in the EV market in the next two to three years, which ironically coincides with Tesla going even further downmarket with a $25,000 vehicle.To be clear, I'm not arguing that Tesla is wrong in moving downmarket or increasing production. But I think it's worth understanding that profitability will not necessarily increase with production if the company's sales mix changes. Solar companies tried to grow volume enough to offset margin losses but couldn't in most cases. Tesla is trying to do the same in a business where companies who make lower-cost vehicles traditionally have trouble making consistent long-term profits. If we see margin pressure in the EV industry that looks anything like what we saw it in the solar industry, then Tesla may vastly underperform what investors appear to be predicting based on a $400 billion market cap. Understanding this history is important because investors who are bullish on EV growth can learn a lot from what happened to company finances as solar manufacturers lived through the growth phase of the industry. Despite the growth in solar deployment, solar stocks have struggled. You can see below that the biggest names in the industry today are lagging behind the market by a wide margin, and First Solar and SunPower (NASDAQ: SPWR) have lost investors' money since the start of 2010. Only Canadian Solar (NASDAQ: CSIQ) has squeaked out a gain, and it's a modest one at that. And these are the companies that survived. Massive manufacturers like Yingli Green Energy, Suntech Power, and SolarWorld filed for bankruptcy even as the industry grew.FSLR data by YChartsThe simple reason stocks haven't done well is because increased solar manufacturing and deployments haven't led to an increase in earnings, as you can see below.FSLR Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsThe reason solar stocks didn't do well over the past decade isn't that solar wasn't successful in disrupting fossil fuels, or because the amount of solar deployed each year didn't grow like crazy. It did and that was part of the problem. Costs had to come down to grow the market, and as the cost of solar panels came down so did margins. Manufacturers then had to compete more on price than technological differentiation. Margins came down eventually, earnings dropped, and stocks fell. For companies that layered on too much debt to expand, the only remedy was bankruptcy.EV manufacturing isn't exactly the same as solar, but there are lessons we can learn. I think it's clear that margins will come down as EVs become more affordable and Tesla, Ford, GM, and many others increase production. That'll force more price competition, which is ultimately why major automakers don't make much money on low-price vehicles today. These trends could lead to a sharp increase in EVs on the roads, but a big reduction in profits from each vehicle sold.With a market cap that's hovering around $400 billion, investors are eventually expecting Tesla to demonstrate it can make a consistent profit. But moving downmarket might not be the way to do it, and the solar industry provides some cautionary tales for investors.10 stocks we like better than Tesla

33,"Oct 5, 2020 11:34PM EDT","HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Corporate carve-ups generally provide a spark. LG Chemâs decision to spin off its batteries business has not electrified investors so far, however. Although some hesitation is warranted, the divisionâs true value is lost inside a $40 billion chemicals producer.   The South Korean conglomerate picked a good time for a split. Enthusiasm for electric vehicles is growing, powering manufacturersâ stock prices. LG Chem lays claim to the biggest worldwide market share for their batteries, supplying Tesla, General Motors and others. And yet rivals seem to attract higher valuations.  LG Chem shares have been on a tear, more than doubling since the start of the year. Some of that is attributable to what is now provisionally dubbed LG Energy Solutions, which also will house energy storage and small batteries. LG Chem projects sales for the group will more than double by 2024, to some 30 trillion won ($25.7 billion).    For now, the bigger top line belongs to plastics. Using Nomuraâs divisional estimates for 2021 EBITDA and multiples of comparable companies chosen by Breakingviews, the big petrochemicals division, along with smaller units that make products used in smartphones and develop drugs are worth almost $17 billion combined. LG Chemâs roughly $46 billion enterprise value therefore implies batteries are pegged at more than $29 billion.  On a standalone basis, things might look different. Blended estimates from Nomura and Mirae Asset Daewoo suggests LG Chemâs batteries will generate nearly $2 billion of EBITDA in the coming year. Valuations for CATL, Chinaâs BYD and Samsung SDI average out at about 23 times. On that multiple, LG Energy Solutions would be worth north of $46 billion, 56% more than what is imputed today.    There are understandable explanations for the muted market reaction to LG Chemâs mid-September separation announcement. For one thing, there will be some dilution if the parentâs ownership stake in batteries drops to 70-80%. Some shareholders also might dump LG Chem in favour of LG Energy. Moreover, an initial public offering is probably at least a year away. And Tesla's recently divulged battery plans could squeeze suppliers.  Even with all that factored in, though, itâs reasonable to expect a spark for LG Chem.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/breakingviews-lg-chem-will-get-a-charge-from-battery-spinoff-2020-10-06

34,"Oct 5, 2020 7:07PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCan Workhorse Group (NASDAQ:WKHS) stock muscle into the broader electric vehicle market? Currently, the Cincinnati, Ohio-based company is a niche player in the fast growing electric vehicle sector, focusing on electric powered delivery and utility vehicles. It’s a strategy that has, to date, paid off for the company and its shareholders.Workhorse stock has risen more than 700% this year, a staggering amount by any metric. The share price has rocketed to a high of $30.99 in September from $1.47. While the stock has since given up some of those gains, it is currently trading at around $25 a share.Much of the growth has come from the tremendous run up of stocks that are part of the broader electric vehicle sector, led by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), leaving investors wondering if Workhorse Group can broaden beyond its niche focus on commercial vehicles and maintain its torrid pace?Workhorse Group is a small company that’s competing for some big contracts. Most impressive, the company is currently on the shortlist for a U.S. Postal Service contract to purchase 180,000 new trucks to upgrade its national delivery fleet. Workhorse is on a shortlist of just three companies to win the lucrative Postal Service contract, estimated to be worth $6.3 billion. The other two companies on the list are Morgan Olson and an alliance between Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F) and Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK).While Workhorse Group is viewed as the underdog in the U.S. Postal Service contract lottery, the fact that the company is on the shortlist should be viewed as a vote of confidence (the original list of bidders totaled 15 companies). Many analysts feel that Workhorse Group is one big contract win away from outperforming electric vehicle leaders such as Tesla.The City of Orlando, Florida is also reported to be considering purchasing Workhorse Group’s electric utility trucks. Workhorse is in talks with General Motors (NYSE:GM) to takeover the Lordstown Assembly plant, a 6.2 million square foot manufacturing plant located in Lordstown, Ohio that Workhorse currently has a 10% stake in.While Workhorse Group’s delivery and utility vehicles are attracting attention, the company has yet to land any major contracts and remains unprofitable. Much of the lift in Workhorse stock is due to the fact that investors are snapping up shares of any and all electric vehicle companies, regardless of where they are at in terms of manufacturing and delivering automobiles.In addition to Workhorse Group and Tesla, other electric vehicle stocks that have had big runs this year include Nio (NYSE:NIO) and Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA).While a rising tide seems to be lifting all boats, it’s worth noting that Workhorse Group has been around since 1998 and became a publicly traded company in 2010. It’s not a flash in the pan. However, its niche focus on commercial electric vehicles may limit its potential market at a time when it is facing growing competition.The electric vehicle market has been growing exponentially in recent years and there are expected to be more than 250 million electric vehicles driven around the world by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). By some estimates, there are expected to be more than 100 different electric vehicle models available for sale in the U.S. by 2024 as major automotive manufactures such as GM, Volkswagen (ETR: VOW3) and Nissan (OTCMKTS:NSANY) ramp up plans to produce both commercial and consumer electric vehicles. The competition Workhorse Group faces is only going to become more fierce in coming years.In its most recent quarterly results ended June 30, Workhorse Group reported revenue of just $92,000 and operating expenses of $5.57 million. The company’s net loss was $131 million, mostly due to increased interest expenses of $124.3 million. These are not encouraging results and show clearly that Workhorse remains in start-up mode. There has been some speculation that the company might be targeted for a takeover by a larger, more established automaker.Given its lack of viable contracts and production as well as its poor financial results, investors would be best advised to steer clear of Workhorse stock for the time being. There are too many other more established electric vehicle makers and automotive companies available for investors to risk their hard earned money on.If the company wins the U.S. Postal Service contract or things change for the company in another fundamental way, then by all means consider buying shares. Until then, steer clear of Workhorse Group.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held shares of TSLA.The post Workhorse Group Stock Needs to Recharge appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/workhorse-group-stock-needs-to-recharge-2020-10-05

35,"Oct 5, 2020 6:11PM EDT","By Ben KlaymanDETROIT, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Electric vehicle startup Faraday Future aims to close a deal soon to go public through a reverse merger with a special-purchase acquisition company (SPAC), its chief executive said on Monday.""We are working on such a deal ... and will be able to announce something hopefully quite soon,"" Carsten Breitfeld said of the possibility of a SPAC deal.Breitfeld declined to say who Faraday is negotiating with or when a deal would close.A SPAC is a shell company that raises money through an initial public offering to buy an operating entity, typically within two years.SPACs have emerged as a quick route to the stock market for companies, particularly auto technology startups, and have proven popular with investors seeking to echo Tesla Inc's TSLA.O high stock valuation.Breitfeld, who joined the Los Angeles-based company as CEO last year, also said the company would deliver its first electric luxury SUV, the FF 91, nine months after securing funding, with volume production beginning 12 months after such a deal.Faraday has said it wants to raise $800 million to $850 million to launch the FF 91.It will initially build the vehicle at its plant in Hanford, California, but ultimately will use a contract manufacturer in Asia with which Breitfeld said Faraday has signed an agreement. He declined to identify the company.Once one of the more hyped EV startups, Faraday burned through $2 billion in cash and its founder Jia Yueting finalized his personal bankruptcy filing in June.Breitfeld said Jia no longer owns stock in Faraday, which is more than half owned by employees through an executive partnership and an employee stock ownership plan. Jia's stake had been a ""major blocking point"" to bringing in other investors, he said.Breitfeld acknowledged Faraday has struggled in the past with executing its business plan.""Because of the history and sometimes the bad news of the company, not everyone is really trusting us,"" he said. ""They want to see that we've become a stable company.""Breitfeld, a former BMW BMWG.DEexecutive, also co-founded Chinese EV startup Byton. Breitfeld left Byton in early 2019 and that company suspended production in July to reorganize.

36,"Oct 5, 2020 2:43PM EDT","Lithium mining stocks exploded higher in Monday trading. As of noon EDT, shares of Lithium Americas (NYSE: LAC) are up 9.9%, LiventÂ (NYSE: LTHM) stock has gained 13.5%, and Piedmont Lithium (NASDAQ: PLL) is doing best of all -- up a staggering 19.3%.But there's only a really good reason for one of these stocks to be rising, and it's not Piedmont.Image source: Getty Images.Over the weekend, Barron's ran an article discussing the rising demand for lithium to manufacture electric car batteries. The publication used last week's supply deal between Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Piedmont Lithium as its kickoff point, explaining that a lack of lithium is the ""only one thing standing between TeslaÂ andÂ world domination."" Â You might think this would logically lead to Barron's endorsing Piedmont Lithium stock, seeing as it is the company that just signed the deal with the electric vehicle (EV) maker. But Piedmont had already gained plenty already -- shooting up 236% on the day of the pact's announcement. Instead of chasing that stock higher, Barron's turned its attention to other miners such as Albemarle, Sociedad QuÃ­mica y Minera de Chile and Livent, encouraging investors to look into these more established lithium suppliers instead.Of these three stocks, by the way, Barron's concluded that ""Livent looks like the best bet""Â -- and certainly not Lithium Americas or Piedmont, neither of which is yet producing lithium at commercial scale.Barron's noted that global lithium production yields ""roughly 400,000 tons of lithium a year"" right now, theoretically ""enough to power 2 million to 3 million electric vehicles"" (but in fact, only a third of this production is available for EVs, because laptops, cellphones, and other rechargeable devices need lithium, too). In order to reach Elon Musk's goal of producing 30 million Teslas by the end of this decade, warns the magazine, lithium production ""will have to increase perhaps as much as tenfold.""Pricing remains a risk. The publication notes that, after peaking around $25,000 a ton in 2018, lithium prices have fallen to around $7,000 a ton over the past year. But even at that rate, so much demand creates an opportunity for new players -- so once they're up and running, start-ups Piedmont and Lithium Americas could still become players in this industry. In the meantime, however, Barron's urges investors to focus their research on businesses that are already operational and profitable.I think that's sound advice -- for lithium stocks, and for any stocks at all.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

37,"Oct 5, 2020 2:00PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhether you are a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock bull or bear, it is the most fascinating stock of 2020. Tesla stock detached from the company’s fundamentals long ago. However, it’s important for traders to monitor the latest fundamental headlines, nonetheless.On Friday, Tesla reported record third-quarter vehicle deliveries. For a normal auto stock, record deliveries would be an excellent reason to buy the stock. But Tesla shares initially traded lower by more than 4% on the news.Here’s a look at what investors need to know.The first thing I always recommend investors do when analyzing Tesla stock is forget about the share price. Forget about Eon Musk’s latest tweets. Forget about how you feel about global warming. Just look at the numbers.Tesla delivered 139,300 vehicles in the third quarter, a record for the company. That number also exceeded analyst expectations of 137,000 vehicles, according to FactSet. Beating expectations is always good news. Third-quarter deliveries were up 53.6% compared to the second quarter.Year-to-date, Tesla has delivered 318,350 vehicles, up 24.7% from the first three quarters of 2019. Those numbers represent a solid growth rate for Tesla.The company has previously said it will “comfortably exceed” 500,000 deliveries in 2020. So, Tesla will now need to report another record of 181,650 deliveries in the fourth quarter to meet its guidance.For investors who own any other auto or tech stocks, the analysis above is a typical assessment of a major financial disclosure. However, Tesla stock is the exception to pretty much every rule of investing. It appears extremely unlikely Tesla will hit 500,000 deliveries for the year. But Tesla rarely hits any of its financial targets, so investors may have already assumed a full-year delivery miss long ago.At the same time, Tesla stock showed huge gains this year. The company is literally worth nearly nine times as much as it was worth a year ago. Of course, Tesla didn’t deliver anywhere close to nine times as many vehicles in the third quarter as analysts were expecting this time last year.Tesla investors cheered the company’s $2.18 in adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter. But the stock has been repeatedly snubbed for inclusion in the S&P 500 index, potentially due to its heavy (and fleeting) reliance on regulatory credit sales.Revenue was down 4.9% in the second quarter. Free cash flow was down 32%.I recently wrote about how Tesla stock is extremely overvalued compared to both auto stock and high-growth tech stock peers.There are plenty of Tesla stock bulls out there that simply want to dismiss any talk of valuation. They argue that the company’s fundamentals will eventually line up with its market cap. But I have said just how much Tesla is overvalued today and just how long it takes to grow into that valuation will eventually matter.It took Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) more than 15 years to make it back to its dot-com bubble peak. Most investors know how much of a great growth company Microsoft is. I believe Tesla could potentially be lining up for its own 15 or 20 years of underperformance once the 2020 electric vehicle market mania starts to finally die down.Tesla reported some impressive delivery numbers in the third quarter. If the stock weren’t already up nearly 800% in the past year, I’d say it would make a great growth investment.“Tesla has a chance to be the dominant electric vehicle firm and is a leading autonomous vehicle player as well as a vertically integrated sustainable energy company with energy generation and storage products, but we do not see it having mass-market volume this decade,” Morningstar analyst David Whiston says.I agree with Whiston’s belief that Tesla could potentially dominate the global EV market in the long-term. Yet Whiston’s fair value estimate for Tesla stock is just $195, or about 54% below its current level. That target seems fair as well considering Tesla’s absurd valuation.I have repeatedly said Tesla is a great company with a laughable $400 billion valuation. It’s too dangerous to short because of its large short interest and the mania surrounding the 2020 EV bubble. But it is also too dangerous to buy given it is extremely overvalued, even compared to higher-growth tech stocks.Investors should do themselves a favor and stay on the sidelines when it comes to Tesla stock.On the date of publication, Wayne Duggan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.Wayne Duggan has been a U.S. News & World Report Investing contributor since 2016 and is a staff writer at Benzinga, where he has written more than 7,000 articles.

38,"Oct 5, 2020 1:36PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNio (NYSE:NIO) has raced into pole position ahead of the market. With bullish company news, solid price action and a broader market correction in the rearview mirror, Nio investors should be ready to ride a favorable risk-adjusted trend to big-time profits. Let me explain.Bearish seasonality lived up to its reputation in September. The leading tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to dive 13%. Fear was the co-pilot to this u-turn, as the VIX exploded to a historically extreme reading of 38% at its worst. It’s the type of environment that takes down the best of them. And it did too.Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Costco (NASDAQ:COST). Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Market influencers and growth companies alike were hit and most often, endured even larger selloffs. Of course, that’s not surprising. Chinese luxury EV outfit Nio didn’t prove immune to the broad-based pressure either.At their weakest in September, shares of Nio plunged 25%. That’s nearly double the Nasdaq’s correction. Still, given NIO’s growth prospects, “smaller” valuation, foreign domicile and highly volatile industry, the much larger drop in shareholder value is typical of this type of investment. The only surprising item of notice might be that rival Tesla shed an even larger 34% at its low last month.Interestingly, both EV manufacturers bottomed together and weeks ahead of the broader market, which only found its technical footing the past several sessions. What’s more, conditions have only gotten better for Nio.NIO’s early leadership continued to pick up steam in September, while also managing to outperform its much larger competitor. Shares finished the month at record highs and up 11.60% for the period. At the same time, TSLA stock lost 14% despite rallying 30% from its low near $330 struck on Sept. 8. That’s good, right? Now, bulls are in the driver seat with a favorable broader market tailwind known as a follow-through day in place, Friday’s surprisingly strong, growth-filled monthly and Q3 deliveries data for Nio in hand.Oh, and the price chart will also help fuel further gains.
Source: Charts by TradingViewI’ve been bullish on Nio for some time now. Most recently, the stock was discussed at InvestorPlace as a purchase following late August’s corrective dip. The price action appeared to be a favorable opportunity to buy Nio on weakness. It was, but not before early September’s slightly larger penetration briefly took out technical support.More than proof of fallible price charts, a proffered collar strategy has thrived amid the volatility. Now, with Nio sitting near its prior all-time-highs after breaking out of triangular consolidation, the stock is demonstrating a pattern where relative and absolute price strength are worth buying into.My observation remains upbeat with the belief Nio can rally towards $30 by early next year. Again, though, and stressing even the best price action is merely a guide and not a guarantee of success, exposure in Nio continues to look well-served by a flexible, limited and reduced risk collar.For investors agreeable with what has been shared, one hedged vehicle of this kind which aligns itself with what we’re seeing off and on the price chart is the Nov $20 put / $26 call combination. Relative to Nio fetching $21.40 in the open market, this collar currently runs about 60 cents over the stock for a net purchase price of around $22.On the date of publication, Chris Tyler held, directly or indirectly, positions in Nio and its derivatives, but no other securities mentioned in this article.Chris Tyler is a former floor-based, derivatives market maker on the American and Pacific exchanges.

39,"Oct 5, 2020 1:07PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRight now, I’m going to give you one very good reason that long-term investors with multi-year horizons should buy small-cap stocks: The reality we live in today is being rapidly disrupted on all fronts.Electric vehicles are replacing diesel and gas cars globally. Autonomous driving is quickly becoming a reality. Plant-based foods are taking over grocery stores and fast food chains.Shopping and payments are increasingly becoming digitized. Consumer and legislative attitudes towards formerly taboo drugs like marijuana and psychedelics are fundamentally shifting. Gambling and sports betting are being legalized.Data is transforming and optimizing every facet of business. Clean energy costs have fallen to grid-parity, and consumer adoption is soaring. AR/VR technology is revolutionizing gaming.Robots are becoming a real, useful thing. Cloud computing is becoming ubiquitous. The space tourism boom is starting…I could go on and on.But the point couldn’t get any clearer.The world is rapidly changing. Faster than ever before. And where there’s change, there’s opportunity.So, over the next 5 to 10 years, there will ample opportunity for small companies on the cutting edge of these disruptive, next-generation megatrends to unseat incumbent giants who have fallen asleep at the wheel.Much like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is unseating Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM).Much like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has unseated Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT).And much like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has unseated movie theaters.All three of those disruptors used to be small-cap companies, and right now — given the accelerated pace of technology disruption happening across the globe — is as good a time as any to find the next Tesla, the next Amazon and the next Netflix in the small-cap world.To that end, here are three of my favorite small-cap stocks to buy for long-term investors: In short, Luminar is the world’s best LiDAR company, and therefore, represents a compelling long-term investment opportunity as LiDAR technology becomes ubiquitous across the automobile world over the next decade.Taking a step back, the key to making semi-autonomous and fully autonomous vehicles lies in enabling cars to have complete “vision” – or, more specifically, giving them a human-like ability to see and respond to their surroundings.Ideally, you want to do this with built-in cameras, since cameras are space and cost efficient. But computer vision has significant limitations, so it has become commonplace across the AV space to equip cars with add-on, laser light perception sensors called LiDAR which – while less space-efficient and more costly – are presently a much more robust solution for 3D sensing/perception than cameras.Over the next decade, as every car on the road becomes semi-autonomous or fully autonomous, every car on the road will be equipped with these LiDAR sensors.Because of this, the LiDAR space has become exceptionally competitive, crowded with tons of hardware tech companies trying to make the best LiDAR sensors.But the cream-of-the-crop in this industry is Luminar Technologies, a company that has created the industry’s only independent viable long-range LiDAR.Specifically, Luminar’s sensors feature max resolution of 300 PD (pixels/degree) and 250 meter range. All other independent LiDAR sensors in the world have a max resolution of less than 100 PD, and a range of less than 150 meters. Meanwhile, Luminar’s LiDAR is also weather resilient and interference-proof.That’s why 7 of the top 10 passenger car OEMs have partnered with Luminar, while one — Volvo — is set to start rolling out cars with Luminar LiDARs by 2022.So will begin a huge ramp in Luminar from no installations today, to being installed on tens of millions of cars every year by the end of the decade. As that ramp happens, Luminar stock will morph into a huge winner. One huge and rapidly growing vertical in the food and beverage market that is primed for disruption over the next decade is the energy drink category.At $60 billion, the global energy drink market is one of the larger beverage markets in the world. With a 7% compounded annual growth rate, it’s also the fastest growing beverage category.The major players in this space – Red Bull, Monster, and Rockstar – have innovated over the past several years, coming out with new flavors, new packaging, and new marketing. But they haven’t innovated where it matters… on the healthy eating front… and for the most part, they all still sell sugar-loaded, not-that-good-for-you energy drinks.This reality represents an enormous opportunity for Celsius Holdings, a $1.7 billion beverage company that is optimally positioned to significantly disrupt the $60 billion energy drink market with its breakthrough functional healthy energy drink.Leaning into its proprietary scientific formulation which combines green tea with EGCG, ginger, and guarana seed to catalyze thermogenesis, Celsius has a created a portfolio of unique, functional healthy energy drinks that have been proven to energize, accelerate metabolism, and burn body fat and calories… all at once.Plus, the drinks are vegan. Gluten-free. Non-GMO. Contain zero sugar. Zero preservatives. Zero artificial colors or flavors. Zero aspartame.You know… all the good stuff that young consumers are looking for in a “clean label” these days.To that end, Celsius has created a scientifically superior and socially more relevant energy drink which has the potential to turn into the next big thing in this massive category.Indeed, this is already happening.Celsius has grown its sales by 337% since 2015. Revenues are up another 90% through the first half of 2020. And the company is already the 11th ranked brand in the U.S. energy drink market despite only being in ~10% of potential distribution channels.A 10X increase in that U.S. distribution – coupled with international expansion, healthy eating mega-tailwinds, and the company’s best-in-breed functional energy drink products – create a clear pathway for Celsius to keep growing revenues at a robust rate for the foreseeable future, and for CELH stock to turn into a multi-bagger. Last, but not least, on this list of small-cap stocks to buy for long-term investors in psychedelics leader Mind Medicine.In case you haven’t heard, we are in the first inning of the Shroom Boom — a wave wherein shifting scientific research coupled with social de-stigmatization will pave the way for legalization and widespread usage of psychedelic-inspired medicines for things like anxiety, depression and addiction.It all started in 2014, with a small study at Johns Hopkins University which found that psilocybin – aka “magic mushrooms” – helped people quit smoking. Specifically, the study found that psilocybin led to an 80% quit rate among active smokers, more than double what was standard across other, non-psychedelic studies at the time.Since then, a wave of academic research has emerged which supports the notion that psychedelic-inspired medicines are effective and superior treatments for things like addiction, ADHD, depression, anxiety and anorexia. At the same time, the media – much as it did with marijuana a decade ago – is helping destigmatize psychedelics today, with multiple Netflix shows and documentaries like Have a Good Trip: Adventures in Psychedelics.Broadly, then, the psychedelics industry today is where the marijuana industry was in 2015/16, in the midst of the changing public perception phase. What comes next? The legalization and commercialization phases.That’s when Mind Medicine stock will explode higher.Mind Medicine’s portfolio of psychedelic medicines are aimed at two huge markets: addiction and ADHD. Both treatments are in Phase 1/2 trials.If MindMed is successful in bringing psychedelic-inspired medicines for addiction and ADHD to market – and the company should be – the potential upside in MindMed stock is enormous, mostly because this is a $145 million company attacking a $12.1 billion market in terms of opiod abuse and ADHD treatments.On the date of publication, Luke Lango did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The New Daily 10X Stock Report: 98.7% Accuracy – Gains Up to 466.78%.

40,"Oct 5, 2020 12:46PM EDT","InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt’s been a surprisingly quiet year for investors of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock. Shares are up just 26%, lagging far behind Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) 54% rise and Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) eye-popping near-400% gain. How did FB stock, a supposed winner of the work-from-home movement, get left behind? Actually, the company has been keeping up just fine.In the second quarter, Facebook blew Wall Street’s expectations out of the water. Revenues beat estimates by 7.4%, per-share profits by 22.7% and daily user growth by roughly 3%.These are staggeringly large beats for a $750 billion enterprise. And as the company weathers the 2020 election and coronavirus pandemic, shareholders will quickly realize one thing: that Facebook has become a spring-loaded stock.Investors, get ready for a great comeback for Facebook stock in 2021.While you’ll usually find me reporting on smaller tech companies that can grow 10x to 1,000x, Facebook deserves a special mention during these extraordinary times. The company, which also owns Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, has been a massive coronavirus pandemic success story. Facebook’s shares have lagged, but stand to rebound in 2021 as valuations catch back upIn Q2, Facebook’s revenue-per-share grew 10.2%, and profits almost doubled as advertisers shifted spending online. And it’s clear why advertisers chose Facebook in particular: the social media giant added yet another 200 million monthly active users (MAU) in 2020, bringing total users to 2.7 billion. The company now counts well over a third of the planet as actively monthly users. User engagement has also soared: 79% of active Facebook users now log in daily, an all-time high.Yet, these gains have gone almost undetected by Wall Street. Shares have lagged other tech giants as investors have fretted about Facebook’s slowing growth and turned their attention to younger upstarts like TikTok.Nonsense.Not only has Facebook done well in 2020. Analysts expect the company to do even better in 2021.  As the overall advertising industry regains health, analysts expect Facebook’s revenue to increase by 24% in 2021. Morningstar, a financial services firm, pegs the number even higher, at 34%.There are three critical reasons for optimism. Firstly, analysts expect overall ad spending to return to pre-pandemic growth in 2021. The extra advertising dollars will decrease competition and boost Facebook’s bottom line.Secondly, Facebook has emerged from this summer’s political stumble relatively unscathed. In June and July, the company faced a boycott by large brands and advertisers over its lack of controls over limiting hate speech. While these walkouts could dent Q3 numbers, the company has since installed enough measures to right the ship.Finally, the company stands to benefit from a societal shift toward social media news. And not just in the U.S. either. In India, Facebook’s largest market by users, a study by the Hammerkopf Consumer Survey found an 87% increase in social media usage during the beginnings of the coronavirus pandemic.And here’s what that means for Facebook’s value in 2021.Analysts expect Facebook to grow revenues at a moderate 13.8% CAGR over the next ten years. EBIT margins are expected to increase from 42.0% to 54.5% by mid-decade.Using these relatively conservative estimates (and projecting EBIT margins to revert to 42% by 2029), a 2-stage DCF model shows a fair value of $377/share or a 47.5% upside from today’s prices. In other words, Facebook’s underlying value has steadily marched upwards, even though its stock price has not.What about its fast-growing tech peers? A similar DCF model using the same discount rates on Apple shows a -10.9% downside. And what about Tesla, with its 400% YTD gain? A sweat-inducing -58.0% downside.These valuation issues show up in basic ratio analysis (a helpful guide I like to use outside of DCF models). Facebook trades for 23.6 times EV/EBIT – a high ratio, but not absurd for a software company. Apple, on the other hand, now trades for 27.0 times, a princely sum for a company that still earns 2/3 of revenues from hardware sales. And what about Tesla? The electric vehicle maker now trades at 307 times EV/EBIT, making it one of the most expensive large-cap companies in the world. In other words, Facebook remains quite cheap despite its rapid growth.Things won’t be 100% smooth sailing for Facebook, either. The social media firm must continue walking a fine line between maximizing user engagement and stopping the spread of misinformation. That’s no easy task in the era of partisan politics.The company also needs to address consumer privacy and antitrust concerns. Among other warning signs: in 2019, the Federal Trade Commission levied a record-breaking $5 billion fine on Facebook. “Despite repeated promises to its billions of users worldwide that they could control how their personal information is shared, Facebook undermined consumers’ choices,” said FTC Chairman Joe Simons. “The magnitude of the $5 billion penalty … is designed not only to punish future violations but, more importantly, to change Facebook’s entire privacy culture to decrease the likelihood of continued violations.”Finally, Facebook must continue innovating to stay on top. It acquired two of its most valuable properties (WhatsApp and Instagram) for just $5 billion together; WhatsApp now has 2 billion users, while Instagram has 1 billion. But can the company repeat its success? Perhaps, but even the mightiest of companies can always fall.When I invest in tech companies for massive gains, I look for companies with 1) strong proprietary software, 2) a great growth trajectory, and 3) proven management. Not only does Facebook have all three. Its shares are also screaming “it’s on sale!” relative to other U.S. tech companies. And that’s what makes me excited for this social media behemoth.Consumer shifts in the work-from-home era have given Facebook a much-needed lift. If the company can take advantage, shares could pop 40% in 2021. Perhaps it’s time to buy.On the date of publication, Tom Yeung did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Tom Yeung, CFA, is a registered investment advisor on a mission to bring simplicity to the world of investing.The post How Facebook Could Surge 40% in 2021, Crushing Apple and Tesla appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-facebook-could-surge-40-in-2021-crushing-apple-and-tesla-2020-10-05

41,"Oct 5, 2020 11:11AM EDT","Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) popped on Monday, rising as much as 4.5%. As of about 10:30 a.m. EDT, however, the stock was up 3.3%.The growth stock's gain comes as Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner released a note to investors saying that the stock's sell-off on Friday created a good buying opportunity.Tesla factory. Image source: The Motley Fool.Shares of Tesla declined more than 7% last Friday, following the electric-car maker's latest update on vehicle deliveries and production. Though the record 139,300 deliveries Tesla reported during the third quarter were slightly ahead of analysts' average estimate, they may have been underwhelming to some investors -- particularly since the stock has been on a tear over the last 12 months, leading to high expectations.The analyst noted that the deliveries were ""robust"" and that they prompted him to increase his revenue forecast for Q3 from $8.2 billion to $8.3 billion.In September, Rosner increased his 12-month price target for Tesla stock from $400 to $500 and changed his rating from hold to buy. The analyst reiterated this buy rating today.Â An upbeat morning in the overall market likely helped Tesla stock Monday morning as well. TheÂ S&P 500 was up more than 1% as of this writing.Next, investors will look to see if management reiterates its guidance for a total of 500,000 deliveries in 2020 when Tesla reports third-quarter earnings late this month or early next month. To achieve this guidance, the company will need another period of record deliveries.

42,"Oct 5, 2020 10:00AM EDT","Lithium AmericasÂ (NYSE: LAC) stock has produced electrifying recent gains. Shares of the Canada-based junior lithium mining company skyrocketed 44.2% in September and have raced out of the gate in October, gaining 29.1% in the first two trading days of the month. That brings their total gain to 86.1% in just over a month.The company isn't currently generating any revenue or profits. It has two mining projects under development: Cauchari-Olaroz in Argentina, a 51%-49% joint venture with China's Ganfeng Lithium, in which Lithium Americas is the minority owner; and Thacker Pass in Nevada. For context, the S&P 500 (including dividends) fell 3.8% last month and lost 4.2% from Sept. 1 to Oct. 2.Here's what investors should know.A lithium salt flat. Image source: Getty Images.We can probably boil the bulk of Lithium Americas' powerful recent market performance down to two related industrywide factors.Â First, expectations seem to be increasing that demand for lithium to make rechargeable batteries for electric vehicles (EVs) will be pulled forward relative to recent projections. (This sentiment excludes the shorter-term negative effect stemming from the pandemic.) In other words, the belief is growing that EVs will displace vehicles with combustion engines faster than previously expected.Second, lithium stocks, in general, are benefiting from increased awareness among investors of the lithium space. This factor stems from the growth in news coverage of EVs, which is how this catalyst relates to the first one.What's driving (pun intended) the belief that EVs are going to be kings of the road sooner than previously expected, and the rising investor awareness that they can bet on the EV revolution by investing in lithium stocks?Several things, including a California executive order and news from EV pioneer Tesla'sÂ (NASDAQ: TSLA) ""Battery Day.""Â On Sept. 23, California Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an executive order ""requiring sales of all new passenger vehicles to be zero-emission by 2035."" The order effectively bans the sale of new cars powered by fossil fuels within the state in 15 years. It also includes other provisions aimed at controlling climate change.Â  Not surprisingly, California is on track to be the first state in the U.S. to phase out gasoline- and diesel-fueled cars, though 15 other countries have also committed to doing so, according to the state's press release.The Golden State's move is obviously a boost for EVs, as the state is the largest car market in the country. Moreover, it seems likely that other states will follow California's lead.Â On Sept. 22, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced during the company's ""Battery Day"" plans to enter the lithium mining space. The aim of taking control of a key part of its supply chain is to ensure it has adequate lithium supplies and to lower its lithium costs.If Tesla is successful, it will mean that eventually, at least, it won't need to buy 100% of its lithium from third-party suppliers, as it does now.Â Overall, this news is a negative for lithium producers, as the industry will lose some key business if Tesla is successful. However, the event certainly brought the lithium industry to the attention of more investors.Â Data by YCharts.Here's the year-to-date performance picture for Lithium Americas stock.Data by YCharts.Investors should know that Lithium Americas stock is very speculative. As previously noted, the company is in the developmental stage, and isn't generating any revenue or profits.That said, it's worth watching.Less speculative investors interested in the lithium space might want to explore larger players Albemarle, Sociedad Quimica y Minera (known as SQM), and Livent. U.S.-based Livent is a pure play on lithium, while fellow U.S. company Albemarle and Chile-based SQM also produce other products.10 stocks we like better than Lithium Americas Corp.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The electric vehicle (EV) company, founded by car designer Henrik Fisker, will list on the NYSE later this year through the special purpose company. And at $14, SPAQ stock could reward investors handsomely. I’m typically wary of growth companies without any operating history. Fisker’s management also has completely unrealistic expectations for the company’s growth.But a closer look at the company business shows a company worth far more than its current $4.3 billion valuation. While I wouldn’t put in my entire life savings into this backdoor listing, here’s why SPAQ stock could become the next Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) if they play their cards right.For those less familiar with the SPAQ/Fisker deal, here’s a quick primer:A particular class of firms, known as Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPAQs), are blank-check companies that take other firms public. They typically hold cash in trust, issue shares worth $10, and either list a company or dissolves within a timeframe.Spartan Energy, one of these SPAQs, was created by private equity giant Apollo Global Management. And in July, the blank-check company agreed to merge with Fisker, an electric vehicle startup.Why is this important? That’s because SPAQ stock should theoretically never fall far below its $10 liquidation value before its merger with Fisker. That means investors have reasonable downside protection.My colleagues at InvestorPlace have already written some excellent articles on why SPAQ might be undervalued, given Fisker’s growth estimates. Even my estimates put SPAQ share value at $21.Would-be investors, however, should avoid using Fisker’s estimates in their valuations. Here’s why.In July, Fisker released an investor presentation projecting $13.2 billion in revenue by 2025. By outsourcing production to Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY), they reasoned, the company could instantaneously ramp up production to meet surging demand.That seems like a stretch, but let’s run with that for a moment. Imagine that management delivers on the proposed $13.2 billion revenue and a 14.4% EBIT margin. Using a 2-stage discounted cash flow (DCF) model shows a company value of $25.6 billion, or $87 per share, a 480% upside.Skeptical readers will immediately see an issue: $13.2 billion is a lot of money for a car maker. To reach that target, Fisker would have to sell 250,000 SUVs a year, or 62,000 more units than Tesla’s entire 2019 U.S. sales.Can that happen? Of course. But here’s why investors should stay skeptical.There are three reasons why investors shouldn’t expect more than $5 billion in revenue by 2025.1. Car Dealerships. U.S. states largely prohibit direct sales of cars to consumers. That means Fisker will face an uphill battle to open “brand experience centers” and pop-up stores. Tesla took years to establish itself, and many states still ban the EV company from making in-person sales.2. One Base Model. Fisker initially plans to sell just one SUV model, the Fisker Ocean. To reach $13.2 billion in revenue by 2025, the company would have to become roughly as popular as the Honda Accord or Jeep Grand Cherokee in the U.S.3. Financing Deals. Fisker plans to offer its leases at $379 monthly on a $2,999 down payment. No fixed term, unlike Tesla’s 36-month minimum. That means each “sale” will only net the company $7,547 in its first year.The final point could wreak havoc on Fisker’s balance sheet: having no fixed lease terms will reclassify the deals as “capital leases” rather than “operating leases.” In other words, unless their accountants can come up with a creative way to offload the leases or reclassify them, Fisker can only recognize $7,547 revenue in its first year.Had Fisker’s management thought of that, they would quickly realize that *if* 100% of their customers leased rather than bought, generating $13.2 billion (from a standing start) means selling 1.75 million leases, the equivalent of 10% of the U.S. car market.To see what’s at stake, let’s make a couple of assumptions:Using a 2-stage DCF model comes to a fair value of $6.2 billion, or $21 per share. That’s a 43% upside.However, there’s significant uncertainty in Fisker’s leasing situation. If the company needs 25% working capital to fund its capital lease program, its fair value immediately drops to just $16 per share, leaving only a 9% upside.On balance, SPAQ stock remains a buy. The $10 pre-merger price floor means investors have a limited downside if they buy today. And if Fisker succeeds, investors stand to earn multiples of their original investment.The company also has strong management, packed with BMW (OTCMKTS:BMWYY) and Volkswagen veterans. And despite CEO Henrik Fisker’s prior EV startup failure (prompted by a total recall of its outsourced batteries), he looks far better to succeed this time. The Spartan Energy team consists of experienced private equity managers from Apollo Global and may yet provide a viable financing source for Fisker’s leasing program.As Fisker looks to move beyond SUVs and into luxury sedans in 2023, investors should pay attention. If all goes well, Fisker and SPAQ could end up as the next Tesla.On the date of publication, Tom Yeung did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Tom Yeung, CFA, is a registered investment advisor on a mission to bring simplicity to the world of investing.The post SPAQ and Fisker Are Still a Buy, Despite Unrealistic Expectations appeared first on InvestorPlace.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/spaq-and-fisker-are-still-a-buy-despite-unrealistic-expectations-2020-10-05

46,"Oct 5, 2020 1:21AM EDT","TeslaâsÂ (NASDAQ: TSLA) network of Superchargers enables Tesla drivers to recharge their cars in as little as an hour, reducing range anxiety and improving the experience of owning a Tesla. Below, we take a look at how Teslaâs supercharger network is expanding and compare its growth with the companyâs cumulative deliveries and rival charging networks.View our dashboard analysis onÂ A Closer Look At Teslaâs Charging InfrastructureTeslaâs Supercharger Network Is Growing, But Not Quickly EnoughTeslaâs Supercharger network has grown from around 1,200 stations in Q1â18 to over 2035 stations as of Q2â20. The number of Supercharger connectors, which indicate the number of vehicles that can be charged simultaneously, has expanded from 9.3k to 18k over the same period. The number of Supercharger connectors per Supercharger location has expanded modestly from 7.7 to 8.9 over the period. However, with the launch of the Model 3 and Model Y, and Teslaâs rapid production scale-up, the number of Teslas on the road is outpacing the growth of its Supercharger network. As Teslaâs Cumulative deliveries have grown from 320k in Q1â19 to 1.1 million in Q2â20, this means that the number of Vehicles per Connector has grown from under 35 in early 2018 to about 60 presently. Tesla owners can still use third-party networks (which may require adapters) although the speed and experience are unlikely to be the same as using Teslaâs own supercharging. How Does Teslaâs Network Of Chargers Compare With Rivals?Tesla is still ahead of its rivals when it comes to fast charging â with a total of over 9,600 supercharger points in North America. In comparison, ChargePoint, an independent network of EV chargers, has about 2,020 DC fast charging points while Volkswagenâs Electrify America network has about 2,000 points.Â  However, Teslaâs overall network, which includes fast chargers and slower Level 2 chargers stands at about 20k in North America. This is well behind ChargePoint which has close to 35k charging connectors.Further Buildouts, Battery Improvements Could Help Tesla Address A ShortfallHowever, there are a couple of ways Tesla could address a potential congestion issue. The first and most obvious solution would be to build out more Superchargers. Tesla now has adequate capital to do so, holding about $9 billion in cash as of the most recent quarter. In addition to this,Â  Tesla will likely count on improving the range of its new cars to reduce their dependence on chargers. Tesla can do this via more compact and cost-efficient batteries or other drivetrain improvements. For example, during its battery day event, the company said that its new âtablessâ batteries could enhance range by 16%.

47,"Oct 4, 2020 1:26PM EDT","Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) slumped 13.9% in September, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The electric vehicle (EV) company is one of the most hotly contested stocks on the market, but so far bulls have been clear winners -- with the stock climbing roughly 396% year to date and nearly 500% over the last three years.Â ^SPX data by YChartsTesla stock experienced volatility early in the month due to waning excitement following its stock split at the end of August and the company being passed over for inclusion in the S&P 500 index. Shares saw additional pressure from analyst coverage and a mixed reception for the Battery Day conference it held on Sep. 22.Image source: Getty Images.Whether you're bull or bear or just keeping track of a high-flying industry leader, Tesla's double-digit slide last month should be viewed in context. The company's share price skyrocketed 74% across August's trading thanks to momentum for the business and excitement about its 5-for-1 stock. September's pullback looks relatively small in light of those gains, even though there were significant events driving the sell-off.Â On the heels of stock-split excitement dissipating, Tesla shares experienced a sell-off early in September after the company was passed over for inclusion in the S&P 500 index. The stock sank 15% on Sep. 8's trading after news hit that the company failed to gain a spot on the index.Inclusion in a major index is often a positive catalyst for stocks because investors buying index funds are buying stock in the included companies. There hasn't been an official explanation for why the S&P Dow Jones Indices team opted not to add Tesla to the S&P 500 index, instead choosing to add Teradyne, Catalent, and Etsy. However, it's possible that doubts about the EV leader's ability to post continued profits (consistent profitability is typically a standard for index inclusion) played a role. Tesla posted its first full-year profit when it reported fourth quarter results in January.Â Tesla shares rebounded in the week of trading following the indexing-related sell-off and then plateaued mid-month, then proceeded to tumble again after the company's Battery Day presentation underwhelmed investors and analysts. The event had been hyped as a potential showcase for revolutionary battery technology, but the tech may not have been as groundbreaking as some expected.Tesla did unveil its biscuit tin battery cell, which the company says will pave the way for a 16% increase in its vehicles' range capacity and also be less expensive to produce.Â Elon Musk and Co. also used the event to debut its high-powered Model S Plaid car and highlight new autopilot technologies, that Cybertruck had received over half a million preorders, and plans for an electric vehicle in the $25,000 price range. The conference featured plenty of notable news, but it was followed by coverage from multiple analysts branding the showcase a disappointment.Â Tesla stock has lost additional ground early in October's trading, after the company delivered third quarter results that appear to have underwhelmed Wall Street on some fronts. Volatility for the broader market and growth-dependent stocks in particular may have also been a factor in the dip. The EV company's stock is down roughly 3.2% in the month so far.^SPX data by YChartsTesla shares climbed on Oct. 1, but sank on Oct. 2 after the company announced vehicle deliveries that fell short of the market's expectations. The company delivered 139,300 vehicles in the third quarter, a new quarterly record, but some investors seem to have been looking for even greater performance.Tesla is now valued at $387.5 billion and trades at roughly 224 times this year's expected earnings and 13 times expected sales.10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

48,"Oct 4, 2020 9:00AM EDT","By David RandallNEW YORK, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Investors on Wall Street can add another layer of uncertainty to a market already unnerved by last month's sell-off, stalled fiscal stimulus and President Donald Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis, which weighed on stocks on Friday.     A higher capital gains tax that could accompany a win by Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is also emerging as a potential counterweight to this year's powerful rally in stocks.Biden has proposed taxing capital gains and dividends as ordinary income, which would increase the tax rate from 20% to 39.6% for individuals and couples earning over $1 million, the highest tax bracket.That policy - which would likely be easier to enact if Democrats also win the Senate and retain control of the House - may push some investors to lock in gains ahead of December if Biden emerges the winner in the Nov. 3 vote, fund managers said.Tax-motivated selling would likely be most pronounced in technology and other momentum stocks and could push the broad S&P 500 index lower between November and the end of the year, said Eddie Perkin, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance.""If you have enough people looking to harvest gains, that has an impact on the stocks that have led the market, and the big tech stocks could be where people choose to sell at the end of the year,"" he said.On Friday, President Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis triggered a sell-off in stocks and oil as investors moved away from risk assets.  But many tech and momentum stocks are sporting healthy gains for the year despite a sell-off that pushed the S&P 500 down 3.9% in September, its first monthly loss since March.Tesla Inc TSLA.O, for instance, is up 436% for the year through Friday, while Zoom Video Communications Inc ZM.O is up 610% and Amazon.com Inc is up 74%. The S&P 500 index as a whole is up 3.8% over the same time.That kind of momentum may be difficult to slow, especially if it is aided by seasonal trends. November and December tend to be among the best months for stock performance, boasting an average gain of 1.34% and 1.57%, respectively, for the S&P 500, according to research firm CFRA.""The third quarter is usually weak, but when it is really strong, like it was in 2020, this says the rally isn’t over yet,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.Still, some believe a Biden victory would provide a strong incentive for profit-taking. SELLING 'AHEAD OF SCHEDULE'Chris Cordaro, chief investment officer of RegentAtlantic, believes a broad Democratic victory will likely lead to more stock market volatility as soon as the results of the election are known as investors start selling winners.He has been counseling some clients to generate more income this year as opposed to in 2021, by taking money out of retirement accounts, which would add another layer of selling, he said.""You're going to see people selling things that they would be selling anyway, but ahead of schedule,"" he said.Investors in the coming week will be keeping an eye on minutes from the Federal Reserve's most recent monetary policy meeting, due out Wednesday, for insight on how the central bank views the nascent recovery in the United States. Higher taxes do not always lead to increased selling. Overall, the capital gains tax rate could go as high as 40% before having widespread effects on investor behavior and discouraging investment, according to a paper by Princeton University economics professors Owen Zidar and Ole Agersnap.Personal income tax rates are more likely to affect the market's winners this year, Cordaro said, while increased corporate taxes would most likely lower valuations across the stock market over the next year.By 2024, however, enactment of Biden's proposed tax measures and other policies would cut just 4% off of estimated earnings for the S&P 500 compared with baseline estimates, according to Goldman Sachs.Increasing corporate taxes while the global economy is still trying to recover from the coronavirus pandemic could dent the rally in the stock market and cut into company plans to hire or invest in new projects by eating into after-tax net income, saidhedge fund manager J. Daniel Plants, who runs Voce Capital Management.""History teaches us that this is the worst possible moment to subject the economy to the type of massive tax increases that Biden is proposing, especially the changes that would impede capital formation and make domestic job creation less attractive,"" he said.(Reporting by David Randall.

49,"Oct 4, 2020 6:32AM EDT","Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), saw his net worth briefly cross the $200 billion threshold earlier this year. He's the richest man in history, and he added billions to his wealth during the COVID-19 pandemic -- a time when millions, perhaps even including yourself, were unemployed and waiting for federal stimulus checks to buy groceries.Bezos isn't alone. Consider a recent headline from Business Insider: ""US billionaires' wealth grew by $845 billion during the first six months of the pandemic."" At first glance, it looks like billionaires are getting richer at the expense of everyone else. That hardly seems fair.However, there's another headline you may have missed. American household wealth is at an all-time high, having recovered trillions in value since the lows following the coronavirus outbreak. Are you wondering how that's even possible? The sad reality is the wealth gains haven't been evenly distributed. But the good news is what's worked for the rich can work for you too.Image source: Getty Images.According to a report from the Institute for Policy Studies, eight billionaires increased their net worth by over $1 billion each from the beginning of 2020 through April 10. The organization dubbed these billionaires as ""Pandemic Profiteers."" The list includes the aforementioned Bezos, TeslaÂ CEO Elon Musk, and Eric Yuan of Zoom Video Communications.When news broke that Bezos was worth over $200 billion, protestors descended upon his house, according to the Washington Examiner. The protest called for raising employee compensation to a minimum of $30 per hour, but it took a dark turn as protestors assembled a guillotine on the sidewalk. Suffice it to say many people aren't happy with the disproportionate creation of wealth for Bezos and other billionaires.Ensuring all stakeholders are justly compensated is an important conversation. However, there's a common misconception regarding net worth. Protestors claimed Bezos makes $4,000 per second in income, and similar statements abound in cyberspace. But in reality, billionaires are getting richer because their assets, like stocks, are increasing in value.Â AMZN data by YChartsBezos, Musk, and Yuan own a ton of their own companies' stock. For example, at the end of 2019, Bezos owned over 75 million shares of Amazon -- a nice perk from founding the company. His net worth increases as the stock rises, but he's not getting paid thousands of dollars per second. In reality, his CEO salary is just $81,840 and doesn't include any ongoing stock-based compensation. In short, there's a big difference between wealth and income.According to the Federal Reserve, U.S. household net worth is also rising due to increasing asset value -- just like the aforementioned billionaires. Much of Americans' wealth is in real estate, which has increased $900 billion in value since the beginning of 2020. Additionally, a full 27% of American household wealth is currently in the stock market. And, believe it or not, stocks are up in 2020.American household net worth was $119 trillion as of the second quarter of 2020. This is up by approximately $8 trillion since the first quarter. Granted, it's less than a 1% increase from the fourth quarter of 2019. But it's a record high nonetheless.So billionaires have enriched themselves in this tumultuous 2020, yes. However, they're not alone. These numbers show many American households have never been richer.Image source: Getty Images.This doesn't mean wealth gains have been evenly distributed; on the contrary, there is a wealth gap. Again according to the Federal Reserve, the bottom 50% of Americans owned just 1.4% of the wealth. By contrast, the top 10% have 69% of the pie.Â That's hardly proportionate. Furthermore, low-income workers remain unemployed in high numbers compared with those in higher-paying professions.More companies need to embrace the primary tenets of conscious capitalism -- the business practice of increasing value for all stakeholders. And legislators should actively pursue opportunities aligning with our ""justice for all"" national mantra. But on an individual level, I believe there's an urgently actionable takeaway. To create personal wealth, you must use some of your income to acquire assets. Those who do have gotten richer in 2020.Bezos, Musk, and Yuan are entrepreneurs who've created multibillion-dollar businesses from scratch. Maybe that's not you. Nevertheless, you can still align your future net worth with successful billionaires like these by investing in the stock market. Stocks are an incredible wealth-creating tool, allowing common folks like you and me to build wealth from businesses taking the world by storm. And it's exactly how many everyday Americans got richer even during a global pandemic.The stock market doesn't care if you're rich or poor; it's available to virtually anyone, and the bar to get started has never been lower. Brokerages have introduced new features like commission-free trades, fractional shares, and no account balance minimums, all which can help you get started today.10 stocks we like better than AmazonWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.
